The other thing...[and I feel awful having to say this because nobody else has] ...is that breakfast was a little uncomfortable [ bit too intimate! ],OTHER
as we had to keep sharing a table with someone because the room was so tiny [ a converted cellar I think] and there was a maximum number of tables- so if everyone came down at once in the morning it would be chaos!!!,BUILDING
The lady waitress was a bit slow on the uptake and didnt understand much of what we were saying but we just didnt let it get to us.Nevertheless this hotel is good value for money and I agree with most of the comments made and the manager has done his best to make sure nobody has a bad time.,SERVICE

This is mostly where the Majestic loses 1 star.,FOOD
The food doesn't even compare to cruise food.,FOOD
"If you haven't cruised before, then you'd probably think the food was pretty good.",FOOD

I always got my eggs or omleets prepared by the cook to ensure they were fresh.,FOOD
The crepes were my favourite part of breakfast.,FOOD
Lunch at the Beach buffet was OK.,FOOD

Le Gourmet was good.,FOOD
It was nice to finally eat at a restaurant that wasn't buffet.,FOOD
I probably enjoyed the main buffet the best just for the variety.,FOOD
I found at all places they tend to cook with ALOT of oils and salt.,FOOD
There is no way I could stay beyond 1 week at the Majestic as the food choices were getting quite boring and routine after a few days.,FOOD
We never got sick thank goodness.,FOOD
The resort grounds are beautiful.,BUILDING
No complaints there.,BUILDING
We visited the Bahia Principe next door and were VERY glad we chose the Majestic as their layout is much more preferred.,BUILDING
