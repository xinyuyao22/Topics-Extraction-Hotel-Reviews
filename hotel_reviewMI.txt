This hotel was nice and quiet. Did not know, there was train track near by. But it was only few train passed during our stay. Best Western changed hotel classification. The Plus category are not the same as before.
We stayed in the king suite with the separation between the bedroom and the living space. The sofa bed wasn't very good I had back discomfort by the day we left on our three night stay. The room is clean, and the king bed very comfortable. This hotel is located within walking distance to most places you will want to... More
Parking was horrible, somebody ran into my rental car while staying there. I didn't get to try the breakfast, I was there for business so the restaurant opened to late for the business world to enjoy, I had to asked for coffee for my room, And the items in the vending machine were stale.
Not cheap but excellent location. Price is somewhat standard for not hacing reservations. But room was nice and clean. They offer good continental breakfast which is a plus and compensates. Front desk service and personnel where excellent. It is Carmel, no A/C in rooms but they have a fan for air circulation.
If you get the room that they advertised on the website and for what you paid, you may be lucky.If you stay many days , they will give you the not so good rooms.Nobody wants to stay in these rooms: low light/dark rooms, near pool, noisy, smelly bathrooms, or difficult access. If you stay one-two days you will get probably... More
This is such a fun, lovely hotel. The attention to detail is impressive, from the thicker rimmed water glasses to the extra fluffy towels. Loved the vibrant art which lends itself to a hip vibe. My only disappointment was at their restaurant, the Lockbox. The menu is just trying too hard. I am a fairly adventurous eater but each of... More
We recently stayed at this hotel on a trip to Lexington with other friends. Our group shared the feeling that we would not be back. We routinely waited more than 10 minutes for elevators. The workout room is tiny with 2 treadmills and 2 cheap elliptical machines that rocked off the floor when in use. Everything about the hotel seemed... More

This is a new Hampton Inn and is well decorated. The color scheme gives a feeling of luxury and is very restful. The beds are comfortable and the black out curtains keep the room dark for a good nights sleep. The entrance is a little difficult to find so look closely for the sign. The staff was very friendly and... More
I stayed here for three nights while I explored nearby Santa Barbara. This place is ok for a night or two, if you can live the excess noise coming from the freeway, then three nights is just about doable
Completely accommodating hotel! I booked a reservation last minute day of, used points to offset the cost and even called the front desk to ask for a little help. They were completely kind and welcoming, especially accommodating while under construction. Thank you!
The water is very hot and there's no cold water at all... It's awful.. The food is not good.. The staff is friendly and very nice.. More upscale items should be offered for the price of the room at 200. A night! Snacks, toiletries, menus and food and drinks offered.. Promote your business... I'm sorry to hear we didn't exceed your expectations but thank you for bringing these issues to our attention. We take your feedback seriously and will share it with the staff. I hope we'll get another opportunity to make a better impression when you return to New Orleans. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss your stay further. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Great staff and rooms. Housekeeping was always spot on--we never saw them come in, and it was in perfect order when we came back to our rooms. The hotel is close to everything, French Quarter, museums, business district, etc. And we got a GREAT price for our stay. It's an excellent value--highly recommend to anyone visiting New Orleans!
This Hotel, formerly a prestigious bank, may be attractive for history buffs, but is an expensive and horrible place to stay when you visit New Orleans. The rooms are SMALL, unattractive, with terrible old bedding, virtually without windows or amenities. Parking was 38/day, and it took 35 min. to get your vehicle. Almost no lobby or sitting area, the restaurant was small, understaffed, with a severely limited menu. The commode was crammed into a tiny bathroom, and we had to call down to get them to bring up an old beat-up refrigerator. There are SO Many other more attractive places to stay in New Orleans, less expensive, I would avoid this place like the plague.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit. Sincerely,Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Very accommodating staff. Competitive pricing for downtown N.O. convenient location. Comfortable room. Good food in restaurant. Broken exercise equipment. 'fitness club' is a bit of a misnomer. We can recommend this to anyone else for a good place to stay with great location for many attractions.Thank you very much for your comments about your most recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel! We are working on getting updated exercise equipment and I'm sorry it wasn't ready for you by the time you arrived. I am happy to hear that you had such an enjoyable stay overall and we hope to see you again the next time you come to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Room was much larger than I expected, and water and fridge were offered for my room - had everything I needed. Nice basic breakfast was included. Room was very clean and everyone here was friendly! Would stay again. We're thrilled to hear you had a great New Orleans experience at the Whitney Hotel. Thank you for mentioning the breakfast and the cleanliness of the rooms. Our staff strives for excellence and I'm glad to see that was provided. We hope to see you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The Whitney Hotel is ideally located to see most of the sights of New Orleans. I would say it is a place to lay your head but I found the restaurant poor in terms of food choice and quality. The room phone did not work, no room service offered and the room can be noisy as it overlooks a major road. Overall, I think we can do better on my next trip to New Orleans.Thank you mentioning how you enjoyed the location and cleanliness of the Hotel, I'll pass that information along. I'm sorry to hear about the telephone and will have Engineering test the line. On behalf of the Management of the restaurant, please accept my apologies. I'll make sure they get a copy of this review. Thank you again for your candid comments and we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. If we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This is an old hotel in very good location. A 5 minute walk to Bourbon Street and Harrahs' Casino. A 15 min walk will get you to Caffe DuMonde and the French Market. Although old, the hotel is well kept and the staff is efficient. I found the room a little bit small, but confortable.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The hotel is historic and yet modern. Full of history. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Orleans. Blocks from the French Quater and the Riverfront. The staff was very courtis and very knowledgeable. Always there to help get you where you want to be. Just one block to Mothers one of the local best restaurants. Totally enjoyed my stay On behalf of the staff at the Whitney Hotel, thank you so much for your recent visit and for the wonderful review. We'll share your praise with our staff and sincerely hope we'll get to see you again soon. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This hotel aptly named the Whitney Hotel as it was the location of the Whitney Bank.Several of the features of the bank era are there to be seen such as the strong room doors and related features.This hotel is in a very good location very close to local transportation - buses and streetcars.A short walk takes you to many places to eat, drink and shop.Less than ten minutes walk to Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street.Pleasant ambience, friendly staff and comfortable rooms. We had a noisy air con and after underlining our concerns were moved to another room and provided with free on the house breakfast.The hotel has partnership with some eating/licensed businesses plus a two for one offer for Mardi Gras World.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A.

We would like to thank the staff for taking such good care of us.Your knowledge of your wonderful city was so helpful. The Russells Thank you for your review of the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans!

We recently had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans and we chose to stay at the Whitney based on user reviews, location, and price. The room was very nice and was really clean. The hotel was well decorated. The one big call out I have is that the restaurant accepts room charges and cash only! As a rule, I won't support a business that doesn't accept credit cards for payment. Valet parking or a paid lot across the street are your parking options.Thank you for recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and for your kind comments. I'll be sure to pass this along to the staff. Please let us know if you need any reservation assistance in the future. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Our room was beautiful, the location was wonderful just a couple of blocks from shopping, Bourbon Street and an easy walk to Jackson Square. There are great restaurants in walking distance as well as the restaurant in the hotel. Dinner in the vault was fabulous.The service was outstanding.Even one of the maintenance men held doors for me and gave great advice on where to eat. Loved it and can't wait to go back. Thanks especially to Jason who really took great care of us.We appreciate your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and are so happy to hear you enjoy your stay! We'll pass along your kind comments to the staff and we look forward to hosting your next New Orleans trip! Feel free to call the hotel directly for any travel needs. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Excellent service and location was perfect. Have been in New Orleans numerous times so we didnt need to be in the heart of French Quarter which could be very noisy. dont get me wrong, love a good time let the good times roll but when I want to sleep I prefer quite.. Staff very helpful , great new restaurants in warehouse district....Thank you for the great review and for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We certainly appreciate the kind words and we are looking forward to hosting your next trip to the Big Easy!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
I will never consider staying at the Whitney after my epic night of uncomfortable room temperatures and a night's sleep on the hardest, cheapest mattress I've every experienced. The hotel staff was nonexistent and are complaints were only listened to AFTER check-out.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit. Sincerely,Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The hotel was alright, this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same, rude staff, bugs in room, room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday, our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable, you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday, declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task, a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property, even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and, at the time, confirmed by you. We thank you for giving us another opportunity. We sincerely hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans. As always, if we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Recently stayed at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. The hotel was an exceptional experience from the old 1910 building to the amazing queen suite. We would make any future visits to New Orleans included a stay at the Whitney Hotel. Front desk staff helpful, friendly and very informational about locations in the city. Parking was somewhat priced out there but the valet service took good care of our truck and promptly brought it to us when we called for it. Would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to experience New Orleans in actual history and ambience.Thank you for the great review and for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel! We'll pass along your kind comments to the staff and look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral ManagerCasey.CallaisWhitneyHotel.com
Unfortunately, it is not a place to have confidence. One of my children left a small amount of money in the car. When we left the hotel we realized they had stolen it. Although it was little amount of money, the fact is equally repudiable.Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your recent visit and will use the information you provided here to enable additional training and exceed future expectations. Please accept my apologies for not doing so during this visit. I hope you'll consider giving us another opportunity to make a better impression during your next visit. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with my 13 month old son and our experience was disappointing from the moment we checked in. When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear we didn't meet your needs initially with the crib. We've found that most prefer a soft-side crib over the steel framed ones. Once your requests were understood, though, our desk agents promptly retrieved a crib that was to your liking. We truly do appreciate your feedback and will use to provide better experiences. Thank you. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
What a wonderful weekend spent with my husband. Staff, Food, Rooms, everything was great. So welcoming and professional from arriving to departure. Location is perfect. Not to busy, but many thing within walking distance to explore in the big city. Defiantly will be back soon... Wouldn't stay anywhere else! Thank you for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel. We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and look forward to hosting your next trip to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This was a beautiful hotel. All the things that made it a bank are still there, reminding you of the lovely banks that we used to have. The fact that part of the building is still an operating bank was a surprise. Everything was lovely. I did not eat in the restaurant because the rest of my party wanted to go other places , but we should have eaten there. We went to Mother's we had the worst meal that any of us ever had. I would highly recommend this hotel for a great stay its location.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and we appreciate the great review. We look forward to hosting your next stay, feel free to contact us for future reservations.Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. However, the hotel itself seemed to be a hodgepodge of various updates through the years. It seems staff has been trained to blame it on Katrina but when you stay its clear that the owner has not sufficiently maintained the facility through the years and when maintenance was performed, done so at the cheapest cost no matter how unsightly. the hotel has a lot of potential but is not a boutique by any stretch of the imagination. the windows are original so they are thin. curtains did not properly open and close. AC was loud and inconsistent at keeping a steady temp. using an old mercury thermostat. continental breakfast was paltry compared to others hotels.Dear Josephcarter2018,Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I apologize that your stay fell short of our high service standards. We truly consider all feedback to be a critical part of our success. We pride ourselves on the high levels of service provided to our guests and I am very sorry to hear that was not the case during your stay. Your honest feedback is greatly important to us as we continue working to make improvements and please rest assured that your comments have been heard and passed along to senior management. Thank you again and I truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to visit again in the future.
My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Whitney Hotel. We chose it for its mid-way location between the WWII and the Ogden Art Museums, and the French Quarter. It is also only a block from the Charles St. trolley to the Garden District.Our 6th floor king-bed room was a little small by king standards, but didn't feel cramped. The only smallness inconvenience was a lack of night stand and light on one side of the bed (no room). The bed and pillows were excellent and the room clean. The bath room had ample space for both of our toiletry bags, and there was a nice tub/shower with great towels. The provided shampoo and other products were of high quality.Since our room was directly above Poydras Street, a busy thoroughfare, we expected some noise and on the first night, which coincided with a Saints NFL game, we got it. However the noise subsided about 10 PM after the game traffic cleared and each of the subsequent nights were pleasantly quiet. The A/C was efficient and quiet.This is a smaller hotel (compared with the mammoth nearby Sheraton) and the staff were always available and pleasant. There is a restaurant on the premises (we only had one breakfast there - very good) but many, many fine restaurants in all price ranges are within 5-10 min walking distance. I felt the hotel was a great value for the price and would gladly stay again.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! Thank you for the great review and we look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We booked this hotel as it offered close proximity to the the centre of New Orleans and it offered disabled facilities in 'superior' rooms. We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that. If there is further information you would like me to review, please don't hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Special birthday trip for 5 days. We narrowed our choices on Hotels.com to finally choose The Whitney. We stay at many 'upscale' hotels in our business travels, and wanted an 'experience'. Location - perfect, a couple of blocks to the French Quarter, 3 or 4 to the Riverwalk, great food nearby. Starting with Earl (the Pearl) checking us in, and Michelle (long brown hair) made us feel comfortable far beyond the typical experience. They were knowledgeable and available for any of our needs wants, as other staff including housekeeping, they are great!Cleanliness rates a 10+Southern Hospitality 10+We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit to the New Orleans and thank you for staying at the Whitney Hotel.

The Hotel is within easy distance of both the French Quarter and the Warehouse district. This is a historic building built as a bank and office use, so rooms may be smaller than a normal hotel, but the building has character. The staff was 5 star by being attentive, friendly, and helpful. My room was very clean and comfortable. I will stay again.Thomas W, Thank you so much for the wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel and sharing your feedback with others on TripAdvisor! We greatly appreciate your comments and cant express to you our gratitude for your kind words about our hotel and our colleagues. I am very glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us! Thank you for the terrific review and for recognizing our great team for taking care of you. Thank you Again Thomas W.
We have stayed at The Whitney before, but had no idea that the hotel no longer had a bar nor restaurant. This is a sad commentary, since we enjoyed the hotel last year, and were looking forward to another visit. The staff was again cooperative, understanding, and friendly. But, the sink had only a trickle for water flow, and the engineer could not fix the problem. And, we were there for 5 ngts. I'm sorry to hear you did not enjoy your stay. There were some service issues with the previous food and beverage operation, which was contracted through a 3rd party. Due to this, a change was made and the hotel has started offering a free continental breakfast. While we've received mostly positive feedback about the change, we understand that some like a full service restaurant inside the hotel. Plans to reopen the bar are underway and with all the wonderful dining options in walking distance of the Hotel, our Front Desk team will always have a great recommendation for you. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope you come back and see us next year. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager

We enjoyed this lovely hotel. It was nice to go to breakfast and look up and see the beautiful architectural details. The bank vault of course was extraordinary. We learned that the hotel is still attached to a working bank. The restaurant was lovely and the bacon egg and cheese croissant was fresh and delicious. The room was nice enough and clean enough. We would definitely stay here again for a quick stay.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans!

The Whitney is about five blocks or so from Canal and on to the bars and restaurants of the French Quarter. At night it is a quiet walk past hotels and office buildings once you cross canal returning home. The staff is very friendly in that way New Orleans is. There is a small restaurant for breakfast and coffee if it is raining outside. Rooms are nice and quiet. Would definitely stay again.Thank you for this wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel.

For my mother's 90th birthday, she wanted to go to New Orleans (has not been since 1959) and we had a fabulous time. My thanks to the Whitney for making her feel so special, absolutely everyone at the hotel was gracious, helpful, polite and fun. The hotel was completely booked, but our spacious rooms/bathrooms were cleaned promptly and it was not noisy. I highly recommend the Whitney Hotel for the perfect stay in New Orleans...Cathy ThomasNashville, TNWe're so pleased to hear you enjoyed your trip to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and thank you for the kind words.

When my original room was not ready, staff upgraded me to suite, which was great, with one exception. Given the historic nature of the property, electrical outlets were not readily accessible. The location was great for the purpose of my trip. Everywhere I needed to go was w/in a block.Thank you for your recent visit and the great feedback you've left here at TripAdvisor. We look forward to seeing you again!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Managerccallaiswyndham.com
The bar closed at 10pm which was poorOnly 3 days into our 8 day trip we were told the bar and Resturant were closed leaving us with no facilities in the hotel We should have been told that when we were booking and would not have booked it as it's nice to eat and drink in the hotel after a long days walking around town Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations. The restaurant was a third party operation, not owned or managed by the Hotel and the decision to close the venue could not be controlled by the Hotel. To offset any inconvenience, the Hotel offered, free of charge, a grab and go continental breakfast. Please accept our apologies for the closure. If you feel there is any other information I need regarding your stay, please feel free to email me or call me on my direct line at 504-212-8686. Again, please accept my apologies and thank you for letting me know about your visit.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this Hotel. The room was clean, quiet for sleeping and comfortable. Very convenient for transportation and access to popular locations. I did not use the restaurant facilities, I think there could be a little more promotion for the dining room. Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans!
