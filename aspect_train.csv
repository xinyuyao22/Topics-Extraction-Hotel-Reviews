The other thing...[and I feel awful having to say this because nobody else has] ...is that breakfast was a little uncomfortable [ bit too intimate! ],['OTHER']
as we had to keep sharing a table with someone because the room was so tiny [ a converted cellar I think] and there was a maximum number of tables- so if everyone came down at once in the morning it would be chaos!!!,['BUILDING']
The lady waitress was a bit slow on the uptake and didnt understand much of what we were saying but we just didnt let it get to us.Nevertheless this hotel is good value for money and I agree with most of the comments made and the manager has done his best to make sure nobody has a bad time.,"['SERVICE', 'VALUE']"

This was not the case and we were charged $13 a day for the privelege.,['VALUE']
During our time in the States we had stayed at other more basic hotels which offered free wifi in rooms.,['OTHER']

"I had spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 on Las Ramblas before checking in to the CF, and although a night in a Standard room at the CF was 110 Euro a night more expensive than a Superior room at the 1898, the CF truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money.I should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of Euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the CF for the weekend of November 17th, but I ended up having to change my travel dates due to work.",['VALUE']
"Obviously, it would have been great to get the cheaper rate, but I would pay the higher rate again for a chance to stay at the Casa Fuster where the service and the accommodations are truly top notch.","['OTHER', 'SERVICE']"

"Of course, the first thing I noticed as I was walking back up Pasaig de Gracia towards the hotel was a Large grey tour-bus parked outside the hotel.",['OTHER']
"Still, this lobby was crowded in the way I enjoy so I cannot fault it Although I expected the Standard room at the CF to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the CF had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the Hotel de Russie in Rome.",['ROOMS']
You could comfortably fit two people in this bathroom which I appreciated even though I was traveling alone.,['ROOMS']
I did have a minor problem with the shower 鈥?,['ROOMS']
Thankfully when I returned to my room the attendants who had done turn-down service had replaced my wet towels with fresh ones.,['SERVICE']

Guess you cant have the crowded lobby without the obligatory tour bus parked outside.,['NOTRELATED']

The later was on the pricey side but no more than I expected to pay at such a fine hotel.,['VALUE']
