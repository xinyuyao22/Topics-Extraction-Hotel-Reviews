This hotel was nice and quiet. Did not know, there was train track near by. But it was only few train passed during our stay. Best Western changed hotel classification. The Plus category are not the same as before.
We stayed in the king suite with the separation between the bedroom and the living space. The sofa bed wasn't very good I had back discomfort by the day we left on our three night stay. The room is clean, and the king bed very comfortable. This hotel is located within walking distance to most places you will want to... More
Parking was horrible, somebody ran into my rental car while staying there. I didn't get to try the breakfast, I was there for business so the restaurant opened to late for the business world to enjoy, I had to asked for coffee for my room, And the items in the vending machine were stale.
Not cheap but excellent location. Price is somewhat standard for not hacing reservations. But room was nice and clean. They offer good continental breakfast which is a plus and compensates. Front desk service and personnel where excellent. It is Carmel, no A/C in rooms but they have a fan for air circulation.
If you get the room that they advertised on the website and for what you paid, you may be lucky.If you stay many days , they will give you the not so good rooms.Nobody wants to stay in these rooms: low light/dark rooms, near pool, noisy, smelly bathrooms, or difficult access. If you stay one-two days you will get probably... More
This is such a fun, lovely hotel. The attention to detail is impressive, from the thicker rimmed water glasses to the extra fluffy towels. Loved the vibrant art which lends itself to a hip vibe. My only disappointment was at their restaurant, the Lockbox. The menu is just trying too hard. I am a fairly adventurous eater but each of... More
We recently stayed at this hotel on a trip to Lexington with other friends. Our group shared the feeling that we would not be back. We routinely waited more than 10 minutes for elevators. The workout room is tiny with 2 treadmills and 2 cheap elliptical machines that rocked off the floor when in use. Everything about the hotel seemed... More

This is a new Hampton Inn and is well decorated. The color scheme gives a feeling of luxury and is very restful. The beds are comfortable and the black out curtains keep the room dark for a good nights sleep. The entrance is a little difficult to find so look closely for the sign. The staff was very friendly and... More
I stayed here for three nights while I explored nearby Santa Barbara. This place is ok for a night or two, if you can live the excess noise coming from the freeway, then three nights is just about doable
Completely accommodating hotel! I booked a reservation last minute day of, used points to offset the cost and even called the front desk to ask for a little help. They were completely kind and welcoming, especially accommodating while under construction. Thank you!
The water is very hot and there's no cold water at all... It's awful.. The food is not good.. The staff is friendly and very nice.. More upscale items should be offered for the price of the room at 200. A night! Snacks, toiletries, menus and food and drinks offered.. Promote your business... I'm sorry to hear we didn't exceed your expectations but thank you for bringing these issues to our attention. We take your feedback seriously and will share it with the staff. I hope we'll get another opportunity to make a better impression when you return to New Orleans. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss your stay further. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Great staff and rooms. Housekeeping was always spot on--we never saw them come in, and it was in perfect order when we came back to our rooms. The hotel is close to everything, French Quarter, museums, business district, etc. And we got a GREAT price for our stay. It's an excellent value--highly recommend to anyone visiting New Orleans!
This Hotel, formerly a prestigious bank, may be attractive for history buffs, but is an expensive and horrible place to stay when you visit New Orleans. The rooms are SMALL, unattractive, with terrible old bedding, virtually without windows or amenities. Parking was 38/day, and it took 35 min. to get your vehicle. Almost no lobby or sitting area, the restaurant was small, understaffed, with a severely limited menu. The commode was crammed into a tiny bathroom, and we had to call down to get them to bring up an old beat-up refrigerator. There are SO Many other more attractive places to stay in New Orleans, less expensive, I would avoid this place like the plague.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit. Sincerely,Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Very accommodating staff. Competitive pricing for downtown N.O. convenient location. Comfortable room. Good food in restaurant. Broken exercise equipment. 'fitness club' is a bit of a misnomer. We can recommend this to anyone else for a good place to stay with great location for many attractions.Thank you very much for your comments about your most recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel! We are working on getting updated exercise equipment and I'm sorry it wasn't ready for you by the time you arrived. I am happy to hear that you had such an enjoyable stay overall and we hope to see you again the next time you come to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Room was much larger than I expected, and water and fridge were offered for my room - had everything I needed. Nice basic breakfast was included. Room was very clean and everyone here was friendly! Would stay again. We're thrilled to hear you had a great New Orleans experience at the Whitney Hotel. Thank you for mentioning the breakfast and the cleanliness of the rooms. Our staff strives for excellence and I'm glad to see that was provided. We hope to see you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The Whitney Hotel is ideally located to see most of the sights of New Orleans. I would say it is a place to lay your head but I found the restaurant poor in terms of food choice and quality. The room phone did not work, no room service offered and the room can be noisy as it overlooks a major road. Overall, I think we can do better on my next trip to New Orleans.Thank you mentioning how you enjoyed the location and cleanliness of the Hotel, I'll pass that information along. I'm sorry to hear about the telephone and will have Engineering test the line. On behalf of the Management of the restaurant, please accept my apologies. I'll make sure they get a copy of this review. Thank you again for your candid comments and we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. If we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This is an old hotel in very good location. A 5 minute walk to Bourbon Street and Harrahs' Casino. A 15 min walk will get you to Caffe DuMonde and the French Market. Although old, the hotel is well kept and the staff is efficient. I found the room a little bit small, but confortable.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A.

The hotel is historic and yet modern. Full of history. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Orleans. Blocks from the French Quater and the Riverfront. The staff was very courtis and very knowledgeable. Always there to help get you where you want to be. Just one block to Mothers one of the local best restaurants. Totally enjoyed my stay On behalf of the staff at the Whitney Hotel, thank you so much for your recent visit and for the wonderful review. We'll share your praise with our staff and sincerely hope we'll get to see you again soon. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This hotel aptly named the Whitney Hotel as it was the location of the Whitney Bank.Several of the features of the bank era are there to be seen such as the strong room doors and related features.This hotel is in a very good location very close to local transportation - buses and streetcars.A short walk takes you to many places to eat, drink and shop.Less than ten minutes walk to Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street.Pleasant ambience, friendly staff and comfortable rooms. We had a noisy air con and after underlining our concerns were moved to another room and provided with free on the house breakfast.The hotel has partnership with some eating/licensed businesses plus a two for one offer for Mardi Gras World.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A.

We recently had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans and we chose to stay at the Whitney based on user reviews, location, and price. The room was very nice and was really clean. The hotel was well decorated. The one big call out I have is that the restaurant accepts room charges and cash only! As a rule, I won't support a business that doesn't accept credit cards for payment. Valet parking or a paid lot across the street are your parking options.Thank you for recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and for your kind comments. I'll be sure to pass this along to the staff. Please let us know if you need any reservation assistance in the future. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Our room was beautiful, the location was wonderful just a couple of blocks from shopping, Bourbon Street and an easy walk to Jackson Square. There are great restaurants in walking distance as well as the restaurant in the hotel. Dinner in the vault was fabulous.The service was outstanding.Even one of the maintenance men held doors for me and gave great advice on where to eat. Loved it and can't wait to go back. Thanks especially to Jason who really took great care of us.We appreciate your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and are so happy to hear you enjoy your stay! We'll pass along your kind comments to the staff and we look forward to hosting your next New Orleans trip! Feel free to call the hotel directly for any travel needs. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Excellent service and location was perfect. Have been in New Orleans numerous times so we didnt need to be in the heart of French Quarter which could be very noisy. dont get me wrong, love a good time let the good times roll but when I want to sleep I prefer quite.. Staff very helpful , great new restaurants in warehouse district....Thank you for the great review and for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We certainly appreciate the kind words and we are looking forward to hosting your next trip to the Big Easy!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
I will never consider staying at the Whitney after my epic night of uncomfortable room temperatures and a night's sleep on the hardest, cheapest mattress I've every experienced. The hotel staff was nonexistent and are complaints were only listened to AFTER check-out.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit. Sincerely,Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The hotel was alright, this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same, rude staff, bugs in room, room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday, our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable, you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday, declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task, a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property, even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and, at the time, confirmed by you. We thank you for giving us another opportunity. We sincerely hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans. As always, if we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Managercasey.callaiswhitneyHotel.com

Recently stayed at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. The hotel was an exceptional experience from the old 1910 building to the amazing queen suite. We would make any future visits to New Orleans included a stay at the Whitney Hotel. Front desk staff helpful, friendly and very informational about locations in the city. Parking was somewhat priced out there but the valet service took good care of our truck and promptly brought it to us when we called for it. Would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to experience New Orleans in actual history and ambience.Thank you for the great review and for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel! We'll pass along your kind comments to the staff and look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral ManagerCasey.CallaisWhitneyHotel.com
Unfortunately, it is not a place to have confidence. One of my children left a small amount of money in the car. When we left the hotel we realized they had stolen it. Although it was little amount of money, the fact is equally repudiable.Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your recent visit and will use the information you provided here to enable additional training and exceed future expectations. Please accept my apologies for not doing so during this visit. I hope you'll consider giving us another opportunity to make a better impression during your next visit. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with my 13 month old son and our experience was disappointing from the moment we checked in. When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear we didn't meet your needs initially with the crib. We've found that most prefer a soft-side crib over the steel framed ones. Once your requests were understood, though, our desk agents promptly retrieved a crib that was to your liking. We truly do appreciate your feedback and will use to provide better experiences. Thank you. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
What a wonderful weekend spent with my husband. Staff, Food, Rooms, everything was great. So welcoming and professional from arriving to departure. Location is perfect. Not to busy, but many thing within walking distance to explore in the big city. Defiantly will be back soon... Wouldn't stay anywhere else! Thank you for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel. We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and look forward to hosting your next trip to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This was a beautiful hotel. All the things that made it a bank are still there, reminding you of the lovely banks that we used to have. The fact that part of the building is still an operating bank was a surprise. Everything was lovely. I did not eat in the restaurant because the rest of my party wanted to go other places , but we should have eaten there. We went to Mother's we had the worst meal that any of us ever had. I would highly recommend this hotel for a great stay its location.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and we appreciate the great review. We look forward to hosting your next stay, feel free to contact us for future reservations.Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. However, the hotel itself seemed to be a hodgepodge of various updates through the years. It seems staff has been trained to blame it on Katrina but when you stay its clear that the owner has not sufficiently maintained the facility through the years and when maintenance was performed, done so at the cheapest cost no matter how unsightly. the hotel has a lot of potential but is not a boutique by any stretch of the imagination. the windows are original so they are thin. curtains did not properly open and close. AC was loud and inconsistent at keeping a steady temp. using an old mercury thermostat. continental breakfast was paltry compared to others hotels.Dear Josephcarter2018,Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I apologize that your stay fell short of our high service standards. We truly consider all feedback to be a critical part of our success. We pride ourselves on the high levels of service provided to our guests and I am very sorry to hear that was not the case during your stay. Your honest feedback is greatly important to us as we continue working to make improvements and please rest assured that your comments have been heard and passed along to senior management. Thank you again and I truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to visit again in the future.
My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Whitney Hotel. We chose it for its mid-way location between the WWII and the Ogden Art Museums, and the French Quarter. It is also only a block from the Charles St. trolley to the Garden District.Our 6th floor king-bed room was a little small by king standards, but didn't feel cramped. The only smallness inconvenience was a lack of night stand and light on one side of the bed (no room). The bed and pillows were excellent and the room clean. The bath room had ample space for both of our toiletry bags, and there was a nice tub/shower with great towels. The provided shampoo and other products were of high quality.Since our room was directly above Poydras Street, a busy thoroughfare, we expected some noise and on the first night, which coincided with a Saints NFL game, we got it. However the noise subsided about 10 PM after the game traffic cleared and each of the subsequent nights were pleasantly quiet. The A/C was efficient and quiet.This is a smaller hotel (compared with the mammoth nearby Sheraton) and the staff were always available and pleasant. There is a restaurant on the premises (we only had one breakfast there - very good) but many, many fine restaurants in all price ranges are within 5-10 min walking distance. I felt the hotel was a great value for the price and would gladly stay again.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! Thank you for the great review and we look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We booked this hotel as it offered close proximity to the the centre of New Orleans and it offered disabled facilities in 'superior' rooms. We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that. If there is further information you would like me to review, please don't hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Special birthday trip for 5 days. We narrowed our choices on Hotels.com to finally choose The Whitney. We stay at many 'upscale' hotels in our business travels, and wanted an 'experience'. Location - perfect, a couple of blocks to the French Quarter, 3 or 4 to the Riverwalk, great food nearby. Starting with Earl (the Pearl) checking us in, and Michelle (long brown hair) made us feel comfortable far beyond the typical experience. They were knowledgeable and available for any of our needs wants, as other staff including housekeeping, they are great!Cleanliness rates a 10+Southern Hospitality 10+We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit to the New Orleans and thank you for staying at the Whitney Hotel.

We look forward to hosting your next visit to the Big Easy!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral ManagerCasey.CallaisWhitneyHotel.com
The Hotel is within easy distance of both the French Quarter and the Warehouse district. This is a historic building built as a bank and office use, so rooms may be smaller than a normal hotel, but the building has character. The staff was 5 star by being attentive, friendly, and helpful. My room was very clean and comfortable. I will stay again.Thomas W, Thank you so much for the wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel and sharing your feedback with others on TripAdvisor! We greatly appreciate your comments and cant express to you our gratitude for your kind words about our hotel and our colleagues. I am very glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us! Thank you for the terrific review and for recognizing our great team for taking care of you. Thank you Again Thomas W.
We have stayed at The Whitney before, but had no idea that the hotel no longer had a bar nor restaurant. This is a sad commentary, since we enjoyed the hotel last year, and were looking forward to another visit. The staff was again cooperative, understanding, and friendly. But, the sink had only a trickle for water flow, and the engineer could not fix the problem. And, we were there for 5 ngts. I'm sorry to hear you did not enjoy your stay. There were some service issues with the previous food and beverage operation, which was contracted through a 3rd party. Due to this, a change was made and the hotel has started offering a free continental breakfast. While we've received mostly positive feedback about the change, we understand that some like a full service restaurant inside the hotel. Plans to reopen the bar are underway and with all the wonderful dining options in walking distance of the Hotel, our Front Desk team will always have a great recommendation for you. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope you come back and see us next year. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager

We enjoyed this lovely hotel. It was nice to go to breakfast and look up and see the beautiful architectural details. The bank vault of course was extraordinary. We learned that the hotel is still attached to a working bank. The restaurant was lovely and the bacon egg and cheese croissant was fresh and delicious. The room was nice enough and clean enough. We would definitely stay here again for a quick stay.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We greatly appreciate your kind words and look forward to hosting you again soon. If we can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us directly. Sincerely, Casey A.

The Whitney is about five blocks or so from Canal and on to the bars and restaurants of the French Quarter. At night it is a quiet walk past hotels and office buildings once you cross canal returning home. The staff is very friendly in that way New Orleans is. There is a small restaurant for breakfast and coffee if it is raining outside. Rooms are nice and quiet. Would definitely stay again.Thank you for this wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel.

For my mother's 90th birthday, she wanted to go to New Orleans (has not been since 1959) and we had a fabulous time. My thanks to the Whitney for making her feel so special, absolutely everyone at the hotel was gracious, helpful, polite and fun. The hotel was completely booked, but our spacious rooms/bathrooms were cleaned promptly and it was not noisy. I highly recommend the Whitney Hotel for the perfect stay in New Orleans...Cathy ThomasNashville, TNWe're so pleased to hear you enjoyed your trip to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and thank you for the kind words.

When my original room was not ready, staff upgraded me to suite, which was great, with one exception. Given the historic nature of the property, electrical outlets were not readily accessible. The location was great for the purpose of my trip. Everywhere I needed to go was w/in a block.Thank you for your recent visit and the great feedback you've left here at TripAdvisor. We look forward to seeing you again!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Managerccallaiswyndham.com
The bar closed at 10pm which was poorOnly 3 days into our 8 day trip we were told the bar and Resturant were closed leaving us with no facilities in the hotel We should have been told that when we were booking and would not have booked it as it's nice to eat and drink in the hotel after a long days walking around town Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations. The restaurant was a third party operation, not owned or managed by the Hotel and the decision to close the venue could not be controlled by the Hotel. To offset any inconvenience, the Hotel offered, free of charge, a grab and go continental breakfast. Please accept our apologies for the closure. If you feel there is any other information I need regarding your stay, please feel free to email me or call me on my direct line at 504-212-8686. Again, please accept my apologies and thank you for letting me know about your visit.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this Hotel. The room was clean, quiet for sleeping and comfortable. Very convenient for transportation and access to popular locations. I did not use the restaurant facilities, I think there could be a little more promotion for the dining room. Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A.

I was in town for the Crescent City Classic. The Whitney Hotel is easy walking distance to the start of the 10K race. Also close to the French Quarter and the WWII museum. I like the Central Business District and this location is very central for my purposes, with St. Charles street car close by to the Quarter and the Garden District. Very good value compared to comparable hotels. I have stayed here twice before and will try to stay here again my next trip. Was a good hotel for me.We're so happy to have loyal guests such as yourself coming back again and again to the Whitney Hotel! Thank you for your continued patronage and the wonderful review. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Hotel is older but quite nice. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are well appointed and quite modern. There is a bit of traffic noise from the street (I was on the 3rd floor) but this is to be expected downtown in a major city. (plus I was there the day the St. Patrick's day parade occurred, and its route took it right by the corner of the hotel). I didn't use the restaurant but it looked very decent. It's quite close to the various things to do or a quick cab ride away if you don't want to walk. I would certainly stay there again.Thank you for the great review and for your visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! It certainly was a pleasure hosting your stay. If we can be of any other assistance in the future, please let us know. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Stayed for one night. Hotel is in a great location to walk to Superdome for Saints game and have dinner at the great Restaurants in the warehouse district. Hotel is clean and quiet. Loved how the lobby and check in area still have the large safe and bank windows throughout. Thank you for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We're happy to hear you enjoyed your visit and appreciate the great review! We look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We stayed 1 night. while the hotel was beautiful and the staff were pleasant,I inquired about extra charges to my card, no one knew why. I then emailed twice and called again (international as I was on my honeymoon) with no response!!! How frustrating to know so much was charged without a reason why or enteraction from staff!I am very sorry to hear about what has happened during and after your stay with us.

Stay at The Whitney to capture a sense of the history of New Orleans with its actual bank vault door decor, and location that is right in the heart of New Orleans great for business but close to the French Quarter for fun. It's clean, comfortable, has amenities, and is a great location, friendly too.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Overall, good trip. Clean and friendly! It was mid summer when we stayed and we prefer ice cold room. Couldn't get it cool enough. Bed was comfy. Pillows a bit too thick for us. Cold water at faucet was warm to hot. Shower temp was perfectly hot. Would recommend more mirrors in room. A safe would be good addition and fridge. Enjoyed continental breakfast. Would stay at this beautiful hotel again. Thank you for the great review and your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We certainly appreciate you kind words and will pass them on the staff. It's our pleasure to provide excellent customer service to our guests. We look forward to hosting you again in the very near future. Sincerely, Jason LaBicheGuest Service Manager
Our recent stay at the Whitney was overwhelmingly nice. The hotel is housed in the historic old Whitney Bank Building. The reception desk was once the teller desk and the old vault is located in the lobby. Our suite was very large with two rooms. The master bedroom was quite spacious and was separated from the sitting area by French doors. The sitting area had a sofa bed it's own television. The bathroom was also very spacious. The hotel offers free internet as well as complimentary coffee. There is a restaurant located in the lobby. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel is located right off of Saint Charles Avenue which is very convenient during Mardi Gras and only a half a mile from the French Quarter. I will be staying again!!!On behalf of the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans, thank you for your visit and kind words on TripAdvisor. We hope we'll get another opportunity to serve you again during your next trip to the Big Easy!Kindest Regards, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
I have stayed at the Whitney many times for business, back when it was a Wyndham property and now that it is a New Orleans Collection Hotel. Staff is friendly and efficient, rooms are clean. At some point soon they will need to address carpet as it is getting dated, but OK now. Bar downstairs is good as is restaurant. We ate breakfast a couple of times at Cafe on the Square around the corner and had good experiences.Thank you for your continued patronage at the Whitney Hotel. We are in the planning stages now for replacing carpet throughout the hotel. Thank you again and we look forward to hosting your next visit to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Whitney. The beds were very comfortable. The location is superb. It is walking distance to everything we did, French Quarter, Bourbon Street, shopping, Harrah's, etc. We will definitely stay here during our next trip to New Orleans. The staff was rather gracious as well. Loved it!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write a review regarding your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Super friendly and accommodating staff. Staff bent over backwards to assure we had a great stay. Always ice cold water, news papers and vacation information in the lobby. Great restaurant recommendations. We ubered from the airport 33-55 . You do not need a car in the city. Street car on one side of hotel. 2 blocks to French quarter and bourbon street. Near casino and ww2 museum. Beds super comfortable and hotel is really clean. Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We greatly appreciate your kind words and look forward to hosting you again soon. If we can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us directly. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We enjoyed the hotel. Location was great walking distance to many sites. Paying to park was a surprise, but we decided that was better than staying further away and worrying about parking.Hotel was absolutely beautiful. Very nicely maintained. No old hotel odor. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was nice, very comfortable kept very clean by friendly housekeeping staff. Lovely city view. Traffic noise was noticeable. Bathroom was good sized, had a great shower, and was nicely kept. Restaurant was beautiful. Food adequate but not exceptional. Limited hours. Service friendly but I actually got up to get my own coffee refills one morning even though only two tables had customers. Overall a great experience and we would definitely stay again and recommend it to others.Thank you for your recent visit. We appreciate your feedback and look forward to hosting your next stay at the Whitney Hotel!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager

I found this hotel online, and it came highly recommended. It was convenient to everywhere in the city I wanted to go, though its location on Poydras street did mean the mornings were a little noisier than I expected due to the traffic, but you can't fault them for that. I had occasional difficulty with my room key working but still always got into my room. I didn't realize at booking that the hotel doesn't have a bar/restaurant and the room didn't have a refrigerator but that was my fault for not checking. Overall the staff was incredibly helpful, friendly, and made my stay. The hotel is very unique and original due to its history and not like every out-of-the-box hotel you find these days. It was nice to stay in a place with such character. Res877, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us at The Whitney Hotel. We are delighted to know that you enjoyed your stay and thank you for pointing out the amazing service you received from our staff.

We had a wonderful stay at the Whitney hotel. The front desk staff headed by Patrick were the best that I have ever experienced. They were extremely helpful in making reservations at great restaurants, guided us through the craziness of Mardi Gras and were always friendly and helpful in every way. The rates were a good value and the location was ideal.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. Thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review and for mentioning the wonderful service Patrick provided. I'll be sure to let him know.

Room was very clean and well appointed. Everything you need for an extended stay. Bed was very comfy. Front desk was extremely accommodating. I had a very late check-in due to another engagement and there was no issue. Highly recommend.
We were at the Club Pulse for just one night. Everything was perfect, staff at the front desk were very friendly and knowledgeable, everyone we ran into was professional and nice, the room was super comfy. We had a suite with a kitchenette (microwave, refrig with freezer unit, coffee maker, dishes, flatware, glasses for water and wine), 2 televisions - one in the bedroom the other in the living room. The seating was very comfortable and a table to eat. I highly recommend this property. We were in town to see the play Hamilton, we were easily able to walk to the Gas Lamp for dinner and then to the Civic Theater.Thank you for a perfect review! We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay and look forward to welcoming you back again sometime.
My wife and I stayed this past weekend at the Marriott Pulse. Nice hotel with great amenities. Good location in downtown San Diego. Only 4 blocks to the gaslamp district with many choices of restaurants in the area. 1 bedroom unit is a little small compared to other Vacation Club properties so would be tight if 4 are staying in one of these units.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
We ended our San Diego stay here, with 4 nights. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was comfortable, and, surprisingly, the pull out sofa bed was the most comfortable I have slept on. The fitness center was clean, and had a good variety of equipment. The parking fee is steep, but standard for a large city. Good luck going around the spiral getting in and out of the garage. Easy access to everywhere we needed to go.
accused of smoking in my room. only young black kids in the hotel. ima 24 year old well put together chef. needed time away with my girlfriend. Managers and loss prevention kept harassing us. Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about, but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones. You service was so bad , and biased my girlfriend told me not to complain about the towels or buy from your marketplace. This is going to get solved in a court matter. This was the worst experience i have had at a hotel and i travel frequently.
Stayed here September 2018 for 7 nights hotel was amazing and should be rated a 5 star plus everything was perfect fantastic rooms amazing staff first class facilities great location close to all local attractions would highly recommend.Our team appreciates your review and recommendation on TripAdvisor. We are happy you enjoyed your visit to the resort and look forward to welcoming you back again in the near future.
My wife and I stayed here with our 2 grandchildren for 5 days in April. The room amenities are very nice with very comfortable bedding and living area. The Kitchen area is small, however, with a small mini refrigerator and microwave so if you are planning to eat many meals in your room, this is not the hotel for that. We walked to Little Italy, the Gas Lamp area, PETCO Park and to the USS Midway. Very convenient to all locations. They have Valet parking and a restaurant on property although we did not use it. They also have a fitness area and a indoor pool.Steve, thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you and your family enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego. We hope you will visit us again sometime.
This place was recently renovated and our room on the 23th floor felt like we were staying in a hi-end condo with breathtaking views of San Diego bay and the Coronado bridge. Sleek and modern decor with marble countertops stood out to me. There were two flat screen TV's, and a fully-stocked mini kitchen with fridge. Located right in the middle of downtown minutes away from the gas lamp district this place is prime location. The luxurious amenities combined with meticulous customer service especially in the downstairs restaurant makes for a memorable experience that I wouldn't hesitate to highly reccommend over and over again! Great job Marriott!Charles, thank you for a perfect review. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego. We hope you will visit us again sometime.
The issues started the first night. Do Not stay in room 1501. Although the room seems like it is a bit away from the elevators the bed room is right next to the elevator shaft. This would be fine if it was just elevator noise but every time it went up and down the banged like the someone was knocking on the door loudly. All night all day whenever someone was in the elevator. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy, Jared. He said that Otis elevator was actually on site fixing the elevators. They actually came to room but could not figure out where the noise was coming from. I did mention it again on Wednesday but they did not do anything. They could have at least moved me to another room. On Friday I was supposed to meet someone for dinner. I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit, unfortunately right when he called at 630. He tried again at 7. The staff did not leave a message on my room phone (or my cell/email which they had). At 9 I received a call from the front desk that I received 2 calls at 630 and 7. When I asked why I am just hearing about it at 9, the woman said the note got lost and they had just found it. Oh did I say the pool was closed. Lastly, 1501 is a joined room and on Friday night, at 11 a family decided to have a fight where someone was slapped and the mother and little daughter started crying. I called the office but as far as I know no one came up or called. Just not a good stay. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review.

I stayed at the Marriott Vacation Club Pulse during Memorial Day weekend from the Bay Area. Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage. The hotel staff took me to my room in a wheelchair and brought me ice and other items to assist with my pain. On top of that, they gave me a Get Well card signed by all the staff. The room is nice (not too big and not too small) and the furniture is well appointed. The bathroom is a really great size with the closets located inside the restroom along the wall (nice touch). Before I arrived I read the reviews where other travelers complained about a reflection on the sliding door that separates the living room from the bedroom at night. I did not experience that. I enjoyed the indoor pool/jacuzzi and the close proximity to the Donut Bar (the donuts are splendid), the House of Blues, as well as other restaurants, banks and stores. The street it is located on is more quaint than lively, but you're a stone's throw away from the action. The room service is great ( I ordered breakfast a couple of mornings) as well and the delivery team makes sure you're satisfied. They also have a discount card avail (not sure it's available to all traveler profiles) that you can use at nearby restaurants which was a plus. I really enjoyed this property which I will definitely book when I return to the San Diego area.Thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
This is a really modern hotel bang, smack in the centre of the great city of San Diego, California. And because it has most of anything you need at pretty high quality, it is not cheap. We stayed for two days and enjoyed both beertasting and whiskey/whiskytasting for only 5 each. The bartenders, John and Ben, did a fine job! Breakfast is not included, but it's not very expensive and you have lots of choices. We didn't try the restaurant. They served us good hashbrowns and perfect eggs which were impressively fast on our table. Good selection of teas and real freshly squeezed orangejuice. Staff looks happy, not just polite. Great room, loved the chocolate! Fine beds, fridge and microwave in the livingroom and tv both there and in the bedroom. Modern fascilities for charging phones etc. Even if you need an extra plug, it's already there. Any niggles Well, parking in cities may be difficult, but 42 per night with valet and 35 without seems to me a bit over the top, the room comes at a price so it ought to be half the price for guests. After all, just a few blocks up you could park for free on the street. But will I stay there again if in SD Yes, of course.Thank you for your review and for taking the time to let us know about your stay! We are happy you had a great visit to the resort and look forward to more vacationgreatness with your family.
Stayed here for one night and really enjoyed it. The place is very modern and is being upgraded. The staff couldn't have been any nicer. Great bar with pretty good bar food.The bar tenders were super. Place was very clean. The only problem is you're a little removed from the action but a short Uber/Lyft ride and you're there.Worth going back to next time I'm in San DIegoThank you for your review. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
My husband has business here and I tagged along. What a fantastic hotel. The service is impeccable. When we checked in I had bruised my wrist, freak accident. My husband asked for an ice pad. They gave us 2 ice pads and was so concern. We checked into our awesome and perfect suite, not 5 minutes. We heard a knock on the door. Anthony, security management, was at the door with a note of well wishes for me plus a box of gourmet cookies. We were just blown away how fabulous his concern was for us as their guests. We can't say enough how awesome the service is for this hotel. Highly recommended. Wish I could give it a 6 stars. :)Thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
We got a couple of connecting suites, very confortable and with all the necesary ammenities. Stayed there for a week. Contemporary and stylish.What we liked the most was the location right in the middle of down town where there is a good array of restaurants, its close to the Glass Lamp area and to the trolley.Service was very kind at all times. The food was ok but for some reason lacking a bit in salt to our latino taste buds. But the coffee great. Restaurant open at all times which is practical.One thing that should be handled is the dirty windows from the outside. That takes away from the aesthetics.I definitely give it a thumbs up because its a good value for the money.It sounds like the perfect vacation at Marriott Vacation Club Pulse! Thanks for sharing and we look forward to more vacationgreatness with your family.
Beautiful modern king city view suite. A few quirks like 12th floor check in and directions needed to leave. Staff was very nice and helpful 40 per night off site valet parking but it was pretty quick. Walking distance to Gaslight district. Close to waterfront and airport. Overall great value Thank you for your review. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
If you are driving then this is for you! A bit of walk to tram and facilities.It's an old style hotel with bigger rooms that's a plus, however I would definitely check out the location next time! Breakfast selection is not a great option, it certainly a reasonable feed!Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to complete the Guest Satisfaction Survey in regards to your recent stay at the Four Points by Sheraton San Diego - SeaWorld.

First impression, I see vehicles parked tightly not only on the curved street immediately in front of this Four Points, but continuing as tight on the front end of this Four Points Hotel property up, with only a small passageway past their shuttle, to the hotel entrance. Never have I seen vehicles parked at this concentration at the front of any hotel before! Upon entering the Hotel, I see a very new hotel look and like what I see. I wait but a few minutes and then am assigned a room. Room 127, first floor. I checked in at about 9:30 PM Saturday night and that was what was available, but requested an upper floor room, if available, the following night. Duly noted.First room impression. Beautiful room so far. How do the lights work Not the usual toggle switch. No hint from the front desk about simple light operations, at all. Onward into the dark room until I get the lights on. No master switch. Every light has its own switch. Bathroom has three. Awesome bathroom with glass doors.First night room impression. HVAC works well. Not too loud. People walking down, and talking loudly, the hallway can be heard clearly ! People running or walking upstairs sound loudly. Slamming doors on every room are very loud inside my room. Screaming or running children are not silent! The sound of dripping water from from an upper level HVAC unit sound like tapping on my window tap most of the night long. Second night impression. Moved upstairs to Room 226. No more frequent travelers headed for upper levels. Same drip drip drip sound from an upper level HVAC unit dripping on my window frame, or HVAC frame. Only on screaming child in the hall about 7:30AM.The desk personnel were very simple and personal. They helped me move a room request. Parking impression. Ugly. Animal like. You gotta be kidding me. This is a Sheraton Hotel! Owners, take a look. This is not a dog race arena parking lot!Sheraton alert! Sheraton alert! Sheraton alert!Good day Gregory N,Thank you for this very detailed feedback and for choosing our hotel. We are happy to hear you were pleased with the appearance of our newly renovated property. In an effort to ensure our operations are environmentally friendly, we have equipped all our guest rooms with motion activated lighting that can also easily be adjusted manually. We are very sorry our team was not proactive in its explanation of the guest room light functionality and operation. We are also sorry to hear of the challenges you encountered with the noise level during your stay. We have shared this valuable feedback with our team and taken the necessary steps to rectify your concerns. We wish you the best and hope to see you again very soon.Thank you,JGFront Office Manager
The area was just off a busy freeway in what we described as the stripper neighborhood. I needed early checkin which I arranged months ago. Didn't get it. When we were able to check in noticed wet section if carpet. Thought maybe they cleaned something up. Next morning 1/4 room saturated. Went to front desk. They said probably Ac problem. They said no problem to fix. We left. 6 hours later returned problem not fixed and water is traveling. Went to front desk. They said something like this can't be fixed in a day. What did you expect Odd, I expected it fixed. Can you at least suck up the water No, we can't. Hmmmmm. You will get a new room. I said no, fix it. Our time is limited and on way out soon. They said they'd send someone to look at it. Twenty minutes in the bar (nice bar and staff) went up to room. Maintenance had it fixed in 5 minutes. They placed towels on floor where they stayed until we left. Thank you for your feedback. I apologize that we were unable to fix your air conditioning issue immediately. Through our several interactions with you early in the day, you were offered a room move several times until we could get the resources to fix the leak in your air conditioning. I am sorry that the staff that you spoke with were not more empathetic, but they did offer you alternate accommodations. We try to honor early check in requests, but that is dependent on the departure patterns and how quickly we can clean the rooms for the new arrivals. I hope that this does not prohibit you from joining us again.
This Sheraton hotel is very good. The rooms are very big and very clean. Air conditioner works excellent and it's a strong point. The service and people are the perfect. Parking lot avaiable and free. My suggestion is for breakfest, could bring more option of fruits. Just it, but it's very good.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to review the Four Points Sea World. we are happy to hear you really enjoyed the hotel. We hope to see you back in the near future.Sincerely,LBGeneral Manager
We really enjoyed our stay at the Four Points. The hotel is well furnished, clean, and comfortable. The bathroom is generously sized and updated.I enjoyed the stair access in the lobby so that I didn't have to take the elevator constantly. Our door did not close all the way - we just had to make sure we pulled it completely closed.My only criticism was the toiletries in the shower and the shower handle are poorly placed. I hit my elbow a few times and the toiletries caddy makes it hard to wash your hair under the shower.Hello,Well first of all I want to Thank you for staying with us at Four Points Sea World. We appreciate you taking the time to write a review, not to mention the very nice comments. Your feedback about the amenity caddy is much appreciated, I will have that looked into. We hope to see you back some time soon.Thank you,LBGeneral Manager
I used this hotel for an event we were having and Heather Gordon was amazing! She helped me coordinate 30 rooms and make sure that everybody had what they needed. The location was perfect since it was close enough to Gaslamp and Petco Park. Everyone enjoyed their stay and I enjoyed how easy it was to coordinate accommodations for 30 people. Thank you Heather and Sheraton!Hello,Thank you for the nice compliments, especialy about Heather. We think she's great as well. We appreciate you choosing the Four Points Sea World and for taking the time to write a review for us.Thank you once again.LBGeneral Manager
I stayed here for one night with my wife and two little kids. We were given a corner room with two queen beds which provided more than enough space for us. We were able to fit the toddler bed into the bathroom like we usually do. I chose this place in spite of the 15 parking fee, no free breakfast, and close proximity to a strip club (as mentioned in prior reviews). The room was clean and spacious. The highlight for me was the amazing bed and pillows. I stay at many different hotels and if this is the standard for Four Points I am very impressed. We also ate at the Denny's right across the street and went to Sea World the next morning refreshed and ready.
This comfortable , well appointed hotel turned out to be a very good choice for my short stay in San Diego. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet and early evening 'Happy Hours' were unexpected surprises. Casual dining at the bar or at the tables near the pool was ideal. The free wifi was appreciated but I was a little disappointed that the courtesy shuttle to and from the airport has been discontinued. The hotel is only a 15 min walk from the delights of the San Diego Old Town. The Transit Centre offers a choice of bus or Trolley downtown, or a no 30 bus for the 30 minute ride to La Jolla. A day pass covering both buses and trolleys is great value. With the distances between attractions in San Diego cab rides can be expensive.Good day Ronald S,We are so happy to hear you felt welcome in our home and we would like to thank you so very much for sharing your experience.

The hotel staff was friendly and engaging. The property appeared recently renovated and well kept up. You need to be prepared for the surrounding neighborhood. it's 100 feet from some of the sketchiest places you ever want to see. Not one but two strip clubs, a couple of adult bookstores and of course, the obligatory massage parlor beneath the bails bondsman. None of this is the hotels fault and I would certainly rate them higher if the neighborhood was a little nicer.Good day Carver123,Thank you for sharing your experience with our team. We are glad you found our team to be friendly and engaging. We are sorry to hear of your challenges with the surrounding area. While there is little our team can do to improve the surrounding area, we are certainly empathetic to your concerns and appreciate your feedback. We hope to see you again very soon. Thank youJGFront Office Manager
Having recently spent 45 days at this Hotel, and having been there for an extended stay prior to this trip, I feel uniquely qualified to write this review. First, I found the Staff to be extremely friendly, helpful and professional, always quick to respond to my requests and needs. Being a single, older woman, I was delighted to feel safe and secure during my stay. The room was clean and the appearance pleasing, the bed was very comfortable, and breakfast in the mornings was always good. In the late afternoon, it was fun having 'Happy Hour' with great prices on wine and a light food selection. I appreciated that there are washers and dryers located on each floor. The Hotel is near all of San Diego's most sought after sites, shopping, Old Town and it's a breeze to jump on freeways to go anyplace. I will most certainly be staying at the Four Points again.Hello,Thank you first of all for staying with us. The staff really enjoyed having you here and they were sad to see you go. I am so happy to hear you were so well cared for. I will definitely pass on the nice compliments to the staff.Thank you once again.LBGeneral Manager
I had a friend in town, so was looking for a San Diego hotel, but everything downtown/Gaslamp etc was over 300, so we decided to give this a try at 199 .. It was OK .. the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, but the walls are thin, and sounded like a herd of elephants in the room above us, early in the morning. I would suggest a higher-floor room, we were on the first floor. But, I can't say anything about the elevator situation. Don't see us needing to stay in SD again anytime soon, and there is really nothing about this property that beckons me back. Exiting the hotel parking area is hazardous, there are cars flying off the freeway, so you have to time your exit carefully!Hello,Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review the hotel. Happy to hear you enjoyed the room. Sorry for th issue with the noise.Sincerely,LBGeneral Manager
Well checked in was given room 183 couldnt stand the odor for more then 5 seconds.went to desk got a different room 153 was much better but still odor of mildew and mold.was given free breakfast which was ok.i wouldn't recommend to anyone unless i wanted to know what they thought of the place.Thank you for staying with us. We see that you have given us a rating of 1/5. With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are sorry to hear that we have not met your expectations. As a valued guest, your feedback will be shared with the team to continue to inspire and motivate them to deliver exceptional customer service. We sincerely appreciate your feedback.
The A/C unit under the window blows air directly on the bed. I like it cold when I sleep but in order to have the A/C on when I sleep it blows a wind chill on me in bed. I had to move yhe room chair in front of the A/C to block the air flow.
We really enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn Mission Valley. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. We especially enjoyed the wonderful complimentary breakfast every morning. There is also a pool, hot tub and fire pit. We will definitely stay here again!
This is a pretty new property that is conveniently located to Seaworld, downtown, and La Jolla. Staff was mostly polite, especially the breakfast staff. The room was clean. I liked the shower enclosure in the bathroom and the electronics charging station on the nightstand. The mattress was a bit firm for my taste. The only thing missing is a microwave in the room. Parking is 16/day, which is questionable. Breakfast was adequate--continental-type items, plus waffles, oatmeal, breakfast potatoes, eggs.Good Afternoon pe556ai,Thank you for your five star review, we are glad you had an excellent stay! We were thrilled to read that you enjoyed our central location, amenities, and your interactions with our team. Thank you for noting your preference for a microwave in the room. We understand the convenience this provides and do have some available for a nominal fee per night. On your next stay with us, we would be happy to note that preference to ensure your complete comfort. Thank you again for staying with us it was a privilege to have you as our guest.Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
The hotel is ok but considering you pay 19 a day for parking it should be better. There aren't many normal parking spots. You frequently end up in a parking structure in the back and walking stairs to reach your car. Breakfast is as expected at any similar property. Very busy on the weekend. And no matter how busy it is at 10am the doors will be locked. We were done but several people missed out. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Housekeeping pounded on our door and brought us towels at night we didn't ask for and when we told the front desk they acted like it was our fault for not refusing the towels.
I have to say that I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The customer service was excellent, the staff friendly and attended to my needs with a prompt response. Breakfast was also very good, rooms clean and overall appearance of the facility was impressive to say the least. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to San Diego. Thank you for the recommendation! We recently opened the hotel in July with the latest Hampton Inn design. We're pleased that our Team was able to accommodate your needs during your stay. We hope that we'll be your first choice should you return to the San Diego/Hotel Circle area.
We enjoy a lot our stay, I went whit my family and it was perfect. We ate a delicious breakfast ande the bed, the bathroom, the quiet was awesome. My family and I love Hampton Inn and in this opportunity it was the best.
The hotel is clean and the staff was excellent. There is no shuttle service but you can Uber for pretty cheap. The airport is only about 10 minutes away. The 18 a night for parking is absolutely ridiculous!! The hotel is close to most of the San Diego attractions including old town San Diego.
Very good hotel with easy access. Parking can be tight for 14/night when coming back late at night but there is room in the back. Surprised at the quality of the breakfast - get there early - and the pool area. Staff was very good.Good morning! Thank you for the valuable feedback. We're thrilled to see that you enjoyed our convenient, central location in San Diego our complimentary deluxe continental breakfast buffet. We hope to see you again soon!
Stayed here for a week (Sat. to Sat.) while visiting San Diego. The hotel was clean and free breakfast was great. The hotel seemed to be newer as evident by the modern decor.For those traveling with small children, our room only had a shower. Our 2 yr. old has only taken baths so he had to quickly get used to a shower, which did not end up being too bad for us. Location is excellent as you are 10 minutes from Sea World, Zoo, Balboa Park, USS Midway and much more. Parking is usually 16 a night but when we checked in they gave it to us for 10 a night! We rented a Hyundai Elantra and anything bigger would have been a pain to park as spaces seem very tight. This was not only at the hotel, but pretty much anywhere we parked in San Diego.
Likely the fanciest Hampton I have ever stayed in. Very large property, very modern and clean with a huge common area off the lobby. I think this Hampton may have the most awesome breakfast buffet in terms of size I have ever seen, and I have stayed at a LOT of Hamptons. Triple waffle iron area with 4 times the variety of toppings... say wahIn all seriousness, the rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The entire property was. The front desk staff was super friendly and welcoming. It felt like an upscale Hampton here.Now, they lost one star for two reasons - parking, they charge. To me it is insane to charge a customer for parking unless you are MAYBE downtown where I get parking is a commodity. This is Hotel Circle for crying out loud and they charge 18 bucks a day which is ridiculous. I have status with Hilton so they did lower my parking to 10 per day but it was still annoying and felt like they were simply trying to generate more revenue... particularly due to there was PLENTY of parking. The other reason was the housekeeping. We were there four nights and I had to call for housekeeping to come clean up my room. My husband had spilled a little something on the sheets and I was very surprised that they did not flip out the bottom sheet. Nope, left the stain there which was kind of gross. When they finally did clean, it was a half-hearted job, no toiletry or coffee refills, half the towels, etc. The front desk always came through for me though so it was not that big of a deal in the bigger scheme of things.
The location of the hotel was central to all of the surrounding attractions. We definitely loved the beautiful weather. The staff was very nice and were willing to help or assist when needed. I will definitely be back.
This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are quite nice. The large was extremely comfortable, but there were a few issues I experienced: - The hallways smelled of dirty wet dog. - There were outlets for charging on only one side of the King bed. - I expected liquid soap in the bathroom and shower as I've had at the last two Hamptons I've stayed at. - There is a hotel being demolished on one side of the hotel, so the construction noises started fairly early. - The breakfast buffet was extremely sub-par. The paper plates and plastic utensils were just tacky and I expected more from a Hampton. The food options were lacking, the fruit was not fresh, the eggs had an odd flavor, there were no breakfast meats at all, and the self-serve coffee was empty and when I politely alerted a staff member, I was basically ignored.Dear Will L,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us. At the Hampton Inn San Diego Mission Valley, we want our guests to have the best stay possible, one where everything exceeds their expectations. I want to personally apologize that this was not the case for your stay with us. We are humbled by your feedback, but thank you for providing us with the opportunity grow and improve as a hotel and team.

I hope to hear from you soon.Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
- Great Hotel and Staff - Perfect location - Right off the Freeway, close to all restaurants, 7 mins away from OLD town, 10 minutes from downtown, 15 from the beach. - Free Breakfast is a must - Very Friendly staff on the floor and kitchen.Dear Gaganjot S,Thank you for your five star review. We appreciate you recognizing our great team and making note of our prime location. Thank you again for your feedback and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
Location is easy to get to and even though the room is small it met our needs.Staff is very friendly and helpful in assisting any requests we had.Room was in need of a carpet vacuum - which was not done during the 3 days we were there.Good afternoon! Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate your comments and will use your feedback to make improvements to the services we provide. We truly enjoyed hosting you in our Boardroom and look forward to welcoming you back the next time you're in San Diego!
Best hotel ever. Right by mission bay beach. Rooms are beautiful extremely clean. Parking could be larger but manageable. Definitely a 4 star hotel n Hampton is always a pleaser to stay at while on vacation.
super friendly staff, average breakfast, free wifi, 16.00 per night parking, good AC in room, good bedding, average cleanliness, lots of kids, family hotel no good restaurants close by...easy freeway access better than most hotels on the circle
Excellent service.. Very welcoming staff. Always smiling and willing to assist in any way. I traveled without my husband and took my three sons and a friend of there's and we all survived the stay without any casualties Dear anacU7065VB,Thank you for your 5-star review! I am thrilled to read that our team delivered an exceptional experience and can't wait to share your kind words with them. Thank you for staying with us and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
Stayed at this Hampton with my family for College Tour at UCSD and SDSU. It's a great location, very centrally located to the colleges, downtown, restaurants and beaches. It located on what's called Hotel Circle. I will definitely stay there again next time in SD. Room was very clean and everything works as it should. Free WiFi could be faster speed but that's minor.
I was traveling to see my son graduate from Marine boot camp and I couldnt be more pleased with the friendly and helpful service I received from ALL the staff. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful with activity tips, dining, shopping etc.
This hotel is wonderful: friendly, helpful staff, very clean, nice decor with a good feel. Parking lot is easy in and out with plenty of parking close to the doors. The breakfast is as good as they always are at Hampton Inn's. There's something for everyone. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying the breakfast with as many choices as there are. I always appreciate the 24 hour coffee/tea station and little convenience store with everything you might need without having to leave the hotel. Rooms are super clean, quiet, and comfy!
We will use this hotel again. Great location. Right off freeway. All places we wanted to go were within 5 miles. Comfy bed. I thought pillows too flat (soft), but still slept well. While we were there it was pretty quiet. Our room faced a hotel that is being dismantled. My husband was awakened once by noise that was from there, but it was only for a few minutes. I wasn't disturbed by it. I would suggest asking for a room that did not face that way, especially if you are a light sleeper. The hotel and our room quite clean. From the reviews I read, I think the hotel is less than 2 years old. They have free wifi. Parking is 16 a day/night. There was plenty of parking. We stayed 8/23-8/26 (Sun-Thurs). During busier weekends or holidays not sure of parking situation or how quiet it would be. The breakfast is fantastic and staff kept all items stocked to 10am when the doors were closed. Many choices. Examples: Scrabbles eggs, sausage links, sausage patties, ham, gravy, biscuits, omelets, home style brkfst potatoes/hash brown dish, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, variety of fruit, muffins, bagels and breads (toast it yourself), make your own waffles, 4-5 different dry cereals, variety of yogurt cups, variety of coffee, tea, oj, apple juice, milk. Variety of jellies, cream cheese, creamers, sweeteners, peanut butter, honey, syrup, butter, margarine, etc. Every day we were there all the hot items were different. The hot egg, meat, potato dishes listed above were not all one day. There were four different items daily of the eggs, meat, and potato dishes. I figured at least 10-15 per person savings if we had to buy breakfast somewhere. All hotel staff very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the Old Town Trolley Tour. Check out all details on line. According to information, the trolley picks up at the hotel. We did not get that early of a start to be picked up at the hotel. Not sure when or where return would be for the trolley. For the times and things we did, it worked out better for us to park at Midway and get on trolley at that location.Dear Pam O,Thank you for your 5-star review. We were thrilled to read that you enjoyed our central location and the great attractions that surround us. Additionally, we graciously appreciate you recognizing our friendly and helpful team. As for your description of your breakfast experience, the only word that comes to mind is wow. Thank you for painting such an amazing picture, our breakfast team was ecstatic. I cannot begin to describe the smiles you brought to their faces when they read your review thank you very much for making their day that much better!Last, but certainly not least, thank you for leaving a traveler tip. While we work to create world class experiences every day for our loyal guests, nobody lives the experience quite like you, our guests. Thank you for helping us make our future guests stays exceptional!Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
We had a great experience here. For the money, you can't beat Hampton Inn Mission Valley. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast is the best I've had (and I stay at many hotels), and the rooms are clean and modern. The temperature is easy to control, and there were extra blankets in the closet. We got daily housekeeping service and they did a great job. There is a pool and hot tub, as well as a fire pit. The pool is smaller than it appears in the picture, but it was never overly crowded and my sons had a blast playing in it every night. The town is a short Uber ride away. There are two washers and dryers for guest use, but sometimes there is a wait. I would definitely stay again.
The most important thing to us is the cleanliness of the hotel, and especially the room. We did not worry about anything as it was fresh and clean every day. The staff was all friendly at all times of the day. We arrived earlier than our check in time but our room was ready so that was good too.Thank you Dolores for taking the time to review our hotel. Our housekeeping staff takes pride in the cleanliness of each room. We are delighted to see that we've exceeded your expectations that our staff had an opportunity to make a great connection with you! We hope that we'll be your first choice the next time you visit San Diego!!!
Besides Henry, the front desk employees and maid service was above and beyond expectation. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to this part of the U.S. The driving around the area was a bit difficult, however, the front desk took great care of giving excellent directions.Thank you for recognizing our staff's Hamptonality. We're thrilled to share your comments with them and give Henry a spot on for his exceptional service. We hope welcome you back soon!
We chose this particular hotel because we had stayed in it last October '14. This time we brought our entire family to have a week long family celebration of our 50th wedding anniversary. The staff, for the most part, is different. But, even better than last time which was right after the grand opening. I'm telling you. You won't be disappointed. They really are a first class operation, kind, and considerate, especially to us older folks that need special handling.
Nice hotel. Easy check in and clean room. Slight deltas: hotel phone handset was sticky (would have never had touched it but the front desk left a welcome message). Shower water pressure was low. The desk chair was uncomfortable, seat pad was very thin. Sometimes road noise was notable. These minor issues were easily overcome/overlooked.
Was greeted with a courteous staff. The room was clean and quiet. Breakfast was good, although a bit crowded at times. My only issue is the parking fee of 19... way too much! Similar properties less than a mile away did not have a parking fee.
Nice place, but.........21 to park!Wifi would drop out, every 5 minutes. Frustrating.Shower pressure sucked. Really bad.Pillows were pretty flat.Lots of freeway noise.Breakfast on Saturday morning was a zoo. Overcrowded, dirty tables, no one cleaning them, out of juice, out of eggs, pretty much out of everything. Get there early. We went down at 0930.Probably would choose someplace else when returning.
Very Hilton-y. I know what to expect. Good service. Updated rooms. Good amenities. When you travel a lot... consistency is fantastic and unpleasant surprises can be draining. Gold+ members get a great breakfast included. Super convenient to shopping, business and restaurants.
The Hampton Inn (Mission Valley) in San Diego was a great choice for our family weekend getaway. It was close to the freeway as well as the San Diego Zoo, parks, and other attractions. The rooms were clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good - not great, but acceptable.
HI. everything was very nice. free wifi and free breakfast. the parking was not free though. the pool was warm and hot tub. there was not really any view but there was a good restaurant in the area named hunter steak house.Thank you for writing a review of our hotel. We glad to see that you've enjoyed the many amenities we have to offer including complimentary wifi, breakfast buffet, pool/spa/fire-pit. We hope that we'll be your first choice the next time you return to the San Diego area!
Hotel is in a great location for 5he purpose o my trip. Staff was very accommodating. Check in and check ou5 wa extremely easy. Internet work well, food was good, room was clean and quiet. Will stay here again if Im in San Diego
I stayed in this hotel with a group of 50 high school students. The staff was friendly, organized, and made the check-in process super easy, considering the size of my group. The were accommodating to all of our needs, even setting up a section of bus parking for us. The staff was also respectful to my students, which is not always the case. Many times hotels only address the adults, but Robbie took it upon himself to make sure they were comfortable.
If you like King rooms, be prepared not to have a bath. None of their King rooms have baths, only showers. I could not properly wash my hair with a tiny showerhead. Many King rooms have communicating doors to the next room, which are good noise-carriers. With regard to noise: the rooms at the freeway end of the hotel are very noisy, much more so than other hotels we've stayed in on Hotel Circle South. We were living out of our suitcases because of the ridiculous size of the drawers in the room (basically the size of nightstand drawers - see picture). The pool is the size of a large hot-tub. Breakfast had many items but lacked quality: the only good things we found were yoghurt and fresh fruit, cooked food was poor.Hotel staff were helpful and did their best to resolve our issues in a not-so-great hotel. Next San Diego visit: back to the Doubletree.
Everything about this newer hotel was pretty nice. Two big detriments: 14 to park, which is ridiculous for a Hampton Inn. Really!! And the bathroom doors have automatic closers, which is terribly annoying, especially when you have little children with you. When I commented to the front desk clerk on checkout what a hassle this was, she said, Yeah. I know. It's a problem we're trying to work on, but with 182 rooms, it takes a lot to do all of them. I said, Well, you should at least provide a doorstop in the room. Her reply was, Oh, you could have asked for one. We have them here. Well, why on earth isn't there a notice to that effect in the room We could have avoided a lot of misery. Anyway, the staff was very nice. The breakfast was very good. We didn't have an opportunity to use the outdoor/pool area, but it looked very inviting with a nice lounge/conversation area. We'd probably stay here again, but we'd definitely ask for a doorstop if they haven't fixed the doors yet. (And we might try to strike a deal with the restaurant next door to park for less.)Dear Traveler, Thank you for reviewing our hotel. The comments are insightful and helpful for the hotel teams goals to improve the service and guest experience. Please accept our teams sincere apology for the failures in service that resulted in any inconvenience and lack of comfort. We are grateful for the choice you made to be a guest of the hotel. As you know, we are currently working towards a solution that meets both safety standards and guest comfort for the bathroom doors. We will continue striving to provide a hospitality level that exceeds other available lodging choices and hope that you'll give us another opportunity should you return to the San Diego area.
Wonderful staff! Everyone was so nice, as well as helpful. Great location too! I have stayed at this hotel several times, and it's always been a great experience. It was fun to see the hotel decorated for the holidays. Thank you! Dear Guest. I appreciate your positive feedback about our hotel. We do take pride in catering to our guests' needs the best way we can. If you're traveling to our area again soon, don't hesitate to call us.All the best,Jordan MauckFront Office Manager
This hotel is located in old town very close to airport. But San Diego airport and center of the city are very close to each other, so its very convenient. I could stay here with calm condition after my business and go to conversation center within 15 minutes by Uber. Im also very satisfied with courteous staffs.
Great value, nice location. Easy access from San Diego airport, short drive to downtown and convention center area at a more reasonable price. Also enjoyed proximity to old town for restaurants and bars. Great area to stay and a clean, quiet, comfortable hotel.
When we arrived, the exterior of the hotel was very colorful and set the tone for a relaxing stay. Christian and Lyle at the front desk were very welcoming. They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service. The only drawbacks were you had to pay for nightly parking and the computers were very slow and the printer was not working. The rooms were clean and updated.
We stayed from Wednesday to Friday in December 2017. Reservation was made on line. I also had a Friends Family Discount Voucher. Front Desk Rep would not accept it. Stated that the reservation was not made that way Explain Pls Just repeated what was said earlier. The reservations was made correctly with the Corporate Code. All I had to do was present Voucher upon check in Spoke to the Operations Director the next day. She couldn't do it either. And stated you got a good rate anyway I would have gotten a lower rate if they honored it and would have proven that the Corporate programs works. Oh well...Next issue parking fee of 20/night. Other Marriot Hotels waive the fee if you are a Calif. AAA member. Brought it up and was told: we don't do that here Ok, I can accept that. However, parking on property is underground and VERY LIMITED. If you drive in and no spaces, you need to back up all the way out. Had to park on the street both nights (which would have been FREE). Other than that, the room was clean and spacious enough. Closet space was small but adequate for the length of stay. I like the pull out desk/table. The shower soap was smallL. Could not get a good grasp on it. It was not larger than 2 flash drives end-to-end and just a little bit wider. That's it. I kept dropping it. The Bistro/Starbucks in the lobby was not open at 6 AM as posted so no eats if you need to hit the road early...
The Courtyard San Diego Old Town is my new favorite hotel! The location is perfect - within easy walking distance (a few blocks) of the amazing restaurants and shops in Old Town. The front desk staff are very hospitable and eager to assist. The property is beautiful and the decor is true to the area. I enjoyed my stay here tremendously!Jjhoster Thank you so much for taking the time to let us now how your stay was. Glad we were able to wow you and allow us to become your new home away from home. Can't wait to have you back, thanks again!!
Only staying overnight for easy airport access for early morning flight. My business reason is always TJ and this Marriott works for my departures and keeps my rewards points coming. I plan to keep using unless a problem starts happening that cannot be fixed by Marriott management.Greetings Lairdc266,Thank you so much for the review regarding your visit. I am glad to hear that our location is so convenient for your travels to Tijuana. We look forward to seeing you next time!All the best,Jordan MauckFront Office Manager
Our reservations were made the day before we traveled. Arrived around 9:00 at night, staff very friendly and ready to help. Room was clean and ready. There was no iron in the room, staff immediately brought one to the room. Room was cleaned daily, nothing went missing. Hotel is right next to the freeway. The room was quiet and traffic noise wasn't a problem.
Average place , over priced and they charge you to park your car onsite.Stayed in far nicer motels for less .Small rooms. Dirty windows .I would expect more from a larger chain like this. Beds were average , bathrooms small but ok.Dear mrshibariplay,We recognize your time is valuable and appreciate the feedback you have provided us regarding your most recent stay.. Maintaining a fresh atmosphere within our guest rooms and common areas is always a key priority. On behalf of the entire team at Courtyard San Diego Old Town, I sincerely apologize for falling short of not only meeting your expectations, but ours as well. Rest assured, the feedback provided will be shared with the appropriate hotel team to ensure we consistently deliver upon guest expectations. As a valued customer thank you for choosing us to accommodate you during your travels. We hope to see you again whenever your travels bring you back to San Diego!
Overall very nice property with friendly staff and good parking options. Walking distance to Old Town San Diego that has an abundance of restaurant choices, stores, and sites. The hotel is also very close to the airport (less than 5 minutes) and a short drive to numerous nearby attractions.Greetings Cypressman,I appreciate your positive feedback about our hotel. We do take pride in catering to our guests' needs the best way we can. If you're traveling to our area again soon, don't hesitate to call us.All the Best!Jordan MauckFront Office Manager
Very convenient to the airport. Clean rooms. Friendly staff but a bit off on their directions to restaurants in Old Towne. Pizza flyer under the door so someone wondering the halls was not a great feeling. Could use a bit of updating. Had a glass of wine in the lobby area and the service was friendly and entertaining.
The hotel is really nice the restaurants have a great food and the staff is excellent. The location makes it easy to get to anywhere been in downtown San Diego and the area is located with several nice restaurants to choose from . The staff...More
Stayed here for 4 nights in Nov and absolutely loved it! Great rooms, great staff, great location (right in Gas Lamp area), great bar and restaurant. Will definitely stay here again when I'm back in San Diego (soon, hopefully). A lovely place to come back...MoreDear Dean L, Thank you very much for your complimentary review after your recent stay at the Omni San Diego Hotel. We were delighted to learn you enjoyed your visit and would consider returning in the future. I agree that our team of service professionals...More
I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around.
I enjoyed my stay here. This hotel is exactly what you would expect based on the price. The Good great location that is within 10 minutes to all (zoo, seaworld, petco, jolla, beaches), nice pool and hot tub area, ample parking spots (just not after 12 as expected), and reasonable price. The Bad not the most plush bed but exactly what I expected. If you're looking for location + price, this is the place for you
The hotel is nice, the location is good, and the staff has been nice BUT it is infested with little cockroaches and they are every where! It is disgusting! I would recommend spending a little more money for a hotel that won't have you sleeping and going home with nasty bugs! Thank for your recent review. We are happy to you thought the hotel and hotel staff were nice. We appreciate that you have brought this area of concern to our attention. Rest assured, each guestroom is routinely deep cleaned and treated with commercial grade steamers as a preventative measure.

The hotel is located next to a very noisy highway. The bathroom was very dirty and the room cooling/heating unit was very noisy. I was not made aware that there was a breakfast included so I could at least enjoy something from this hotel. I checked out after the first night of a 2 night stay and went to the Hilton Bayfront for almost the same money and a MUCH BETTER experience.Dear Bernard B,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we appreciate your feedback. We are sorry you had some noise issues and concerns with your room and if you had let the front desk know, we would have done our best to move you to a more quiet room and address your concerns. Our on-site restaurant, Seven Seas Caf serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
the restaurant was overpriced and not very good. The wall of mirrors in the rooms is awkward when you are sharing a room with your mother, although I think it would have been weird if it had been my husband and I too. The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room, for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or, because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room, which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp, and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working. I will be letting the Marine admins that recommend this hotel to visiting families about this stay.
We arrived at this hotel a little early for check in so we went to get some essentials from the supermarket. We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone.
We stayed overnight in San Diego on our roadtrip. The Best Western is nice, cleen, there was a huge room with two queen size beds. There was free wifi and a refrigerator. We had a quite room on the ground floor.
I took my almost 13 year old niece to San Diego. We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable. There is a plug issue with two outlets where refrig, blow dryer and coffee maker plug in. It wasn't too much of an issue because we just unplugged the refrig when we briefly needed the other appliances. Mirrors didn't bother us and they do make the room feel larger. Room was very clean, bedding was clean and of fairly good guality. Probably the biggest negative was thin walls and doors that you could not close quietly. So we heard noise above us and we were bolted awake one morning by a neighbor 's slamming door at 6:30am. Plenty of free parking. beautiful grounds, sparkling clean pool, nice jacuzzi and great location. Hotel shuttle driver was very nice and reception crew was always helpful. I also appreciated the free computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes. I would stay at this hotel on another trip to San Diego.
Due to LOSSAN performing track maintenance, I wound up spending a few days in San Diego. When I saw the rate, I grabbed it because, honestly, I was curious.What really makes this hotel good is the staff. That goes double with the staff at the restaurant who really stood out and made the place great.The room was good, but not great. It did, however get the job done and I was well rested and got some work done. Under the right circumstances, I would stay again.Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego and for being our guest! We truly appreciate your kind words in regards to your recent stay at our hotel. We will be sharing your nice comments with our Staff members. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego!
I chose this hotel because it was close to the venue where I went to a concert, and I thought a Best Western would be nice. It was not worth the price I paid. Besides not providing breakfast or a discount coupon for breakfast at the adjoining restaurant, the room was small, the towels felt like sandpaper, and the list of television stations was incomplete.
I have had the pleasure to stay here on business and with my family on our weekend getaways! As always, the staff are professional, polite and very helpful to ensure my/our stay is the best possible. I am scheduled to return at the end of the month,.Thank you for being our guest and continually choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your hotel accommodations in San Diego. We are honored to hear you always enjoy your stays with us whether its for business or leisure. We are also extremely pleased to hear that our staff goes above and beyond to ensure you stays with us are great. We cant wait to welcome you back. Thank you!
Stayed at the Seven Seas for three nights en route to Los Angeles and San Francisco, yes it could do with updating but you get what you pay for. Hotels near to the city centre are much more expensive and it only cost 9 dollars in an uber to the harbour plus the bus terminus is only ten minutes walk with frequent travel to the centre. Our stay was comfortable and the staff helpful and polite, no problems with the room It was clean and roomy and you also have free on site parking which is a bonus. A couple of small swimming pools if you would like a relaxing dip and well kept gardens throughout the location. On site restaurant and bar which we didn't use as we were out early and back late. Easy to find just off the freeway would definitely stay again when visiting the area.
I was pleasantly surprised and how nice the property is with a nice jungle type of setting for the landscaping. Very lush/green areas and the rooms are very comfortable and basic. It's a good value if you book early enough to get a good deal for this pretty place. They also have a good cafe/restaurant next door you can have... More
Although the Best Western is aesthetically pleasing upon arrival, the staff in the main lobby are less than hospitable. Even though the hotel has Wi-Fi, the staff did not go out of their way to offer the code to me at check-in. The room was impeccably clean and attractive. However, the bed was not very comfortable to sleep on.
I had a three day seminar, down the road, under the bridge and across the street. It was a pleasure to spend half the money and still be in walking distance of the seminar. The room was small but definitely workable. The grounds were beautiful and it was a pleasure to walk through there every morning and each evening. The staff were cheerful and helpful.
The Best Western Seven Seas was very convenient, easy on and off freeway access. It is only a short distance to the airport parking. We had pre-paid for our room and upon arrival found out that our room had been up graded at no additional charge. Had a king size bed with a balcony and had only paid for queen size bed. pleasant surprise.
This Hotel does not give you a welcoming feel, the staff is not friendly the rooms smell, beds are not comfortable. I stayed in a BW in North Hollywood the same week and it had breakfast and did not smell very nice. Thank you for your review regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, we would like to apologize for not exceeding with your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and Staff for specific training purposes, as guest satisfaction and meeting their expectations are quite important to us. We hope that you will consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Thank you!
we checked in around 8pm room air conditioner was not turned on room had an odor ref was unplugged we had to figure out where the socket was cant dry your hair and keep ref plugged at the same time no microwave in room or convenient place to use it in lobby
We were thrilled to find availability at this hotel, as we booked it the week before our trip. Most hotels were sold out in the area, so we were pleasantly surprised to find comfortable, clean, and hospitable accommodations. We loved the location, which was within a couple miles of Old Town San Diego. If we ever need to return, I will definitely book this hotel.October, 30. 2015Dear Maria Elena We thank you for choosing Best Western Seven Seas for your recent hotel accommodations. We are delighted to know we met your expectations at a busy time of year and that you enjoyed staying in our clean, comfortable guestrooms. We thank you for your feedback, guest satisfaction is always important to us. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego here at the Best Western Seven Seas.Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
This is a 1960's era resort motel, a bit out dated but comfortable and reasonably priced, convenient and with free parking. The old in room air conditioner did it's best, still struggling along as it continues to age. Front desk service was just average. TV reception was minimal we did need to have maintenance come in to get it connected. In room coffee tea is absolute minimum.
We were 4 women in a room with two double beds, in town for 4 days for a convention at the Town Country, happening just on the other side of the I-8 freeway. I'd say mostly positives for us! The property was obviously being attended to while we there, with gardeners replanting and pruning the day we were leaving, the exterior building was being washed down. Very nice plantings all about. Cafe, very satisfactory. Free parking very welcome. Our convention was only a 5 or so minute walk away. We were anticipating free breakfast with the reservation (was discussed when reservation was placed) but because we didn't have documentation of that, we weren't able to counter the front desk assertion that we did not have breakfast with the reservation. So be prepared with your paperwork. Just about once a day, 1 or more of us had our room key cards not work, so we had to go to the front desk to have them reset somewhat tiresome especially because we were housed in the furthest bank of rooms from the office. For the room, yes per other reviews, the a/c is set up such that it's an uneven situation, especially at night when sleeping. We dealt with it. Some sort of problem with shower pipes in the room above, when at 3 and 4 in the morning (!), a loud rattling pipes noise commenced, for a good 10 minutes. We alerted the front desk to the problem in the morning. The noise did not occur the next evening, but it could have been because then there was no one in the room upstairs afterwards during the span of our stay. Sure parking was very tight on the Saturday evening, but it was Saturday night, late we did eventually find a spot.Frig worked well. Plenty of towels. Room didn't at all seem overly dated. Beds were satisfactory. We indulged in the pool one late afternoon, but it ended up being the same time as what appeared to be a family reunion so shifted after a little bit to one of the hot tubs. Very nice nonetheless to have a pool and 2 hot tub options on the property. There is also a small gym facility adjacent to the pool.We would stay here again!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We welcome all guest comments especally when they are so well thought out. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is great knowing you enjoyed our convenient location and that it met your conference needs. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit whether for business or pleasure! Thank you again.
Don't believe this is a 3+ star property. While the room was clean enough, the entire facility is in need of a complete renovation.We were very disappointed as we had a week reservation.My first clue that this was going to be sub-Best Western standards was the fact that their airport shuttle was unavailable for when we were arriving.I will say the hot tub was certainly hot enough and other than the foam that was created when the jets were on(add some more soda ash), was very nice.I am glad we really only slept here as we were about town for most of our stay.Dear Brian: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your candid feedback. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. Exciting things are yet to come, as we are currently undergoing a 2 million renovation, which includes our onsite restaurant Seven Seas Caf, and our infamous Zacks Bar. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are important to us, so we are disappointed not to have met with yours. Our complimentary shuttle service has always been offered based on availability, however, this service has since been discontinued. Please accept our apologies for not having this service available for you. It is our hope that you will consider staying with us again, so we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
I have come to except a certain level of Respect and Professionalism with Best Western Properties, but this one falls below the mark, they have no respect for their Diamond Level customers, the food at the Restaurant is over Priced for what you receive. There is no free or Discounted Breakfast, and no real incentive to eat Lunch or Dinner on property. the Internet works great, Beautiful Property and Housekeeping staff are very nice and courteous.Thank you for the review regarding your recent stay. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed our beautiful property and our nice and courteous housekeeping staff. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. Best Western member properties which do not have on-site full service restaurants are required to provide a complimentary breakfast buffet on-site. Although, we do not offer a complimentary breakfast, our on-site restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, is open from 6am-10pm serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner for our guests convenience. For our hotel guests, we do offer a 15 off on lunch and dinner in our cafe. We hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience.
My friend and I have stayed here twice on two different trips to the San Diego area. It is close to downtown San Diego and Ocean Beach which is important to me. We eat over in Ocean Beach but see theatre shows in San Diego. They did not have any 2 Queen bed rooms available upon check in this past visit but upgraded us for free to a King size bed which worked out perfectly. The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel. Next trip down to San Diego for another theatre show we will be staying here again. Can't recommend this place enough! It's easy freeway access off/on the 8 along hotel row.Dear Jeannette:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your recent hotel accommodations and for being our guest! We are glad you enjoyed our convenient and freeway accessible location, which is close to all San Diego has to offer. It is also great knowing you appreciated our complimentary parking and clean guestrooms. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, and we are delighted we met with yours! It was our pleasure to provide a great experience and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next theatre trip down to San Diego! Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
we stayed here for 4 nights and loved the free wifi, good coverage for TV - tiny tiny bathroom with the sink outside of the bathroom which works well for us, no closet doors there was a fridge in the room and a coffee pot -lots of drawer space, a restaurant and bar on site and free parking - located in hotel circle amongst lots of other hotels -- not really walking distance to anything of interest but easy driving to a huge mall -- one odd thing is that there are two stairs to get to the ground floor rooms from the handicap parking space - good value - very clean - took ages to check in and out - they have all the info they can use before you get there why dont they use it Breakfast was not included in our rate so ask - you may save a ton of money by going elsewhere to eatDear Guest,Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your San Diego accommodations and for sharing your experience. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our free Wi-Fi service, along with the cleanliness of our hotel, free parking, and onsite restaurant and bar. We apologize that the check in process was slower than expected and that breakfast was not included, but we are glad you enjoyed our many amenities. We hope that you will stay with us again soon to experience the many great elements of our hotel. Many thanks again for your time and review.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
it was my last hotel in serious of three during 11 day trip from san francisco so i can compare to few others. the room itself was OK. 2 twin beds that were a little bit small but no surprise there. the bath was fine but the weird thing is that the sink and counter space is outside the bathroom. another weird thing is a full mirror wall on the side of the bed...the walls are very very thin. i felt like the people in the room next door were talking to me. luckily we weren't in the room most of the time but still... the hotel is an open motel kind of space which is nice and has a warm pool at night with steaming water so that's fun. the location at hotel circle is great. close to a lot of things in san diego and i don't think we drove over 1-2 exits in the highway to any of the other attractions. just across the road is the fashion valley mall with a lot of stores and good restaurants if you need to rest.
Wanted a cheap but clean place to stay, and this place worked just fine. They have a free shuttle service which was great. The rooms were cleaner than I expected for the low price I paid, so I was happy about that. However, they could stand to replace their bathroom doors as they are old! The pool and property were nice as well. Staff was friendly. Would stay here again, especially with their great prices.
For the price, around 70 a night, it was average. The room had been somewhat remodeled with new bedding, wallpaper, furniture and drapes. The rooms are very small and tight with two beds. Note that two beds will most likely be 2 doubles, not queens. The bathroom needed work, It wasn't the cleanest. Old door and moldy corners. The grounds of the motel are very nice. However, keep in mind that many temporary workers and hotel help obviously live in the motel. Ask for an upstairs room, the lower rooms are loud. And stay away from rooms across from the laundry. It has a nice pool and hot tubs. The staff was friendly. It is easy access from Interstate 8 and close to the Trolly Stop and Fashion Valley Mall.Dear Traveler, Thank you for your comments regarding your most recent stay with us. We apologize that our property did not live up to your expectations. In regards to the hotel help, our employees are not allowed to stay at the property, but we do have regular guests who work in construction as well as government contractors who work at the Naval shipyards. It pleases us that you enjoyed our convenient property and the friendliness of our staff, and hope that you will reconsider staying with us in the future. Kind Regards,Joe ToczylowskiGeneral ManagerBest Western Seven Seas
Amazing it was the very best I could have stayed or do business in at San Diego. I am most impress as I don't really stay at a lot of great hotels like the best Western. First la jolla, next Mission Valley. I'm sure I'll be staying here again. and in different locations.Dear Floyd: Thank you for providing us with feedback on your recent stay. The Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego is grateful for your kind remarks and glad that you enjoyed the value received. We thank you for choosing us for your hotel accommodations and look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip whether for business or pleasure!Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
Our stay was very nice. The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable. The grounds were clean and nice with all the green plants. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again. Also very close to Old Town and out attractions.Thank you for taking the time to review your hotel experience. We are so happy you enjoyed your stay. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to San Diego. Thanks again!
This was a terrible experience our room had nats and spiders in it. It smelled and the Air conditioned was filthy and did not work. It was disgusting and in need of renovation. I needed a new room and they did not want to accommodate me wanted to send maintenance, No way I already was late for our tour. After about 40 minutes they sent the manager who was absent every time I asked for him. And of course no one could help except him. He finally offered a new old room that smelled but the ac work. We had to move and of course had no time to get ready for our 515 tour. I will be contacting the hotel management to discuss this overpriced horrible experience not the local manager he never called me he didn't like me much after I told the folks checking in check their rooms for bugs!Thank you for your recent review. On behalf of our entire team, we would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. We appreciate that you have brought this area of concern to our attention. Rest assured, each guestroom is routinely deep cleaned and treated with commercial grade steamers as a preventative measure. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is our hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can provide you with a superior experience. Thank you.
Made reservations at the last minute for New Year's eve and it was clearly 20 cheaper for similar hotels in the area. Clean, digital tv. Older style heater/air-conditioner combination controlled by a high/low thermostat rather than temp. It worked fine. Even though next to the freeway, didn't hear a thing in the room.
Overall the experience was good. I would stay there again. The grounds are beauitiful, I will stay there again in June 2015. Great resturants close by and good access to other interesting attractions.Dear LeRoy W.:We appreciate your feedback and kind comments. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and being our guest! We are glad that you and your family enjoyed our beautifully landscaped property. It will be our pleasure to share your comments with our landscape maintenance team. As you know, the Best Western Seven Seas is conveniently located to all San Diego has to offer. In addition to our own great onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, there are other excellent restaurants close by. We look forward to welcoming you back in June! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
It was cheap. It was clean. It was nice. Good restaurants nearby. Seaworld, zoo, and whole lot of beaches no less than 15 min away from hotel. Cafe wasn't too bad either. Jacuzzi was nice as well. Would stay here again.Thank you for the great review of our hotel. We try to offer as much value as we can. Cafe, Zack's Bar, Pool, 2 Jacuzzis, Fitness room, free WiFi and parking. Add all this to the great location and beautiful grounds, we think it's an excellent value. We hope to see you again very soon.
The girls at the front desk were efficient when we arrived, but by the time we had booked in, the 11 or so behind us didn't look too happy as only 2 girls were there and the queue was growing very fast...Decor throughout the main part of the hotel is dated, but well maintained and clean. The motel style units looked well worn out, but we were pleasantly surprised at the fresh decor and up market linens and drapes in our room, which was spotlessly clean and cleaned every day we stayed there.The pool and spa pools are beautiful. I didn't use the fitness room as looked a bit 'testosterone laden' with too many men working out for me, but the pool was clean and warm.It's in a strange situation on 'the Hotel Circle' which literally is a circular route of hotels with an elevated highway running alongside them, about 3-4 miles from downtown, so there is a bit of traffic noise, but Downtown hotels are ALL on the flight path of either the Navy airstrip or the international airport! If you are a light sleeper, ask for rooms in the 210-224's as these are quietest and not poolside either. We slept okay.
The property is very clean including the rooms. You can't beat the location to many attractions like Balboa Park, Sea World, the beaches, and airport. The gym is a bit small and the walls to the rooms are paper thin.
There were some areas great and some were not. We still enjoy the most of them. The location of the hotel was great and very easy access to all amenities. Our best overall service that we were enjoying most was the shuttle drivers. They were very helpful and care a lot to all areas of the service. We all recommended them the best. The second area we enjoyed as well was the dinning in area especially outside. The coffee was great we love it the most too. The service there was great too. Our rooms were good just not much space to move from one end to another but other than that it was okay. The only two areas that we weren't enjoying at all was at the reception area just one receptionist that was very helpful, her attitude was too good at all, she never smile and not helpful too. The other area that we weren't enjoyed was around the all rooms the smoking cannabis it was horrible and very bad, outside where we were staying when open the door we couldn't breath because of the horrible smell as well as people have no respect to other people around.
hotel has a fresh coat of paint since the last visit. pool area nice. great beds. small bathrooms and the faucet puts out just as much water as shower head when shower is on. very friendly staff. restaurant and bar aren't too bad. good location.
Location was great, hotel circle. Very close to everything. Room a little small. Would get up to use restroom in the middle of the night and kept running into the chair. Just my husband and I. Daughter and her husband and three kids in another rooom. Air conditioning didn't work very well in either room..
We needed a hotel with airport transportation arriving rather late in the evening, and this came up online. The bus took awhile to pick us up but the driver was very pleasant and took my husband back to pick up our rental car next morning, and to the airport for a very early flight after our second stay Sunday night. The hotel grounds were attractive, room adequate and breakfast very good, with a discount. Would use it again for a before or after flight motel at half the airport hotel price.
Gnats in room, I had bites all over my body and due to spraying of raid had a severe chemical reaction to my lungs. The walk ways should have been posted slippery due to sprinkler, someone could have had a serious fall. Table by pool area filthy. Mgr Scott was rude regarding my situation!!!! Will not recommend!!!! Food prices in hotel very high.
I enjoyed one of the two hot tubs being open late. The cute theme and color coordinated dcor inside and outside of the buildings put me into relaxation mode. The diner on site is convenient. I slept comfortably in the bed. It was over all a quite restful environment.
First of all I want to say this was a good trip but not because of the MOTEL. We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest,We are happy to hear that you had a good trip to San Diego, but we are sorry that the Best Western Seven Seas did not meet your expectations. Our rooms are often booked months in advance, especially for the summer, and unfortunately we cannot always provide last minute bookings with a specific room type. We are in the process now of updating and upgrading our bedding package which includes mattresses. As for the late night disturbance, we apologize that you were not happy with the way the situation was handled. Guest disturbances should be handled in a very sensitive manner, and we have discussed the management of the issue during your stay with our team leaders and their staff. We are always looking for ways to improve and take your comments seriously. It is the mission of our company to see that each of our guests receives an excellent service experience and we are sorry that your stay did not turn out that way. We thank you for staying with us, and for your valuable input to how we can run our business better. Kind Regards and Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
While looking for affordable accommodations in this area, I kept finding places that charged extra for parking, which is something that just rubs me the wrong way. Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.Thank you for being our guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and taking the time to review our property, we really appreciate your feedback. Hopefully we'll welcome you back soon on your next trip to San Diego.
The rooms were as expected from a Best Western. Nothing special, but very clean. The grounds were very well kept and had beautiful plants that it felt very tropical. Parking was near the room so very convienient, but like a motel experience where the cars are all pulled up in front of the room doors. We enjoyed our visit.
I have used Best Western for business and pleasure trips. I appreciate the amenities even though the quality seems to vary depending on location. The staff have consistently tried to accommodate my needs and random dietary requests and I have appreciated the genuine desire to help my stay at BW be as comfortable as possible.
The Best Western Seven Seas is a great place to stay in San Diego. There is a nice pool and spa. My son likes that there is a restaurant on the property and room service. This hotel is conveniently looked to all the sites of San Diego and a great shopping center!
Was pleased with room, it was clean, bed comfortable. The convenience of having on site restaurant was a plus. Food was good and prices reasonable. Wish i had time to enjoy pool and jacuzzi. Convenient location. Thank you for your kind remarks in regards to your recent stay and for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas! We are happy to hear you enjoyed our clean, comfortable rooms, the food in our onsite restaurant and our convenient location. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to San Diego, thank you.
First time guest at this very pleasant hotel. Grounds are well manicured and nicely layed out. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with a trendy decor. Bathrooms a little dated, but very clean. I usually stay at BW Plus hotels, but this property offered all the amenties I've received in the Plus hotels in a great location for my business trip at an attractive rate. Close to mall, restaurants Quallcom Stadium. Close enough to the airport, without the airport noise. Multiple 2 story walk up buildings. Recommend rooms on the first floor, although car lights could shine into the room if your drapes are open. Staff was friendly, courteous and very professional.
This is a GREAT Hotel! I found this reasonably priced hotel and was very satisfied with my stay. I'm a tough customer. Fair but tough. The rooms are clean. Beds were comfortable. Newly renovated Restaurant and Pool. Parking is good. The grounds are tropical and well kept. The only thing I would want is a renovated bathroom in the rooms. A simple upgrade of tile and new countertops and fixtures would make this property even better. I will definitely stay here when I am in town again.Thank you nso much for the great review. Sounds like you were able to take advantage of all we have to offer. We can't wait to see you the next time you're in San Diego. Thanks again.
This hotel is close to everything shopping ---beaches--zoo-- Balboa Park and only thirty minutes from Legoland. The beds were comfortable and the pool was warm along with two hot tubs one just for adults another where the pool is located.They also had a restaurant and a choice to buy discounted tickets for attractions.also they had Washers and dryers for those wet sandy clothes from the beach.. Thanks would stay here again.
Awful hotel. Low quality for the price. Service was horrible, good luck trying to contact a manager to help solve really simple problems with your stay. The room I stayed in has terrible ventilation and low quality bed, sheets, towels, etc. I am most peeved by the service and wish I could say I had a better experience.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. We welcome all guest comments because they let us know what we are doing well and where we can improve. Thanks again.
Smallish room, clean, comfy bed, no cheesy bedspreads, nice pillows, decent bathroom, coffee maker, easy access from car to room, full on restaurant, pool, hot tub. Friendly fast experience front desk check in. Affordable, clean remote. Will stay here again. Dog friendly too!
Spent a couple of nights here during our stay in San Diego. The hotel is well located near attractions and shopping and easily accessible to highways. It is not a new facility but it appears to be cared for. Beautiful grounds with a nice pool area and two hot tubs. Very helpful staff and a clean facility. We were pleased with our stay.Dear Kat F.: Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations and for being our guest! We are delighted to hear that you appreciated our convenient location, which is close and accessible to all San Diego has to offer. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is nice to know you also enjoyed our beautifully landscaped grounds, our nice pool area, and hot tubs. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, so it will be our pleasure to share your kind remarks to our entire staff. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to welcoming you back, so you and your family may enjoy another nice stay in San Diego! Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
This hotel was clean and easy to access after a long day of driving and playing softball. It was in a kind of run down area and the hotel is somewhat outdated but we were just looking for somewhere clean to sleep. For that reason it was great. The staff was wonderful and very polite with all directions and requested information and help.
stayed here on 3/4/21012free parking, good free wy fi. good location to rental cars and airport.not during rush hour.the queen bed was the worst ever, cold shower, and hair drier did not work at 430 am.manager adjusted the bill. room was clean park in front of room.
Just what you paid for, its a clean hotel. It has enough parking lot for everyone. And its close from most of the important stuff in San Diego. The rooms are not big , but enough to hold a small family
Not bad for hotel circle slightly out dated but clean the restaurant isn't terrible either I guess hot tub is open 24 hours a day pretty grounds slightly inconvenient location however absolutely must have a car
Close to all we wanted to see and the hotel give you a little list of direction to things that is incredibly helpful. Nothing fancy but felt comfortable. Shower pressure not great and limited hot water.
Perfect location with easy access to all of San Diego and free shuttle. Surrounded by palm trees, great hot tubs and pool, friendly, accommodating staff, excellent food, Zack's bar is cozy and fun, room is comfortable with everything you need.Dear Christopher E.,Thank you for your nice comments regarding your recent stay! We're thrilled that you found our hotel to be the perfect place to stay when visiting San Diego. We're glad you enjoyed our complimentary shuttle service as well as our friendly and accommodating staff and our many amenities including our pool and hot tubs. We're also happy to hear that you were pleased with your experience at our onsite restaurant, the Seven Seas Cafe, and our cozy Zack's Bar. Thank you for mentioning our comfortable and well-appointed rooms. We hope to see you again on your next trip to San Diego! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
A chain Hotel but never the less good value for money with large rooms, quiet ambience, a good pool, restaurant and polite staff. Close to the freeways in San Diego's Hotel circle, the Hotel is easily accessible, it's close to the Fashion Valley shopping Mall, it's on the Downtown Trolley route and although it gets busy, it's never overcrowded. A good value for money Hotel away from the busy beach areas. The Restaurant is good value too.Dear Leonard P.:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your hotel accommodations! We appreciate your nice comments in regard to our large guestrooms, quiet ambiance, good pool, our onsite restaurant-Seven Seas Caf, and polite staff. Our property, as you know, is conveniently located and easily accessible. We are also glad that you appreciated and enjoyed the good value of both our guestrooms and restaurant. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are important to us, so we are happy we met with yours.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
We stayed here for a few days in November. All three rooms were nothing less than spectacular. Our rate was awesome through PRICELINE and was under 40.00. The facilities are spotless and the location is super... the crossroads of San Diego... two malls just 2 miles away, great cuisine up the hill and access to the pool and whirlpools were also great.Free parking and everyone we encountered was very nice.We'd pay a little more to stay there again.
This hotel is located such that it's fairly easy to get to most parts of San Diego. The hotel is a little older, but it is kept up well. Food at the diner is a little on the expensive side (NO CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST!!), but the staff are friendly. The room we were in was clean and wasn't too noisy.Thank you for the nice review and for being our guest. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our convenient location located close to all the attractions in San Diego. Hopefully well welcome eyou back real soon. Thank you!
It comes down to this: as usual, you get what you pay for. The hotel is older, but at least it is clean.Pros: price, location (close to everything but not too close), friendly staff, clean rooms.Cons: small rooms, doesn't feel terribly secure, noisy (thin walls), no breakfast, hard beds.
The place was good, but upon checkout I was told they would apply my 40.00 gift card plus an email of my check out. Neither happened. The location is central and the room is good. We had a patio. The staff was not very helpful. The location is on hotel row with 20 other hotels you could chose from. You might try Hampton Inn or one of the others. It is right by the freeway.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. On behalf of our entire team we would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and Staff for specific training purposes, as guest satisfaction and meeting their expectations are extremely important to us. We are however happy to inform you that we have redeemed your gift card and refunded your card, we sent a receipt to your email hopefully you received it. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience and we hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Thank you!
Very nice room, clean and well taken care of. The grounds were very well taken care of with beautiful tropical flowers and palm trees. It was our third stay in 3 years and were again very happy. The heated pool and two hot tubs were awesome.
This hotel is not as it once was when I started visiting it. The staff is still friendly and professional, however it stops there. The rooms are out dated. The internet is intermittent they only provide wireless service. The water pressure is low and it only ever reached luke warm. At one point it turned ice cold on me. Unfortunately, I will find it hard pressed to go back.Dear John K.: Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations and being our guest! Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, so we are delighted to hear you were met with friendly and professional staff. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests.

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your candid feedback and we hope you will consider staying with us again in the future. Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
We were very disappointed that while we made a reservation for a lower level room by the time we checked in we were forced to take a stairwell up to the second floor. We specifically asked for a lower level as my mother has bad hips and a hard time climbing stairs. The second floor would have been fine had there been an elevator at least, but there was not which resulted in us hauling her luggage up for her so she wouldn't fall. We were very displeased by this to start with, but what added insult to injury was the extremely rude nature of the check in receptionist.
Warning:. Do not stay here if you have kids or simply don't mind having others watch you in your room through peepholes. Oct 13th to 16th stay. Peephole discovered above light, which is above sink in room 507. Sheriff's Dept. Notified at 830 am next morning. Staff didn't care and in fact smirked as though they didn't believe it. Corporate responded by email to my complaint stating that since credit card company agreed to reverse charges and police had been contacted, they weren't going to pursue matter, implying somehow that I shouldn't have told in them. Absolutely gross! You have been warned! Stay at own risk! I will update further once the police investigation has completed. Check out the pics of the room, 507. Attached.We are sorry to hear that your recent stay with us did not exceed your expectations. We appreciate your feedback and will use it to make improvements to offer guests a better experience in the future. We hope you will give us another chance and stay with us again. -Best Western Hotels Resorts
I stayed here for 2 days and it was a nice place to stay. The room offered a mini fridge and coffee pot. The room was small but it was only me and I was there just for sleeping. The room was neat and clean when I arrived and while I stayed. I had a ways to walk to get to my room and it was dark so the map that they gave me didn't help much. The air conditioner was a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper it will bother you if you run it at night. The window does open but it is on the walkway side of the room. There are two hot tubs on the property and a pool. I ate at the cafe on the property and it was very good. They DO NOT offer airport transportation but I got and Uber for about 4.
Not what we were expecting from a Best Western. Stayed here with my family of 4 because it was near the zoo and was expecting better from a Best Western. Room with 2 double beds was extremely small, hotel was quite dated and we felt uncomfortable. Thought we could get a roll-away bed with our room but they said it would not fit, They were correctm we could barely move in this tiny, tiny room! Will not stay here again.Dear levine331: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. We are currently undergoing a 2 million renovation, so exciting things are yet to come. Based on hotel occupancy, larger guestrooms are available, so we apologize if you felt our guestrooms were too small. Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations in San Diego and hope you will consider staying with us again, so we may have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
Don't let the Priceline or Hotwire star rating fool you. This is NOT a 3 star hotel. This is an older hotel with wear and tear that makes this more of a 2 star hotel. The last time this place was renovated was (I'm guessing) more than 10 years ago. Tell me, how clean do you expect 10 year old carpet to be The lack of an in-room microwave and no poolside towels are two notable deficiencies. Most Best Western's provide some sort of a breakfast but this place does not. Having said that, the location in Mission Valley is very convenient and when you factor in free parking and discount pricing (from Hotwire / Priceline)... this place is actually a decent value. A Crown Jewel in the Best Western Empire IT IS NOT... but for a short stay at a convenient place in San Diego with free parking, the discount price may offset some of the limitations.
my name is stephanie me and my boyfrien booked this hotel for 4 days i woke up to a silver fish in my bed in top of my arm this mornin january 6 2012 to my luck on my birthday i have a rash in my leg i found 2 of them ... i understand they are bugs but to find them in my bed thats not goood .. i placed them in a container and walk to the front dest i told the front desk girl and she said it was just like a spider .. are u kidding me i cant belive she just said that im very upset i would understad if i would of found them in the bathroom floor or else were buut no it had to be in my bed :( i reserch them and it falls in the bed bugs list ...... the phone dident work they wount even let u reheat your food .... the dinner food is grosse and expensive not a good place to stay in .Dear Stephanie, We are sorry that you had a bad experience at our hotel, and we have spoken with our front desk staff regarding the circumstances you have provided about your stay with us. We would like to apologize for the service you received at the front desk, as our company believes that each of our guests should experience exceptional service when they stay at one of our hotels. The front desk may not have had a situation that played out as yours did before, but we have spoken with the department on how to handle these things better. We are an older property, and like all houses and buildings, there is occasionally the visit from bugs. We undertake a comprehensive pest control program which includes regular visits from a specialist pest control organization for preventative maintenance. It is important to advise our guests that silverfish are indeed not related to bed bugs. We take bed bugs very seriously, as they are an infestation that can travel and affect guest comfort, however we take all bug visitors seriously since your feedback we have notified housekeeping and our pest control department to monitor the area. Regarding your further comment about reheating your food, unfortunately the San Diego County Health Department will not allow food into our kitchen that does not come from a permitted Food Distributor. We are sorry this was an inconvenience for you. Thank you for staying with us and sharing your comments with us.Kind Regards Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
I don't know how they do it. I own a small lodging facility in Alaska and there's no way I could offer this quality for this price. For an aging property, they have done very well with modest rates to manage the upkeep and maintenance. I walked in to my room this time thinking, I don't remember this higher-quality tile... More
I will start with the major issue. This Best Western has no staff that reads of que. It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again.
Staff was great. Close by so many attractions. FREE parking and FREE WiFi. Rooms are decent for what youre paying. No complimentary breakfast, no acces to a microwave. Other than that it was a great experience, had no trouble at Check out. Thank you for the great review of our property and for being our guest. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our convenient location which is close to all of San Diegos attractions. We are also pleased to hear you took advantage of our free parking and Wi-Fi. We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back on your next visit. Thank you!
The rooms are always clean and comfortable. I love the fact that it is several little buildings motel like but Best Western Style. So you walk out of your room right outside through beautifully manicured greenery that are tropical like and CA style. It is low key yet comfortable. The pool has no chlorine and water doesn't smell awful seems... More
Nice , CLEAN, friendly, nice price. I wish the airconditon is not so loud. :) The BW Seven seas in San Diego is the third of the Best Western hotels that I visited and found that each of them is very clean :).Thanks to those ladies who do their part well. I'll be back BW! :)
Hotel is very nice and accommodating. We arrived two hours early and we were able to get right in our room. The grounds are very nice and clean. We found our room to be comfortable for our needs. It does not have a microwave, but it did have a mini fridge. We would definitely stay here again. The staff was very friendly and always available for questions.
Feel secluded with surrounding lush green plants, palm trees and very friendly staff. Caf dining, cocktail lounge, swimming pool/hot therapy pool, fitness center and room service if needed. What more could you ask for at an afforded rate! Loved it!
On a good note, this place has nice hot water, the AC keeps the room nice and cold, the staff are helpful, room service seemed to be very efficient, the beds are comfortable enough, and the one meal I had here was pretty good.On the flip side, our room had bugs (most likely due to the gaping crack around the door), a lot of the outlets did not work, the tub always looked like it had sand in the bottom, and the carpeting looks like it is in bad need of replacement.Solely based on my experience, I cannot recommend this place to anyone. Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We are however, pleased to hear you enjoyed our comfortable beds as well as our helpful and efficient staff. Hopefully you will consider staying with us again in the future so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Thank you!
I've stayed at this property a few times in San Diego. While the doors do not properly fit and the rooms are not the cleanest it was more out of convenience than anything. Three weeks ago I stayed at this property and they charged me for an extra night. I gave them weeks to respond. I have given the management at this hotel and the accounting weeks to respond but they haven't even tried. I've left emails, voice mails, and one person in accounting said they would get back to me. I have now wasted hours on this issue.Thank you for your review regarding your recent stay at our property. We would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and the Staff for specific training purposes. We invite you to contact us directly to provide us with additional details in order to address your concerns. Thank you.
This is a great location and easy on/off from the highway. The zoo is under 3 miles away and Petco Park is under 5. There are other sights close by as well. If you want to minimize your driving in San Diego and still drive to some vacation spots, this is a great choice. Nice pool. No breakfast included but they have a restaurant. Also many other motels within walking distance that also have restaurants.Dear grb53,Thank you for the nice review! We appreciate your kind comments in regard to our convenient and freeway accessible location. As you mentioned, our hotel is just minutes from some of the premier attractions in San Diego including the Zoo and Petco Park. If you prefer to have breakfast included in your rate, we do offer a breakfast package available for an additional cost. Thank you for choosing our hotel for your San Diego lodging needs and were glad you enjoyed your stay!Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
All in all I like this hotel. I stay here every time I am in San Diego for business. Front desk staff unfriendly . rooms are clean. The pool is nice. I wish they midnight curfew for Jacuzzi but unfortunately the Jacuzzi is 24 hours and people can be loud at times
Beautiful grounds and gardens once you check in you are in Paradise. Welcoming staff from the front desk to the hospitality to the maintenance. Pool area largest in the area you don't feel like you are on top of the other guests.Thank you for such and amazing review and for being our guest. We are delighted to hear that you found our hotel to be a home away from home. We look forward to your next visit to San Diego. Thank you!
This is a frustrating hotel it's OK, but with minimal effort it could be so much better.The basic amenities are fine the room was clean the wifi and TV worked, and the bar was open. All good, rightNo...upon check-in, they add a 75 block to your credit card, and say it'll stay from 5-7 business days. That's outrageous, and when I asked why, was told people steal TV's from the rooms. If so, 75 doesn't cover a replacement (and they should rent to better people!). Short-sighted for them I was going to book another night a few days later, but learned they'd block an additional 75...this is building customer loyaltyOn check-out, a guest was complaining that she had no hot water for 3 days...the front desk clerk's attitude was 'management cut back on maintainance. Lovely. Worse, the morning shuttle I'd booked and they reconfirmed the night before was cancelled as the van driver decided to help a family load suitcases into the van......at which point to desk clerk called me a taxi and had the hotel pay for it - a VERY generous gesture!Like I said, a difficult review to write. I wonder if management knows just how hard it's employees work to keep the customers happy
The rooms are a bit small but the hotel is about ten minutes away from the airport. I like that it was near the North Park area, so its a great location if you are catching a flight out of Lindbergh Field and have a car to get around. Probably not the best place if you want to spend a night partying in San Diego.
I checked in for one night over a July weekend and found the staff at the front desk to be very helpful. The clerk asked me where I'd prefer my room and I asked for somewhere quieter. She was able to put me in a room further away from the pool/stairs which was very great. The room was clean and smoke free as promised. The AC also worked very well. I would recommend earplugs if you go to bed early or want to sleep in, as other guests come back late and leave earlier for the near by attractions. During the night I couldn't hear anything from either neighboring room which was very nice!
I booked site unseen as I am a Best Western Rewards member. This hotel is older than the seven seas! The outside is old and needs maintenance, appearing more like a highway side trucker motel than a hotel. Rooms are old and musty, with water and moisture damage radiating from the bottom of the exterior door and bathroom door. I know it's moist in San Diego, but doesn't necessarily mean the room should smell moldy. Room appeared clean at first glance, but tile floor in shower/toilet area needed scrubbing and vanity looked like it was never dusted. Shower water was luke warm.Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay at our property. We would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities to meet the needs of our guests. Rest assured your concerns are being shared with the appropriate departments in order to be discussed. We hope that you will consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Thank you! -Team BW7S
We checked in here for four nights before moving to our apartment in San Diego, this hotel is in hotel circle, so not many bars and restaurant are around, but its 20 mins walking distance to fashion valley, so if you love shopping, do take advantage of that! The Zacks bar in the hotel has happy hour every day from 4 to 7, we really liked that. Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. We are also pleased to hear you liked the happy hour in our bar. Hopefully well welcome you back for a stay-cation or even just for happy hour. Thank you!
good service over all in the hotel in outside the hotel closed to my conference a walking distance, the restaurant got good service and good food, the room was clean, the parking no problem, and it was no smoking on the room it is excellent
I visited this hotel twice with my family and we all loved it. Easy access on and off the freeway all while being a quiet and safe hotel. The room had upgraded new furnishings and there was a restaurant on site.
This is the first time I have ever been moved to write a hotel review, but this hotel far exceeded my expectations. It is in the same area as a number of other low-budget properties, and I have stayed in several because it is close to my daughter, but from this point forward I will always choose this hotel. The...

Overall great value for the price we paid. Rooms are clean, comfy beds, a little dated but I enjoy the retro look so worked for me!Highlight was definitely the heated pool and hot tub, our kids never wanted to leave...the grounds were beautiful and well kept. We ate at the restaurant 5 times and the food was good, nothing outstanding but hit the spot and service was great.Another bonus was that it was close to the fashion valley mall transit location so we were able to get around and see the sights and beaches with public transit easily and a day pass for adults was only 7. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to families with kids and travelling on a budget!Thank you for the nice comments. We glad you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of many of our amenities. We hope to see you again real soon. Thanks again.
Very clean and close to everything San Diego has to offer.Close to the freeway for access to everything. The restaurant had good food where we dined for breakfast and dinner on a few different occasions, Patrick was our server and was very accommodating and personable . The room was very clean and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. The price was more than reasonable and we will stay there again if we are in the San Diego area.Dear Bradstaaf,Thank you so much for your great comments! We are so happy to hear that you appreciated the cleanliness of our property and rooms as well as the value you received. We are glad that you were pleased with our convenient location with easy access to the freeway and close to all that San Diego has to offer. We are also glad that you liked our Seven Seas Caf for both breakfast and dinner, and that Patrick took care of your needs in a personable manner. We will be more than happy to pass the kind words on to him! Thank you again for taking the time to review the Best Western Seven Seas and we welcome the opportunity to be of service to you during your next visit to San Diego. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
The grounds are really pretty, the rooms are very nice and clean. The staff is very nice. The WiFi did not work well in my room. My room was in the 200 building around the back and it was very quiet. I was very impressed about the charges incurred if you smoke in the room- that is a great way to keep all rooms smoke free! The bathroom was very small. One thing I did not like was all the smoking at the pool- I ended up not going to the pool because of the number of people smoking. I also was disappointed that the hotel does not offer a free breakfast.
I checked out and moved to another Best Western in town right after I checked in to this hotel. Checking in experience was very bad, desk clerk was poorly trained. I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!Dear Sally C.,Thank you for your review, we appreciate your valuable feedback. We've read through your review in detail and are sorry to hear of the service and room cleanliness issues you experienced. It is our top priority to ensure each guest has an exceptional stay and it appears we fell short of this goal during your visit. Rest assured, we will discuss your concerns with our staff to prevent these issues from reoccurring for future guests. Thank you again for your review. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
I am being nice rating this place average, this hotel is stuck in the 70s as far as decor, the room noise from room to room is bad, everytime your neighbor open and closed thier door it felt like they were in your room, not good.
great staff-heated pool-comfy bed-clean room and great location-disappointed with the wifi but otherwise it was very nice. There is a bar and a caf onsite-very convenient. Close to nearby attractionsThank you for being our guest and for your recent review. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed our great staff and our convenient location close to everything San Diego has to offer. We look forward to having you on your next visit to San Diego. Thank you!
Everything was excellent will definitely be going back soon the quality was great and the staff were very helpful and made everything easy for my family and I as soon as we got there they were very friendly and professional.Thank you for taking the time to write such a great review.

We really enjoyed staying in this room. It was very clean and the decor was nice. The location was not hard to find and it was nice and secluded. Area was nice and the outside was pretty. The staff was very helpful and happy. Overall amazing experience.Dear Isamarra: Thank you for providing us with your kind remarks. We are glad you enjoyed staying in our clean and nicely decorated guestrooms. It is great knowing you found our location convenient, yet secluded.

Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to welcoming you back, so you may have another amazing experience!Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
Stayed several nights in June 2012. (Check several sites on the Internet for the best rates under 100 a night. Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small, but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable, but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills, elipticals, and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout, ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall, Old Town, and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times, particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby, but there are also cheaper fast food places.
I stayed here for one night in a single queen room. The room was very small and dated. The worst part of this property is how thin the walls are. You can hear every conversation that your neighbors are having as well as anytime the toilet is flushed, shower is on, door is open/closed etc. If you are only looking for a cheap place to stay this may suit your needs but there are many better options in hotel circle (even for the same price).
We moved to this hotel from two doors down and were extremely pleased. The rooms have been renovated in the past 2 months and were clean and fresh, albeit small. I recommend buildings 1,2, or 3. The grounds were lovely and calming and the pool was clean. Downsides: No continental breakfast, slow internet connection, a microwave didn't come with our room and the shuttle times weren't great for young children. Also, the TV channels were extremely limited, and there's no DVD player, but you can pay for Disney shows or Curious George at 4 each episode. We walked over to Bunz for food which was better than the restaurant. Great location, close to everything, but you need a car.
The grounds are dimly lit at night and it is hard to find your room at night. The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see. Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card. Overall the grounds were well kept and the room was clean, but had poor appliance, electrical outlet and furniture placement. No elevator for 2nd floor rooms.
We have now stayed here three times and really like this place. While it is not on the water, it is close to the Pacific and most other attractions in San Diego. The staff are well trained and friendly and we actually are offered upgrades due to our BW Ride Rewards status. This does not happen at most BW hotels. The rooms are nice but a bit dated. We love the property since it really seems like a tropical resort. We come to San Diego quite often and will certainly make the BW Seven Seas our property of choice.Dear PaulSchm,Thank you for being a loyal guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and for taking the time to write your wonderful review. We are happy to hear that you were satisfied with our friendly staff and our convenient location. We are currently going through numerous renovations throughout the hotel, including granite counter tops for the bathrooms, wood cabinetry, and upgrading various amenities. Thanks again for your time and we look forward to accommodating you again soon!Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
My husband and I drove into SDiego after a 7 1/2 hour drive. (Avoid Hwy 5 if you're coming in from up north. Tons of roadwork). Anyway, the staff was friendly and quick to serve us. It was 2am so there wasn't a line. But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card. So I stayed here to earn points. But, note to self: won't be staying here for an extended stay. Can't say I'd recommend it to others.
Convenient to many different places to go. Shopping, airport, Beaches, Museums, Eateries, Everything ! The staff is very helpful, Zaks Bar is a fun place to sit and un-wind, The PG Lounge is seperate from the restaurant and you can sit out by the pool and lounge outside as well. They open up the large BBQ for guests, poolside, for fun. It's an older establishment, but they keep it up, and it's just right for the budget -oriented person, or, family ,when taking those trips to the amusement parks. Pretty close to everything. Centrally located !Dear Thomas M M:Thank you for being our guest and providing us with your feedback. We appreciate all your great comments in regard to our centrally and conveniently located property. As you know, the Best Western Seven Seas is close to all San Diego has to offer. We were pleased to hear you enjoyed our very helpful staff including those in our infamous Zacks Bar. Our property is older however, we are continually upgrading both inside and out in order to meet the needs of our guests. We are also glad that you were thankful for the value you received while staying here. Thank you for choosing us for your hotel accommodations and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip whether for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
This is a wonderful hotel, a real tropical paradise in Mission Valley. The staff are very attentive and work to accommodate you. The rooms are nice with everything you need. I will always stay here when visiting San Diego!
Wasnt used to this but ok. Will check account to make sure it drops off when you leave. Clean and pretty quiet. The restaurant made a special pizza for me that was tasty. Hotel is near Sea World and good for families.
I stayed at this motel from 7/11 - 7/16 2012 for Comic-Con. I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location.
This hotel is not on or close to the strip but perfect if you are in Las Vegas to golf or sight see. We were not interested in being close to the strip and this hotel was perfect. It was clean and relatively new. The rooms were nice with new decor and the breakfast was good with enough selection for our needs. I would stay here again if we found ourselves in the area
Older hotel but very comfortable and a great staff, very helpful to any of your needs. Internet worked with no slow downs and the pool was inviting. The fitness roomwas great. I stayed there ten years ago and many of the same helpful staff are still working there.
Great location. Was close to downtown Sam Diego and had numerous shops and restaurants nearby. Room was clean and comfortable. Only negative was that we needed to use the laundry facilities and they were perpetually busy during the evening. What should have taken 1 hour took much longer as we had to wait for machines. Management should consider extwnding this facility.
The room was ok. I stayed there from Friday to Monday. We couldn't even get a late check out. Check out was at 12. And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations and would be happy to host your next visit to San Diego and provide you with an excellent stay given the chance. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
This hotel in on Hotel Circle not far tho old san diego, but really near from highways. The room was cleam, but really small. There is a restaurant and a free access to Internet. Cheap, but you could maybe find something more interestinf near the ocean. You could maybe have a few difficulties to park your car (there aren't many places in the area. Here, you will see only the cars...
The freezing pool. The broken jacuzzi. The unfriendly staff. The rattley old refrigerator in the room. The only cheapest harsh bright white lights used, no night lights. We could hear everyone above and beside us, so the construction of this place is very poor.
Went to San Diego for a few days to go on a Pelagic Birding trip. Registered at the Best Western Seven Seas. Beautiful setting. Felt like I wasn't in the city at all. Right by the Interstate, it was still quiet. The grounds, well kept, were like a tropical paradise. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The staff in... More
This hotel is centrally located close to the many attractions that San Diego has to offer. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I was traveling with a group of just over 20 people and upon our arrival they had all our rooms ready for check in. But, not only that, they also had all our keys labeled with our names and room numbers already on them. That made for such a smooth registration and check in (as well as check out). Our stay was for 4 days and 3 nights. Another convenience the hotel provided was a shuttle ride to and from the SD Zoo. Eliminating the chore of fighting through traffic, driving (in an unfamiliar area), and parking. The rooms were well maintained, clean and had small refrigerators in each room. The hotel also has a pool (which we didn't have time to use) and a restaurant serving home cooked meals on site. I also liked that it was quiet.Dear MariaLC60: Thank you for your nice remarks in regard to your recent stay. It is certainly appreciated! We are so glad that you enjoyed our friendly and efficient Staff, as well as our complimentary shuttle service that offers transportation to many local area attractions. It is a delight knowing you also appreciated our well maintained guestrooms, quiet property, and the convenience of a pool. Perhaps, you will have the chance to utilize it on your next visit. We are happy that you loved our onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner from 6am-10pm for our guests convenience. Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your hotel accommodations and for being our guest! Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
Even though I was on Hotel Circle which is right off the main highway, the Seven Seas is at the very end and quiet. My room was on the back side and after spending the previous two nights at a BB right under the flight line for the airport it was nice to sleep in past 6:30 am. Beautiful landscaping and the restaurant staff were very nice. Everything very clean
we enjoy staying at the Best Western Seven Seas have done so for many years we are treated like family We always enjoy the Seven Seas Best Western they treat you like family they have a nice pool and fitness center and everything is near the bartenders are great had funThank you so much for the great review. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you on your next visit to San Diego. Thanks again!
Good location for getting around the San Diego area. Priced fairly. If your a couple and you can, get the king room. Nice pool area and bar lounge. Decent restaurant on site. Don't go for the fitness center.Dear Robert S.:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your recent stay! We are glad that you enjoyed our convenient location along with the value received. It is delightful knowing you appreciated our nice pool area, our infamous Zacks Bar and onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, open from 6am-10pm serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner for our guests convenience. We are disappointed you did not care for our poolside workout room which contains a treadmill, elliptical, and stationary bike and apologize for not meeting with your expectations. It was our pleasure to provide you a great experience overall and look forward to welcoming you back. Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
Very good value. They have gone above and beyond to create a nice outdoor environment with a hawaiian feel. Bar could use some serious renovations. Although they had beer on tap I chose to avoid the bar because it was just depressing. Bed was comfortable, good pillows.
This hotel could use a remodel. The rooms are very run down. Thankfully the beds are comfortable. They had a broken light plate switch on the mirrored wall that my toddler started to play with and we quickly had to shue her away from and block. The tub wouldn't hold water for a bath for my kid. The thing that made me the most angry was they didn't provide microwaves. When I called about it they said I could pay an additional 10.99 a night for a microwave. Are you kidding me Obviously this is a scam to force you to eat at their cafe restaurant. I walked down the street instead and ate at the Burger Bunz restaurants..great food.Dear Guest,Thank you for being a guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and for taking the opportunity to share your feedback. We are sorry that we were unable to provide you with the quality of rooms you were expecting from us. We are currently going through renovations throughout the facility and we hope you can experience the changes in the future. We apologize that we do not provide the rooms with microwaves, but we do provide each room with a refrigerator, in-room coffee maker, and free Wi-Fi. We hope you return and enjoy our many other amenities offered throughout the hotel. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
I needed a place to stay near Old Town, San Diego and selected the Best Western Seven Seas. Yes, It is a bit outdated, but a good value for the money. I need to say that when I booked, Comic Con was going on in San Diego. So, I was left with few choices. Best Western Seven Seas came through. This time my stay was great. The room was fine. I was able to use their shuttle bus to take us to Old Town and pick us up afterward. Hotel staff are pleasant and willing to assist. The restaurant is good. No complaints.Dear Carlos G.,Thank you for your recent stay with us and for taking the time to write a review. It was nice to hear your kind remarks regarding our great value, helpful staff, our onsite restaurant and our convenient location. We're glad to read that you were able to take advantage of our complimentary shuttle service. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip down to San Diego.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
Everything was great with my stay, However upon taking our first shower the soap holder fell off the wall. As is it was freshly put on that day, No apologies or anything. I was shocked. But they did come back and replace it and taped a plastic bag over it.Thank you for your kind review of our hotel. We are glad to hear everything was great. Thank goodness maintenance was able to resolve the soap holder issue quickly and efficiently. We hope to see you on your next visit to San Deigo. Thank you again!
I was worried because the price seemed low compared to other hotels in the area, but I took a chance because it looked great. IT WAS! Fun friendly bar, beautiful grounds, good food at restaurant, perfectly heated pool, plenty of parking, convenient location. Had forgotten I'd stayed here before, and the place was great the first time too. Will definitely stay again when I am in the area.
Pro's..... great staff, clean rooms beautifully kept grounds and facilities. Free wi-fi, guest use of computer and printer, cafe on site, free airport shuttle.Con's.....no in-room microwave, thin walls, isolated location.no free breakfastEmployee was late for work so the airport shuttle started a bit late, but that was our only real complaint during our stay.
The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself is a hit or miss.Upon arrival, the room was very small, crowded, outdated uncomfortable. Not what you would expect from a BW Plus hotel.We unpacked most of our stuff and went for dinner, only to come back to discover the bathroom had not been cleaned and there was urine and pubic hairs on the floor. I was extremely grossed out and could not use the bathroom.The TV box was also missing so we could not use the TV.I contacted the front desk girl and she was able to switch us to a different (and bigger) room that had been renovated, and was clean so that was a huge relief. She was able to do this even though it was close to midnight.The TV box was stolen from the new room as well (these must be popular in the USA...lol), but the great maintenance man was able to get one from another room and install it the next day for us.The hotel itself was very close to lots of activities, so the location is good, but if you want a nicer room, go with 2 queens or a king.
This hotel Does Not provide shuttle service it is advertised on Trip Advisor as provided but is inaccurate please update as it cost money to take a taxi shuttle or ride share. The hotel is a good value nothing fancy but clean, the staff was friendly. The restaurant is adequate again nothing fancy but the food was good, we had the French dip and chicken noodle soup. Would stay again but prefer accommodations with airline shuttle service.
The front desk staff needs an introduction to providing better customer service they do what they think their job is, but without any real consideration for the guest in front of them. The room smelled strongly of cleaner enough to make my eyes water. The two control knobs on the A/C unit were broken and amateur repaired so that they did not work. The soap in the bath, down to a sliver, was not replaced. The coffee supplies were not replenished and the waste basket not emptied. They allow people to wander around the facility slipping flyers for other restaurants under the doors not a warm feeling for security awareness. The Cafe served an excellent breakfast good food and excellent friendly staff. I'd suggest you do not pay the up-charge to get breakfast 'included' in the room cost. You can get a good breakfast at the Cafe for much less than the higher room rate, and, if you want to go somewhere else, there are dozens of other restaurants in walking distance. Next time, I'll try a different hotel chain and walk over to the BW Cafe for breakfast.
I basically live out of hotels and this is the WORST I have ever seen. Staring with parking you are paying 12.00 for a spot that you have to do a 3 point turn to get into and my Camry almost didnt fit into. The room was super small for being a family suite and everything was cramped. The was enough space between the foot of the bed and the tv table was wide enough for a vacuum to fit though as well as the space between the bed and the wall. The second room was divided by a French door only the fixed side of the French door had window covering so there is no privacy between rooms and the lights from either room shines into each other. The AC was weak and smelt like mold. The second room never got air and by the time you go to the bathroom forget it just open the window to let the air in. There is no circulation, except what was provided by a large fan in the wall between rooms that was extremely loud and reminded me of an attic fan. One good thing the bed was comfortable for a single night stay. This location does offer breakfast, but after making a waffle and getting a plate together and sitting down to eat each of us took a bite and ended up at Dennys down the street. I wasnt expecting a Hilton or the Ritz Carlton, but I was expecting something a little higher than what ended up looking like highway motel. Lucky for us we were there only one night before heading home to Los Angeles.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for your honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay at our hotel. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every stay. I greatly appreciate your comments about aspects of the room that need updating.

It would be such a pleasure to personally welcome you back to our new and improved hotel!With much appreciation,Laura BensonOperations Manager619-881-4004
We stayed for two nights and chose this location because it was close to things we wanted to do. My first issue is the parking and there's not enough spaces. We had a suite that had a closed off living room but the AC unit was in that room and so even with the door open the rest of the room was hot. There was fan on wall but it was so loud you couldn't talk. The room was very small, so much that only one person could fit between the tv and bed. The shower was horrible. The temp never stayed the same. The doors into the building and the elevators were barely functioning. The pool was dirty and the surrounding area. Breakfast was okay. The staff was not very friendly or accommodating. We have never been to CA and so we had a lot of questions and the staff acted like it was such a burden to answer them. Overall I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't let my friends or family go either. Dear guest,I apologize for not meeting your expectations. I have shared your comments with our GM and Staff. Thank you Regards,Laura Benson
Staff was friendly and professional. Rooms were nice and clean. Pool and jacuzzi was great. Breakfast was delicious. We enjoyed use of the breackfast room for my husband's 60th birthday .Our kids and grandkids where all very comfortable in the suites. Thanks again!

Feel free to give us a call before your next stay so we can make sure you have the utmost accommodations.
We stayed at this hotel last year for 10 nights and while the rooms weren't completely up to date, it was clean, had extra room, breakfast was decent, and for the price we felt we got a great deal. Based on our past experience, we booked again for a family reunion and referred our family to also book this hotel. We arrived late at night and check in was fine. The lobby still looked nice and the elevator was still slow like we remembered. The first thing we noticed when we got to our room and turned the bed down were the yellow stains on the sheets. At this point I wasn't sure if the sheets had been laundered and they were permanent stains, or if the sheets had not been changed. I called the front desk and they had me come get a new set of sheets. By the time I got back up to the room, my husband had discovered the towels hanging in the bathroom had fresh lipstick/makeup all over them. I went back to talk to the front desk and the employee decided it was time to try a different room. Room 2 had a ant on top of the pillows on the bed and when we turned down the bed and pulled the pillows away from the headboard out ran 10 more. Back to the front desk we went and were now headed off to room 3. When opening the door to Room 3 we were immediately hit with what I can only describe as B.O. and it was potent. I called the front desk and told them about the smell and told them we would tough it out for the night as it was getting super late and we had a baby with us. I asked when the manager would be in the next day and was told 10 a.m. I ran the air vent on the airconditioner and also turned on the bathroom exhaust fan all night. The next morning the smell was as bad as ever. It literally was oozing out of everything in the room-the mattress, the couch. There were ants in this room also, but they were crawling on the wall instead of instead of in the bed. I headed down to visit with the manager of the hotel and found he was out due to an emergency. I expressed my concerns to the staff that was there (the housekeeping supervisor and a young gentleman) and asked to cancel the rest of my stay as well as the reservations for my family that would be arriving in town later in the week. The housekeeping supervisor came up to the room and acknowledged the smell and thought that it was possibly wet carpet-my opinion was that the room smelled due to body odor and not cleaning the room thoroughly. The only rooms the hotel had left were double rooms and she offered to let me walk through one before moving all of my belongings again, but I declined as we had already switched rooms 3 times and I also was very concerned about how many times my family coming into town would have to switch rooms to find an acceptable one.This hotel has drastically gone down hill in cleanliness since we stayed here last year. The linens in all of the rooms were stained and the towels were threadbare and grey. There were ants in 2 of the 3 rooms we checked into that night. I felt this hotel was along the lines of a motel 6 at best. Free breakfast cannot make up for a filthy hotel that is not being cleaned properly. We actually witnessed a maid RUNNING into and out of a room in less than 5 minutes. How do you clean a room that fast And we certainly didn't see a vacuum. We were wondering if the maids were paid by the room and not the hour. I do want to say the front desk staff was very accommodating and tried their hardest to find an acceptable room and I appreciate that they were willing to cancel our reservations when they realized their hotel had too many issues. ****PLEASE HIRE A SUPERVISOR FOR YOUR MAIDS AND INVEST IN REPL.ACING OLD/STAINED LINENS AND TOWELS***Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at the Comfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area in San Diego.

Great price for a 2 room suite with fridge microwave + TV's in each . Sliding doors can seperate second room from bedroom with king bed. Sofa in second room is a hide a bed. Big pool great for kids+ hot tub for adults. Mission Valley Mall just min's away with good choice of restaurants. Staff very helpful. Free breakfasts had great variety was best that we've had. Rooms could use some minor repairs but not VIP. Very pleased with stay.
Ok people, before the bashing begins just remember you are paying roughly 129/night and you get free WiFi and a hot breakfast to boot. All in an area where it usually runs 200+/night. You get what you want to pay for it. You will not get Hilton like amenities at this kind of deal.First the good:1) Great location, right off the freeway, 2 min from a huge shopping mall and plaza with everything under the sun to eat at. 10 min from Seaworld or Gaslamp or Qualcomm.2) Good breakfast, decent choices, some healthy items, coffee is good.3) Fridge and microwave in the rooms. AC works nicely. The bed was good, with a lot of pillows, which I believe they just switched out to new ones.4) Friendly staff at front desk. Now the not so good, or you get what you pay for:1) The pool is loud when active until 10pm. The rooms face the pool in an L shape, it echoes through the halls. If no one is there, then it is fine. During summer, it's brutal.2) The rooms do need updating. You can see it is a work in progress, but the walls in my rooms were all marked up, the decor was outdated. Hallways and elevator showed heavy signs of use. Pocket door for bathroom was very heavy and loud. One telephone didn't work, etc. Our blackout drapes were torn and pulling away from the window, so it did not stop much light during the day for my son's naps.3) Thin walls. We heard every footstep above us, every creak. We also heard everything in the halls, and with the outdoor floors you can hear everything rolling on it, or people walking through. Once asleep, not a bother.4) 8 parking fee. Whatever, it is stated on the website. Just add it to the room rate and call it free, makes the customer feel better and not nickel and dimed.5) Ant attack in our room, but they did remedy quickly when we notified. 6) The sofa bed was a joke. 7) Elevator would take us to level 3 when we pressed level 2. All day, until I told them about it.Look, this place is ok. You get good value for the rate you pay, which is cheap. It is obvious the manager is doing a lot of damage control here on TripAdvisor by trying to respond to all complaints, which reflects why the ranking for this hotel is so low, as there are a lot of complaints.Would I stay here again with family Probably not. But for a cheap room, and if I was by myself maybe. But not for my family, there were too many annoyances, but we walked out of there for under 300 total for two nights. Good luck people. But don't nail the resort for not being like Hilton when you are only paying 129/night ok!It was my pleasure to read your objective review that pointed out the things you liked about our hotel, as well as some of the things you had a concern with. We read and act upon all our reviews in order to improve the service and comfort of all of our guests. It is clear you understand we are a very conveniently located hotel that offers reasonable rates, unique room layouts and features, a free breakfast buffet and most of all, dedicated professional staff. I agree there are some aspects of our hotel that are a bit overdue for attention, however we do have an on-going and aggressive improvement and upgrade schedule. This year the focus has been on new linen, early next year will be the furniture upgrades and dcor, among other items. As much as we would like to, we cant get everything new all at once, however we do have excellent engineers who keep things running smoothly, or if a guest discovers something we missed. Some things like a busy swimming pool in summer vacation season or parking fees for most all hotels in this area are things we cannot change. Even so as you pointed out, we think we offer the best in rates, location and value to our guests. We sincerely appreciate your business and taking the time to provide your comments to us and hope you will stay with us again to see all the great things we are doing at Comfort Suites, Mission Valley! Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming, General Manager
We picked this hotel due to its proximity to Sea World. The room was outdated but large and clean. The only complaint we had was we were on the first floor right by the pool. It was noisy most nights up to 10 p.m.Breakfast was pretty good. Parking was free since we booked with a travel agency. Restaurants and shopping was 5 minutes away.We would stay there again but in a room further from the pool.
My wife and I recently spent a night at this property. We had never stayed at a Quality Suites property before. We came away very impressed. For our stay, at the end of May, it seemed the majority of the renovations had been completed. We received a complimentary room upgrade, thanks to Frederick Ross at the Front Desk. He was very helpful and very friendly.Our room was exceptionally clean and well appointed. The bed was firm and comfortable. Huge bathroom. There was a jacuzzi tub and even a gas fireplace.The Internet was fast and easy to hop on. The breakfast in the morning was also very good with a nice variety of hot items. It was easy to get to some very nice restaurants for a good meal as well.All in all we will now include Quality Suites in our list of choices for properties to stay at while traveling. An excellent value andDear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your recent stay with us. We work hard to insure our guest have a pleasant stay while they visit with us. We are pleases to hear we were able to exceed your expectations. We look forward to serving you again very soon.Kind regards,Laura Benson
We stayed here on October 9-12 and the entire weekend the ice machines and soda machine on our floor was out of order. I did not check the other floors' soda machines. The parking was 12 a night and very tight for out Yukon XL. The breakfast was good and the beds were comfortable. Dear Guest,Thank you for going online and completing our survey. I would like to apologize for the ice machine on your floor not working, we are working on making sure this doesn't happen again. Sorry for this inconvinence . Your feedback is appreciated and very important to us. We were glad to here you still enjoyed our hotel and hot breakfast. We hope you visit us again soon.Warm Regards,Laura BensonOperation Manager619-881-4004
The King suite with 2 double beds is great, although very tight space. The beds are bunkbeds in a separate room with door. Each room has a TV. There is a heated swimming pool with hot tub.The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was at the end of the corridor, so very quiet.The price is very reasonable, but there is a large fee for parking.Dear Janet, Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Art CollantesGeneral ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley(619)-881-4000
The TV and refrigerator was not working. Excellent customer service to fix the problem. The location is close to restaurants and shopping mall. Free breakfast was great with fresh fruit, eggs, sausage , cereals,patties, yogurt, pastries,waffle maker. Parking fee12. The room was clean, room had 2 separate sleeping areas which was nice. Room had 1 bed and the other area had bunk beds. Good fir 4 people. Looking for a less expensive hotel this place will be fine in San Diego.Dear Felicita W,Thank you for sharing your comments, your feedback is very important to us. I have shared you comments with our GM and Hotel Staff. Happy to hear you enjoyed your time with us. We look forward to serving you again in the very near future.Kind Regards,laura bensonGuest Service Manager

Great Stay-I was provided an upgraded suite room. Very nice. Room suite very spacious. All hotel amenities were readily available. Hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. I will definitively stay here again. I like the close proximity to freeway, shopping center and restaurants. Waffle house restaurant breakfast was fantastic and very delicious.

It was an excellent stayPerfect location for my conference.The person at the front desk rather seriousThe maid service excellent, thanks to the manager of the cleaning staff, very friendly, helpful, and hardworking, kindly helped me with my luggage, to prepare my waffles at breakfast, I saw her there helping too!I will recommend this hotel to my friends and I will visit again
We stayed here on a 9 night vacation in San Diego. We had a tremendous deal that could not be beat for the amenities this hotel provided. Our kids (ages 4 6) loved swimming in the pool just about daily. Although I enjoyed the hot tub, the drains maybe were plugged since a couple nights the water was spilling over with n a couple people in the hot tub. However I did not notify staff-so I am not complaining, it seemed resolved in subsequent nights.We did have an issue we reported to request a new tub drain plug/stopper and never did get one. We requested twice and the second time was two days before we left so when the kids took baths that night we just made do since we weren't going to wait for maintenance during the bedtime hours.All in ill we had and enjoyable trip and this was a tremendous centralized location for all the sites we wanted to see.
Very unique room configuration especially if you are a family. Doors open to the outside which all face inward to the open courtyard. First section or the room is your main bed, tv, mini fridge and microwave, then the second section separated by a siding interior door is a bunk bed, chest and tv then the back section of the room is the full bath. The bath area looks like it was updated at some time and is nice, staff has plenty of soap, shampoo, coffee and towels stocked. Staff was in the process of replacing all mattresses in the main beds of all rooms while I was there, in fact mine was being replaced as I checked in. Parking can be tough if the hotel is full especially if you drive a big car or truck. Exterior is in need of maintenance. Breakfast was plentiful and the normal Comfort Suites breakfast. Wifi was good. One thing that really disappointed me was the lack of many channels available on the TV. Had network channels, a couple of independent channels, did have Fox News but didn't work the last day I was there. No other news channels.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for your honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay at our hotel. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every stay. Very glad to hear you still enjoyed your stay with us even though there were some areas we do need to work, we will continue working on.. I hope we get to have you visit us again in the near future.Warm Regards,Laura BensonOperations Manager619-881-4004
Spent the first three nights of a family trip here, using it as a base to see Legoland and Seaworld. The hotel itself is fine (we had a room with a bedroom separated by a sliding door for the children, complete with bunk beds), has a good outdoor pool and spa, and a decent free hot breakfast. All in all nothing sensational, but clean, tidy, reasonable value and - assuming you don't miss the turn off from Mission Valley Fwy! - in a convenient location, only 5-10 minutes from Seaworld and maybe half an hour from Legoland.I am very pleased you enjoyed your stay with us and you were able to enjoy our pool and spa, as well as SeaWorld and LEGOLAND. Sorry you had hard time finding our hotel our frequent guests like to remember that we are on the same exit as the Mission Valley Mall. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us, too often, guests do not take the time to share their positive comments but the good service you experienced is what my staff and I strive to provide to each and every guest. We hope to see you again soon! Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming General Manager, Comfort Suites Mission Valley.
I think it has been said previously if you are expecting a Hilton at this price, you'll be disappointed. Overall this is a very good property to stay at. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms stayed cool when using the air conditioner. We stayed a total of six nights here, five at the beginning of our trip, then checked out and went up to Disney for five days, then back for one night before flying out the next day. We were happy with the kids suite with the bunk beds. The bunk beds were a little squeaky going up and down, and while the child settled down trying to go to sleep, but nothing that kept anyone awake. The top floor was great for that length of stay, didn't have to worry about ceiling noise that way. The first night I didn't leave the fan on the air conditioner and heard the highway noise come through in the morning and thought a window was open. Turns out the door isn't completely sealed and noise comes through so leave the fan on (it kept the room nicer to sleep anyway). If you are a really light sleeper and can't have the fan on, you might not enjoy this place. The breakfast was really, really good. One of the best setups I have seen. Don't doddle getting down there as they are good at keeping everything nicely filled till about 9:10. Since the breakfast ends at 9:30 on weekdays, the doors are closed at 9:30. If you go down there at 9:25, get everything you need before going to sit down because you won't have a chance to refill because it CLOSES AT 9:30 PEOPLE. At least 4 days we were sitting on the patio waiting for out slowpoke eater to finish and people are getting mad at the girls trying to close the doors and clean up the breakfast because THEY weren't finished eating. Get up and get down there in time and don't bh at the girls doing their job.The kids really enjoyed the pool, we only had time to use it twice but they had a good time. I would have liked to use the hot tub but it was not working while we were there. It was a good week for us, the pool wasn't too busy and was quiet by 10:00. Thank you for adding to our great San Diego/Disney trip, we had a great time.
Hotel is ok , but need upgrades in the rooms, the carpet, t.v. Is small the bathroom can use up grade tike in floor. When you call front desk and tell them someone right next to you is smoking and you are allergic to smoke. Accommodate me by offering another room, and not say ok and we will check it out. Dear guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us regarding your recent stay.i would like to apologize on behalf of the Hotel and Staff members for the problems you encountered during your stay. We do realize our hotel is a bit tired and in need of some TLC ( and we are looking forward to full renovation coming out up very soon. I sincerely apologize for the Front desk not taking care of you properly, I will definitely speak with them and do a refresh training for the issue you mentioned so in the future they can handle it in the proper manner.Again my sincerest apologies. We thank you again for giving us the opportunity to serve you.Kind regards,Laura Benson
I anticipated this resort having interior corridors like the pictures led me to believe however it did not. The rooms were very old and definitely could use some updating and refurbishing. Outside the hotel a group of homeless people were staying by the emergency exit which did not make me feel safe at all. Not my first choice next time I'm in San Diego.
The Comfort Suites Mission San Diego was clean and the property was pleasant. 1. The pool area never got cleaned, towels and trash laid around all weekend.2. The hot tub was broke. Never saw anyone attempting to fix it.3. We asked for extra towels, the House Keeping staff knocked once then just walked right in. I thought this was odd, unprofessional and totally inappropriate. 4. House Keeping was already trying to clean our room at 8:00 am in the morning. I thought this was odd, totally inappropriate.5. I was disgusted that people were walking into the breakfast room with no shoes, adults and children alike. Not the Hotel's fault just an observation.
Arrived on a Sunday afternoon. Hotel Staff was nice upon greeting. Asked me to upgrade to a King with 2 bunk beds, but I kept the 2 double beds.The label of suite means an extra sitting room in the front with a sofa, small desk, TV, refrigerator, and microwave. The extra room made it nice for our little boy to play while we are resting in the bedroom.AC design is peculiar. Front room gets the main AC, then the room with beds is blocked by a glass sliding door. There is a fan which pulls the AC through to the bedroom. Bathroom was clean, but had a chemical smell. Carpet, wallpaper, and paint all look like they need remodel, which on the hotel website said was going to happen soon. Sliding door to bathroom does not have a lock. Nice to have 2 flat screen TVs. Bed was comfortable.We had a room in the back of the hotel, which made it quiet. The bathroom window faces a bunch of apartments, so you need to remember to close it for your privacy.Price was economical. I read the fine print about the 12 parking fee, I don't think is a big deal. However, they should create a line item in their billing before they quote the nightly price.Breakfast room was convenient and food was well stocked. I would consider going back to this hotel after the renovation. I hope they redo the AC system instead of relying on an old-fashioned fan to re-distribute the air.Dear Guest,We would like to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. Feedback from our guests is very important to us and your input helps with our continuing efforts to provide excellent service and a great stay.Thank you so much for your business and we look forward to seeing you in the future.Kind regards,Laura Benson Operations Manager Quality Suites Mission Valley (619)-881-4000
I gave them excellent rating mostly because of the people that work there were so helpful. The place is nice and the room was clean. Bed was great and I slept well every night. Quiet too even though right next to freeway. Had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. There is a Trader Joe's right across the freeway and that helped with meals. I spent the week there while I visited Comic Con and a shuttle was a few steps away from there. Also full breakfast was included. Food was good. I could not eat the cheese omelette but they looked good. Free Wifi.Dear Marie,We would like to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey.

We paid quite a bit to upgrade to a suite. Basically, it's a long narrow room with a divider between the window and the bed. The actual bedroom is very small and the sitting area is even smaller. The A/C is in the sitting area and you must keep the door open to allow cool air to flow into the bedroom. The additional daily parking fee exasperated the problem. The hotel sits next to the interstate but the noise did not seem to bother us once we were inside the room. The breakfast which was included was more than adequate.Dear RobertPC118,First of all I want to thank you for taking the time to let me know your experience. I can assure you that we will use this information to look at the room configuration since we are currently reviewing plans to upgrade the property by renovating to improve our conditions. I am glad you enjoyed the breakfast. If you decide to visit us, please contact me directly at 619.881.4001. I will personally take care of your reservation and make sure that next time you will give us ALL 5 rating!We hope to see you again soon!Art CollantesGeneral Manager
The only thing nice that we saw here was the pool, which looked clean and fresh (unfortunately, I didn't bring a suit). The place has very, very old and beat up furniture and was either too hot or too cold -- the heating systems are terrible, built under the window as in older cheap properties and then the beds are behind some sliding doors, so you have to leave those doors open if you want any cooling. The breakfast in the morning is really disgusting. They seem to have people making the breakfast who know nothing about what coffee is supposed to look like, for example, or what bacon strips look like. They had a whole container full of picnic bacon, which is just scraps of pork in no particular shape, generally used as bacon pieces for other foods. And here it is in their hot breakfast like you are supposed to dive in and just eat those bacon scraps as if they are slices of morning bacon. Not me!The coffee maker in the room saved the day for us, because it was actually much better than expected. In a general sense, this room was not the quality that we expected for what we paid, and we were generally disappointed. Complicating the situation, we asked for a wake up call at 10:06 PM one night, and they promised to call. We were never awakened and it caused some big problems. I hope the attached photos help people understand why they should avoid this property.Dear Lindaj99,Very sorry to hear you were so disappointed with us during your recent stay.our main goal is to make sure all our guest have an enjoyable stay.Sorry we fell short of your expectations. the hotel will be having a full renovation towards the end of March.We hope you will give us a chance to serve you again.Thank you again for your comments.Best Regards,Laura BensonOperations ManagerComfort Suites MV
If you need a pristine trendy hotel, with all the amenities, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for clean, comfortable lodging, and can put up with a few items that are rough around the edges, this may be the place for you. At about 70/night this place was about half to a third of some of the more modern places that are literally next door. Our modest sized room was a true suite with a door between the bedroom and the sitting area. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a big, clean bathroom. Staff were efficient and friendly. The breakfast was all we could ask for, and was generally kept well stocked. The breakfast rooms are large with lots of seating. As noted, there were some rough edges: the ventilation fans in our room were quite noisy the screen on our window was broken and the pool elevator was creaky, with a well outdated inspection report posted. The location in the valley is just off of I-8, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. We were able to get most anywhere we wanted to go to see the sights in 10-15 minutes.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your recent stay with us. We appreciate all your wonderful comments. We work very hard to keep our little hotel clean and comfortable and we are aware that it needs a lot of TLC. We are also looking forward to getting a full renovation very soon, We hope to see you back once this is done. )Thank you again for staying with us.Kind regards,Laura Benson
This hotel is just ok. The rooms are decent but nothing more. The pool is small but I guess adaquate for kids. The walls are paper thin and we were awake every night by people walking in the room above. If you want quiet choose a room on the 3rd floor and away from the pool. The complimentary breakfast is just ok also. I love my breakfast and this was not that good at all. Eggs and sausages were not edible. At least there was cereal and milk. The location is good as there are several big shopping malls around. The zoo and sea world are close also. Ralph's grocery store is also not far. You do need a car in san diego though.
You couldn't ask for a better price for a for a suite with three small rooms that includes breakfast. The total amount of space seemed similar to an Embassy Suite with parents sleeping in one room and two kids in a bunk bed in a second room that you need walk through to get to the bathroom. It is true that the AC was kind of moldy smelling and the room did feel a bit run down and the guests, in general, didn't seem real classy. The immediate location isn't exactly romantic either, but it is well located for driving places in San Diego. The breakfast, by the way, was surprisingly good. If you are used to decent hotels, it will be hard to feel comfortable at this one, and I don't think you would choose this place for a honeymoon. Still, for around 100, I don't think you could find a better value for a quick overnight stay in a suite for a family of four.
This place was a breath of fresh air. After traveling for 6 weeks we needed a hotel that could offer laundry facilities, fridge, coffee making, breakfast etc... it has it all. The reception and housekeeping staff were all very friendly, even had fresh coffee and crisp red apples at reception. Frederick at front desk was happy to recommend local restaurants and attractions. Although the rooms are a bit dated it had a great comfy bed and a separate lounge. The daily breakfast was fabulous. It even had a hot dish to offer each day. I would highly recommend this hotel to any couple wanting a value for money stay. Dear guest,Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to serve you. We thank you for all your wonderful comments and look forward to seeing you again soon.Kind regards,
My family and I (2 kids 2 adults) stayed at Quality Suites San Diego Sea World Area in early Oct 2018. We stayed in a king size room with a pull out sofa bed. The king bed was very comfy but the pull out sofa wasnt comfy for the kids and wouldnt be able to accommodate an adult. You would be better to get another bedding configuration. The pull out sofa bed was in an offset room/sitting area (with a separate tv) that can be closed with a glass sliding door. The full room is compact so if you have very big bags, they wouldnt be able to be left open all the time as you probably couldnt walk past them. The kids loved the pool, and we could here a little bit of noise from where we were but not much (we were on the 3rd floor in the far corner so it was the quietest area). The breakfast and breakfast area was good. The staff were friendly and the location was central to the zoo and the airport. We used Lyft to go places. You could go across the highway to the mission valley shopping area but we didnt do that. There is a Dennys, petrol station, benihana, Wendys and another food place within several minutes walk (and a Wendys further) on the hotel side of the highway. Overall we had a good stay as it provided everything we needed for our couple of nights.Dear Guest - We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such candid feedback of your stay. I am very sorry to hear that your stay did not meet expectations. At the same time glad to know that kids loved the pool and you liked the breakfast! I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as well. Looking forward to welcoming you back soon!
Nice lush landscaping, nice pool. Close to freeways and gas station. Stayed in room 315. The kids liked having their own space. Hard to take a shower, no or low pressure. Air conditioner didn't seem to be working. I called front desk, girl said they hadn't had any complaints! Seriously I'm calling! Was so hot for 3 nights! There was a stand up fan so I assumed they knew the AC wasn't working. Breakfast was blah. Make sure you have time because the breakfast area was packed and they take FOREVER to replenish the hot foods. Overall, my stay was fine. Kids were happy. Dear AlexLisa02,Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to share your comments.I would like to apologize to you and your family on behalf of the hotel for failing to meet your needs.We understand our hotel is in need of a LOT of TLC, so sorry (We are due for a full renovation in the next couple of months in which we'll have everything in those rooms replaced and upgraded.i hope you will give us a chance to serve you again very soon.Warm regards,Laura Benson OP ManagerComfort Suites MV
The location was perfect, close to Sea World since that was where we were headed. Lots of restaurants on University avenue just a mile from the hotel. Parking was convenient and free.We booked the suites since we were 5 of us. The beds were comfortable ( though I found them a little soft ). Still had a good nights rest. The bedrooms and the living room had a partition. Chairs table and a work station were in the living room. Our room overlooked the jacuzzi.The faucet in the bathroom definitely need work. It was tricky to figure out warm and cold since they worked in oopposite directions. Once we got it it was easy. I found the bathroom tiles like those found in a garden. had to use my slippers as they really hurt once out from the bath tub. We asked for the sheets not be changed. Liked their way of saving the environment. Requested for the towels to be changed.I wish the management had extra soaps since there were 5 people staying in the suite. We didnt have the time to go and request this.. We always carry some incase of instances where there aren't any. Breakfast was rrealy really good.. sausages, 2 types of eggs, cold and hot breakfast. There were tables and chairs inside as well as outside. Lots of place to sit. When depparting i needed some hot water. Couldnt find any in the coffee area, so the front desk requested the breakfast room door to be opened to assist my request. Thought this was really nice. Will definitely stay here again even though we found some glitches here and there. The price for the 2 night stay was perfect.
The hotel is nice, the bunk bed room is the best for a family. Our kids were so excited to have their own room and bunk beds. The pool and hottub were fun too. Breakfast is decent too. But what sold me is the customer service! I will go back. I left a very expensive toy realized it after a 10 hour drive home. They were SO HELPFUL, housekeeping, front desk, everyone. I just got it in the mail less than a week after our stay. THANK YOU COMFORT SUITES!We sincerely appreciate your feedback that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us so much. I am happy your children enjoyed their stay with us too, in their own part of your room with their special bunk beds! Many of our guests with children state the bunk beds combined with their own area make the children feel very at ease while traveling. Our staff is also very pleased that you mentioned them in your review too. Often the things they do to ensure our guests have a pleasant stay are done in the background and not always noticed by our guests, so it was very rewarding for them to see your comments. We were only too glad that we found the item you left in your room and that were able to return it to you safely. We are honored that you value our staff and commitment to customer service and we look forward to you staying with us again in the future. Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming
Towels are yellow and gray, wallpaper is dirty and marked, room is musty and smelly, carpet looks 30 years old, furniture is mismatched, scuffed, phones are old, the building is old and falling apart. The only nice area was the lobby.V C,I apologize our property was not to your standards and that out staff failed to accomadate you during your stay. I will go over this review with my staff to help us all improve on these little details. We are currently working on renovating and improving a lot of things in our property. I hope we have not loss your business and you may consider giving us a second chance. We would like to see you visit us again in the near future!Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Sincerly,Laura Benson
This is my second stay at this location and due to it's price of under 100.00 it fits my budget. On my first stay the room was spotless, unfortunately this time around I can see that they just ripped out the old TV's because there is particle board shaving from the entertainment center all over the furniture and part of the carpet...the good news is brand new flat screen..the bad news is that the front desk told me that there were no remote controls for the new HDTV's and you could not change the channels...it was programmed on the welcome screen. So the rooms are worn with sagging couches nicked and torn wall paper, old furniture and brand new HDTV's that are useless...I think I'll look elsewhere on my next business trip to San Diego. I am a Platinum Choice Hotels member and stayed over 25 nights with Comfort Suites across the Western US last year and this is not the standard of every other CS I have stayed at..this should be a Comfort Inn.
As with most Mission Valley area hotels, the location is good.The rooms are very aged. Definitely time for some refurbishing (which I think is happening soon). The morning breakfast is pretty nice with a good variety of foods for everyone.Parking is pretty tight if you get there late. Parking in the back is really hard with a larger vehicle. As with other Mission Valley hotels, not sure why they charge for parking other than adding on some extra bucks to their pockets. If you are family looking for included breakfast and don't mind roughing it just a bit, this is the place for you, if you can get a good rate.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to leave us honest and detailed feedback on your last stay with us. We appreciate you taking the time to comment on the hotel and amenities we offer to our guests. Very glad to here you enjoyed your stay and our hot breakfast. We always try to provide the best customer service to our valued guest.We hope to have you visit us again soon! Warm Regards,Laura BensonOperations Manager619-881-4004
The room was not bad and it was a family room with two separate rooms. The refrigerator did not work and we had to call maintenance. He didn't fix it but we ended up fixing it- because it was wired up weird. We had fans in the room but there was no place to plug them in which was a little strange. There was an open granola bar left on the floor from the last guest that I guess housekeeping missed a couple of days in a row. The hotel was not a bad price but was still not really worth the price we paid. Breakfaste was average and very crowded every morning.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to give us feedback on your stay with us in May. We appreciate the feedback and will be passing down all information to the correct departments to provided better service to all future guests. I apologize for any inconvience to you and your family. I am glad you enjoyed the set up of our rooms and breakfast. I hope we do get to see you back soon. If there is anything I may do to make your next stay with us GREAT, Please email me at laura.bensoninterstate.comWarm RegardsLaura Benson619-881-4004
Comfort Suite Mission Valley was in a great location for our plans. Housekeeping did a terrific job keeping the room clean and comfortable. The building needed some work especially on flooring by the second story stair case. Parking was definitely limited and we were unaware of a parking fee per day until checking in, that really hit a nerve. Despite that we really enjoyed our stay and the comfort it provided.We are glad that you enjoyed our clean comfortable rooms along with the great location of the hotel. Sorry that you missed on the parking fee information, we display it on all the channels to make sure that guest is aware of it.

Overall, a great place to stay. Area is east of Hotel Circle with less congestion easier freeway access. Stayed on the ground floor, steps from the pool and breakfast room. The room was a small suite that appeared to have been recently remodeled with 2 flat screen tv's, fridge, microwave, separate living area with a sofa bed, queen bed in the bedroom and a large bathroom. One of the best free hot breakfast buffets we've ever encountered. Huge serving area, separate dining area for approximately 40 people and an additional outside patio seating area. We stayed on a weekend and no lines for breakfast. Be aware that the hotel charges 12 a day for parking (lot is very large). At less than 75 a night on a weekend, this hotel is definitely a keeper!Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us. We work very hard to make sure all of our guest have an enjoyable and restful visit. We are very glad to hear that we were able to exceed your expectation.We truly look forward to serving you again soon.Thank you again for staying with us.Warm regards,Laura Benson
First, make sure you are booking the hotel you want. There is another Comfort Inn (Zoo / SeaWorld area) nearby and it has a better rating than this one. At this one we reserved a kid's suite, however, they do not seem to have a room as pictured on the website w/kid's bunkbed. So you buy a room and get another one that is dirty and smells bad. The staff at the reception is courteous, but the cleaning people seem to make a special effort to make you feel uncomfortable.
My family and I checked in on Thursday 9/21 around 9pm. The parking lot was very small and hard to get a spot. When we finally got in the lobby, it looked clean and presentable. Our room was an entirely different story. It was facing outside by the pool. The light was already on in our room before we entered. Once we got in I was immediately disgusted. It smelled horrible (almost like a really bad sulfur), room looked very outdated and unappealing. Room was small, beds were old and I was so grossed out. I went to the front desk and explained how disappointed I was and they let me look at a few other rooms they offered--all of them terrible. We stayed put as there was no sense in moving to another awful room and quickly went to bed. When I woke up the next morning there were TWO cockroaches in the bathroom. YUCK! Southern California, I get it, bugs can happen. Every other hotel we stayed at for the rest of the week was so lovely. Very clean, up to date, and well kept. We had a few other family members that stayed in different rooms at this hotel and they were all equally displeased. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. It ran me 135 after 12 for parking. We had 3 more rooms reserved at this hotel again for that Sunday but we canceled them immediately. Gross, outdated, smelly, and OVERPRICED. Never again will I stay at this hotel! BUYER BEWARE. Also, when I checked out of the hotel, the man at the desk asked me how everything was. I told him You don't want to know and the didn't have any response...not a sorry, to hear that, nothing..Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Nice comfortable motel. Bed was comfortable, room was clean, breakfast was wonderful. Some noise heard through the walls from other tenants, but not a big problem. Costs we're reasonable and we would stay there again given the chance.Dear cewilk2, Thank you for staying with us. We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

I recently stayed at this property as it was listed as a three-diamond under AAA ratings and had bunk beds for my two young children. This hotel is not as nice as advertised. The room I had showed its age as it was looking dirty and worn. I also had one of the worst experiences I have ever had with the hotel personnel and management. Their customer service was very poor. On the second night of our stay the Toilet backed up a around 8:30 P.M. I called the front desk and was told there was no one who could fix it so I could move to another room. I declined this, as it would have taken at least an hour and a half to pack up, move, unpack and set up the room. My children were just going to bed so moving and doing the work would have been quite intrusive. I couldnt believe that they didnt have anyone who could plunge the toiled as this hotel has over 125 rooms. I asked if they had a plunger and the desk person stated he would look. He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable, as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused, and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger. I told her she should be embarrassed about the customer service, she advised that she was proud of it and all of her employees. I asked for information on the ownership of the hotel, or her manager. She only would give me the choice 1-800 number. She actually stated that she didnt have that information. I asked for the name of who hired her she stated herself, I asked if she was the owner. She again would only say she didnt have that information. Earlier I had asked for compensation for the situation she insulting only offered to pay for the plunger. In the room was a card titled commitment to your Satisfaction, It stated states that if youre not satisfied with our accommodations or service, please the front desk know so we can make it right. At this property from the general manager on down they do not follow this policy. They definitely did not make it right.
I recently visited the area for Spring Break. This location was perfect. Close to all of the major attractions (Petco Park, Sea World, SD Zoo, etc). We were very close to the interstate but the location was very quiet. Shopping centers, movie theater, and numerous restaraunts nearby. We had issues checking in and the room type we booked was not available the first night. We were put in a smaller room but we did get a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Breakfast included hot items but they left a bit to be desired but my kids loved the make your own waffles (get there early or prepare to stand in line for quite a while). The outdoor heated pool/hot tub area was nice and well stocked with towels. The rooms were a bit tight (family suites) but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. There are lots of families that stay here so there was constant noise from children running the corridors so if you are looking for peace and quiet this might not be for you. Overall a nice stay despite a few issues.We are glad that you liked the location of the hotel which is very close to all the attractions, walking distance shopping mall and restaurants. Thank you very much for appreciating heated pool. We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback.See you when you will visit Sunny San Diego again!!!Sincerely,Sarika DesaiAssistant General ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area619-881-4000
We had two rooms for one night here, just staying over with some family after a college graduation ceremony. It was Memorial weekend, so understandably full of lots of families with younger children. The rooms were clean I appreciate the sheets covering the blanket and the fitted bottom sheet on the bed. Two areas in the room separated by glass doors. Two TV's, wi-fi, small frig and microwave:) Our internet rate was very reasonable for the area, especially considering it was a suite. They do charge 8 for parking most we have stayed at in the Hotel Circle area don't. The downtown hotels in San Diego almost all charge for parking, and charge a lot more. This is a pretty central location to get to all of San Diego's attractions. The breakfast was fairly standard, but is a good convenience to have to get something to eat in the AM before taking off to do touristy things.We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to submit your nice comments about your recent stay with us. We are glad you and your family enjoyed our suites with two separate living/sleeping areas and all their standard extra features. A survey of competing hotels in our immediate area found most do have a parking charge as we do, but we feel our competitive rates, unique room suites, and central location more than offset this. It is nice to know you enjoyed our free breakfast buffet. We are constantly adding new items and try to offer changing daily selections. Many of our guests also like that they can choose to eat in the breakfast room or on the adjoining patio overlooking the pool. We hope you had the opportunity to enjoy both and that you will choose to say with us again on your next visit. Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming, General Manager

I recently stay at this hotel the weekend before Thanksgiving, and I had a few problems. I believe the best way for a hotel to do better is to let them know whats wrong. Overall I thought the hotel was nice and the staff was very helpful and this is good. There were a few hiccups, but I would probably stay again. (only if they fix the problems below)When I arrived Saturday afternoon, after my 4 hour drive, I really wanted to sit in the hot tub. I was told that it was not open due to some maintenance that needed to be done on both the pool and hot tub. I then tried to go into the hot tub the next morning and again was told it was not open and that it might be open later in the afternoon. I came back Sunday evening and it was raining, but the hot tub was finally open. So I sat in there while the rain came down and hit my face (not good and not long). Next I noticed the hotel had very nice flat screen T.V.'s in all the rooms that my family occupied. There was also HBO booklets next to the T.V.'s....only one problem. They did not have HBO or premium channels until the following weekend.. So I had to sit in a room with basic cable and no HBO or even the FX or History Channel. The breakfast was ok, but after the 2nd day I ate off site. The eggs were really watery and the sausage was as dry as beef jerky. The Orange Juice machine seemed to get worse each day, and on my third day it was like orange water. The elevator was extremely slow, and I think I could have walked up to my third floor faster. The elevators needed to be faster.
This hotel is located in the Hotel circle area of San Diego. Please note being a San Diego resident, this hotel is not close to the downtown / gaslamp area or tourist attractions of San Diego. You are a good 15 / 20 minute cab ride to downtown. Most people stay at these hotels to be near the shopping malls. You will need a car to get around out here, the freeways around hotel circle are all over the place.The room itself is clean and big, but a little dated and the old wooden furniture could use a change, but understand that this hotel is more towards the budget end of hotels in San Diego, so its very decent for the price and surround by other hotels with a La Quinta property right next door.The breakfast is your average one with choices of bread, muffins and some scrambled eggs and sausage, coffee, or make yourself a waffle and some yogurts are available.The bed was pretty comfortable and i felt safe in my room and could not hear any noise from the neighbors. It's also nice you have a lounge area in your room to watch tv and relax and be away from the bedroom. The room also has a fridge and a microwave in them.Overall this is a good location if you need to be in Mission valley.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for leaving our property positive feedback on your recent stay with us. I am very glad to hear you enjoy our suites and all amenties we have to offer. Our central location to all major attractions is a plus but for some it is about 20 minutes out, which i think is still not to bad. Our Hotel recently changed names from Comfort Suites to Quality Suites. In doing so most items in the bed rooms have been replaced with new products from bedding, mattresses and a few others. Between now and March 2015 we should have all renovations complete. We hope to have you visit us again in the near future. Thank you again for the great feedback! Warm Regards,Laura BensonOperations Mananger619-881-4004
We have just finished our trip here and all was perfect for my family (we have two children of 4 and 5 years old). We chose a king suite. The king bed was really comfortable. The room is tiny but there is so much to do in San Diego that we did not have to stay in the room other than to sleep. Perfect breakfast. Perfect pool and hot tub. Clean. The only negative point is that the hotel is not really eco friendly... plastic glass, plastic utensils....Well situated (need a car).Dear Marie - Wow! What a wonderful review, we truly appreciate your business and your trust in us. I am very happy to hear that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us and also enjoyed our complimentary deluxe hot breakfast. We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel in the near future. Take care! :)
We stayed here for one night with our 2 young kids. As mentioned in other reviews, some of the suites are quite small, although some of that is probably just due to having a divider in the middle of the two parts. It was nice having a divider between us and the kids, even if it was just a clear door. The one suggestion I would make to improve the property would be to have either clouded glass or curtains over the glass part of the doors so that they're not completely transparent. That way you can still watch TV after the kids have gone to bed without worrying about waking them up.While the rooms show some use, the property has been kept up well. The pool was clean and heated and there are some nice areas for eating outside in the perfect San Diego weather. The hotel is about 10 minutes from Sea World, Mission Bay, and downtown,so its a quick jump to everywhere, although the downside is that nowhere is within walking distance. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were very accommodating when we requested a crib for the room and, after we left one of our phone chargers, they went to our room and called us when they had found it. Service like that is what makes this hotel go from just average to very good.Overall, this hotel is a solid choice, as long as you don't mind driving to the local attractions. Also, just as a tip, there's a parking fee for parking in the lot, however, you can park on the steet for free, as long as you can find a spot.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Art CollantesGeneral ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley(619)-881-4000
It looks decent from the outside but the rooms are dingy and dirty. We were on the second floor and heard EVERY step the people took above us! We also woke up to water under the sink seeping onto the bathroom floor! We gave it a try but we are moving on to another hotel today! DISAPPOINTEDWe are extremely sorry that our suites was not up to your expectations. Usually people who had stayed in the area do find our room more spacious and Comfortable compare to other hotels in the area and especially find good valued suites. They find it is indulging that they have 2 rooms with 2 TVs microwave and fridge. Our beautiful tropical landscaping is very favorite with guest and we have happy repeat guests. Sorry we could not surpass your expectations.We hope that after staying with other hotel may be you will find good value in our hotel and consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Sincerely,Sarika DesaiAssistant General ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area619-881-4000
The staff was the other best thing about this hotel. They were very friendly and efficient, getting our keys replaced (twice), killing the ants eating my birthday cake and clearing the stopped up toilet.This is an older hotel, but the price is reasonable, it was clean and it has a great location near downtown and a mega shopping center. The rooms have some wear, but were roomy with a bedroom and sitting room. There was also free wi-fi, breakfast, computer room, refrigerator, micro and pool. Parking was 12. per night.Nice place if you're not too picky and can keep a sense of humor.Dear guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your resent stay with us. We are so glad to hear we were able to meet your needs and expectations. looking forward to seeing you back again soon. thank you again for your wonderful comments. )Kind regards,Laura Benson
Hungry They got you covered evening and breakfast.. comfy bed, quiet. Pool and Hot Tub both nice. The Air worked great and there was an option to leave the fan on all night. Clean and spacious room. Would stay again
Hampton inns are my favorite hotel to stay at no matter where I go. If there is a hampton to choose, that is my pick every time. They are clean and comfortable and they have the BEST beds. Their breakfast is great too. Dressed up oatmeal is my favorite. They took away the to go bowls, but I improvise and... More
The Hampton in Heritage Square offered us a high quality night's stay. The restaurants surrounding the hotel were plentiful and varied. Beds are always comfortable at a Hampton. I would highly recommend this Hampton.
I was out in Indiana for a get together and the Hampton being my go to hotel I stayed at this one. There was an odd smell to the building while I was checking in and it lingered all the way up to the 3rd floor where my room was. Once in my room though I couldn't smell it. The... More
Place is so dirty and not well kept, but what got me the most is how unprofessional the night auditor was!!! He had such a bad attitude I even said to cancel my reservation cause I didn't care for his attitude. After I said that he immediately worked on my reservation faster and made sure I stayed, so I did.... More
This has to be by far the nastiest and unkempt hotel I have ever seen! There were stains on everything...The shower curtain, chairs, wall and bed spread. Some of the staff was very rude.... Not to mention the power outlets have electrical burns and a prong was stuck in a ground plug outlet. Nothing that is claimed in the description... More
Last Saturday, we arrived on time and had paid through Hotels.com. Their is a wall-high GLASS that separates the customer from the check in clerks (first clue). The clerk was extremely slow and after 15 mins, still could not find our paid reservation on her computer. Meanwhile,a man walked in without a reservation, got a room and key and was... More
If you stay here you are either desperate or have no where else to turn. This hotel is very aged in dire need of maintenance, cleaning, or needs to be condemned. As free wifi but did not work. Hotel smells of smoke with a very seedy crowd around it at all times of the night. Do not recommend this hotel... More
Two and 1/2 blocks to Union Square, two blocks to San Francisco Shopping Center and BART two blocks to the Cable Car line a good location for shopping and sightseeing. Smallish room--tastefully appointed with touches I've seen in high-end hotels--was cozy and comfortable. It's in the heart of downtown, so we expected to hear city sounds from the room, but we slept well and comfortably in a room overlooking the street. The crowning grace, though, was the excellent and helpful staff. We forgot to make dinner reservations and was out shopping, but a call to the concierge got us an 8pm table on Saturday night in a highly-rated restaurant. The front desk staff was uniformly friendly, interested in helping us enjoy our stay, and full of useful not-in-the-guidebooks information. We'd return to the hotel without hesitation.
Location of hotel was walking distance to AT T park, and walking distance to local transportation and shops. Staff was very friendly and helpful, Rooms, were clean and comfortable, ours was a little on the small size but comfortable.
Front desk has an excellent customer service, good price for a downtown hotel which is near to all restaurants and shops. Great staff however room is really small and you can hear next door. No views
I understand that it is quite likely a great improvement over years past, however the refresh is superficial only. The floors still creak and were bowed and the climate control is minimal. The provided window air conditioner has not been serviced in some time and the air was not cool. I'm also concerned that the shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are not properly secured. I feel like someone had contaminated the shampoo, as it had a terrible smell, which unfortunately I did not discover until after I had it in my hair. The attached restaurant is well above average for the area and is the only redeeming quality in my opinion. The restaurant hours could be improved for in-house guestsHello fastboxter, please accept my sincere apology if we failed your standards during your stay. Our goal is make sure that guest experience is satisfactory and enjoyable. I have shared your comment with department managers in charge so we can improve and make the necessary changes. Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.
Great location! Within steps to shopping and restaurants. We had a problem with our coffee maker but it was quickly replaced. Only negative thing about our stay was the valet rate was pricey but I guess that's the norm for San Francisco.Greetings 763christinap, thank you for giving us a 5 star rating. We are pleased to know that your shopping trip and stay at the Abri was successful. Stay vibrant!
Our room was extremely cramped and the hotel is in need of TLC. I can tell that the hotel is making serious strides towards improvement and the staff is seriously the highlight of the entire stay. They are wonderful and made us feel welcome during our entire stay. Besides the cleanliness factor in both the room and common areas, my biggest complaint is the bathroom has no countertop space. I love my toiletries and styling products and there was no place to put either. I ended up almost catching the room on fire because there is no counter space or even an edge of the sink in which to put my curling iron. I dropped my curling iron several times on the floor and it fell into the toilet at one point (hence the sparks and almost fire).Hi Ms. Adena B, I am sorry to hear that the room you stayed at was a little small for you. Please know for future stay that if you book direct with us, we can give you a complimentary upgrade to one of our urban suites (based on availability). We value your feedback and hoped that we can make it up to you in the near future. Stay vibrant!
I have stayed at all the big hotels in the Union Square (Westin, Hyatt, Hilton, etc ) and a number of boutique offerings as well. This may be my favorite one. The valueIs by far the best in the area. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and the vibe is casual/chic. Huge thumbs up!
A wonderful hotel in a great location. The staff at the hotel go beyond the call of duty to be helpful. The rooms are small but very well equipped. The beds are very comfortable. This hotel is a real gem and I can highly recommend it.
The hotel was very clean. The staff are all nice . Situated very near shopping malls restaurants. They have great deals you can avail at an affordable price. We had a spacious room with a king bed and a sofa bed and 2 flat TV sets. There was plenty of space to roam around. Hello MariaLorenaR, thank you giving us a 5 star rating. We are delighted to know that we were able to meet your expectations. Please come and see us again in the near future! Stay vibrant!
We stayed at the Monticello Inn for Labor Day weekend. We were 2 couples each with our own room. Upon arrival we were promptly attended to and checked in quickly. Vallet took our vehicle and we headed up to our room. The street it is located on is (Ellis) runs into Powell which is the main street the Trolleys run up and down. This hotel is located in Union Square, your really are in the middle of a great shopping center! Each side you walk you've got shops Adidas, Puma, Bloomingdale's, etc etc! A+ for Location!Once we entered our room, the only negative thing about this whole expreience was the smell of Freshly baked Subway Bread! Ha ha, I believe because of the way the hotel is built the center subway is one level with it's vents on there roof, there roof is also the first floor of the 5 story or so hotel, so it vents into the shaft of sorts and straight into your a/c unit. Big woop! Seeing as we don't like to hibernate in our room when this city is alive, it didn't bother us one bit, except when you woke up in the morning crazy a sandwhich (he he). We reserved a one Bedroom Suite. Upon entering it we were surprised to see how roomy it was. You first enter a living room with a miniature refrigerator, big enough to fit a 2-liter and some can drinks. The Tv is a good sized tv, everything is clean and neat. The couch is comfy as well as the Chair. They have these gorgeous Bay windows with seats built all around it so you can absorb the light if you so choose, cause there isn't much of a view! The bedroom is completley seperate from the living room, there is a door that divides it ( not too common with suites) The decor is exactly as it appears on the website, the stripes look overbearing at first but they are not I assure you! The bed was very comfterble, the sheets where clean. It was very pleasant. The bathroom had a Shower tub Combo, clean as well, no rust or grime build up. This room was a perfect gathering space for us and our friends, seeing as they had gotten a standard room I did look at it and it was very spacious as well. Enjoy the Pictures and the hotel, it is in an incredible location!
I always have a free bed in SF, so paying for a hotel bed seems odd, but I was here on business. If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend.Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job.Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead.The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth. There is a popular restaurant attached to the hotel. I did not eat there (spendy), but it attracted a solid crowd in a neighborhood with a lot of competition. There are, of course, a ton of delicious places nearby and it is also around the same corner to the Powell St. Muni/Bart stations. If I came to SF for business again, I would consider staying here eventhough my worksite was not nearby.
The Abri is a nice boutique hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent. A couple blocks from Market St. I stayed during the Salesforce conference and I was happy to be in a quieter property that was close to all the major venues. The only very minor negative is the rooms were slightly on the smaller side. Or at least the room I had was. But the room was nicely appointed and it was similar to a hotel room you would get in Europe. Room size for me was entirely acceptable and did not make my stay any less comfortable. I would absolutely stay there again as I prefer boutique hotels versus the large chains. It's a nicely run and comfortable property.
We came into the city to celebrate our 25th Anniversary and stayed at the Hotel Abri. We both thought it was wonderful! Great location, great room, fantastic service with attention to detail!
My husband and I stayed six nights of their deluxe double room. This hotel was super convenient. Turn right within five minutes walk is the cable car and all the famous U.S. department stores, like Bloomingdale and Norstrom which are inside the big Westfield shopping mall, Walgreen, the supermarket is just in the neighbouhood. There is a Chinese restaurant and a Sushi place just cross the road. I love the bed in Hotel Abri, there were four medium size pillows on it and the bed was very comfortable. The room was very small but everything was in it, also the bathroom was very small, too. The air-condiitioning was the old-fashioned window ones, very noisy. It depends on what you are looking for, for location, this should be a good choice, everything is within walking distance and there is no need to rent a car because parking is very expensive in downtown San Francisco, valet parking in this hotel cost you US50 a day!The elevator was a bit scary, recommended to hold 4 persons! I saw some people choose to use the stairs. All the staffs were very friendly. There was free Wifi but it also depends what time, at night it is super-slow. My room was very quiet because I read the comments before booking this hotel, make sure you ask for the interior room and higher floors. There was a funny smell in the hallway but not inside the room. All in all, I think this hotel worth the money and if I want to stay in San Francisco downtown, I would surely book Hotel Abri again.
I came in for a wedding and wanted to be in the heart of it all. It is a beautiful place and I shall return. The hotel was pricey for the amount of space and amenities but the I enjoyed everything else. Will return for a longer stay with friends to explore more and do more!
We booked this hotel through priceline several years ago and got a fantastic deal - around 70/night. It's small and a bit faded but it had charm and the location is fantastic. It's a lot more fun than paying the same price or more to stay at a motor lodge on Lombard street.
From the door service man to the front desk personnel to the maid service, ALL is excellent customer service at this Hotel Abri in San Francisco. All the employees are very kind and friendly, and are willing to do everything to make you happy. I spoke with the manager as well, and he was very kind and willing to talk to us to make sure we had an excellent stay. If I ever get back to San Francisco, I will stay at the Hotel Abri again. It's in a great location 1 block from Union Square.
The location and price of this hotel were exactly what we wanted...1 block from the BART and 2 blocks from Union Square. The hotel is very well managed, clean, and comfortable. Great showers and comfortable beds. We weren't in the hotel much as we were on a vacation and were busy running around but we looked forward to coming home to our hotel each night and finding dinner at all the local restaurants. It's centrally located to everything you'll want to see. We're very frugal people so we vetted many, many hotels. And finally settled on this one. So glad we did! Anytime we go back to San Francisco (which now we want to make a regular thing out of it) we want to stay at Hotel Abri. We even looked into their enrollment program to earn free nights...and we never do that. When we were initially debating whether to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area or Union Square, we ultimately decided we wanted to be in the city...not a tourist attraction, so we went with Union Square. It was great to visit touristy areas but come back to local life. That said, Union Square is a huge shopping mecca so you could argue that its a commercial area. But the vibe feel much more local. This hotel is like staying Union Square in NY versus sleeping in Time Square...exactly how we wanted to experience San Fran.
The hotel is in a good location and the restaurant had excellent food. Rooms are a bit on the small side, but still very comfy and adequate for my needs. It was clean and the staff was very nice and helpful. It's a great hotel for nonsmokers, but would not recommend it for smokers as there are no outdoor facilities and the location makes it nearly impossible to accommodate.
Great hotel in the middle of everything San Francisco. I walked to world class dining and shopping. A couple of blocks from Chinatown and around the corner was the cable car, municipal buses, and the BART. I parked my car with the valet and didn't use it again until I checked out.The staff was genuine, friendly, and helpful. Sitting in the lobby with coffee and the morning paper was a joy.I want to know how and why the hotel smells like cookies, except in my room, which smelled fresh and clean.It was fun and restful, a hard combination to achieve.
Stayed as part of our honeymoon trip for 3 nights. Checked about 10pm, wasnt the most friendly of greetings but hey. Had requested a high floor room, would have been nice to be wished a happy honeymoon but never mind. Asked when checking in if we had to pay for a safe or if it was in the room as we had a lot of flight tickets, money, credit cards, passports, iPads etc with it being a long trip, told it was in the room. Got to the room, no safe, rang down and spoke to the guy who checked us in who said oh yeah there is no safe in that room, a bit exhausting after a long flight from NY. Moved rooms which was fine, a bit small so no space for our luggage but a good spacious bathroom and the room was modern and clean. Reception staff quite disappointing, I have worked in hospitality and it wouldnt take much to say:- youve obviously just arrived, do you need help with eating tonight - we had never been to the city and being 10pm at night were unsure of where to go- we dont serve breakfast, do you need some recommendations- (when checking out with 4 suitcases) do you need a taxiNot much of an effort to help make our stay a little easierGood location, nice hotel, few niggles let it down
Good location. Excellent staff. The customer service is the reason to stay here. The restaurant doesn't serve breakfast, which was a draw back. But there are several good breakfast places in the area.Hello C4063RCerikag, thank you for staying at the Hotel Abri and for giving us a 4 star rating. We appreciate your time to write about your stay with us and hope that you will visit us again in the near future. Stay vibrant!
The hotel Abri is a hotel that has been renovated very well. The building itself is old but the inside is modern and decorated in a boutique style.I booked this hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor and the location. We were staying in SFR for 3 days so wanted to be close to Union Square, which we were. The hotel room we booked was a suite as we travelled with 2 children. The room was fine, clean, modern. Slightly small, but we were in the room very little so it wasnt a priority for us.The staff at the hotel are friendly and very helpful. Ruben will get anything done for you and always with a smile. It does make the difference to be greeted by name and have happy and helpful hotel staff around you.The hotel has a restaurante and bar attached to it... Open to the public and with a good italian/american menu and an excellent atmosphere.There are 3 things that are worth mentioning I think:1. The hotel only has 5 floors so you will hear plenty of street noise etc.2. The windows are small and the aircon/fan units are noisy. Although we didnt really need them very much.3. There is no breakfast available during the week, but there is room service available from 11am onwards. (there are great breakfast places very close to the hotel - Masons was excellent)
For San Francisco prices, the Hotel Abri was excellent....friendly people, clean and nicely appointed rooms with an EXCELLENT location. Lots of entertainment and restaurants in walking distance. I recommend this hotel without reservation.
Was travelling down to San Francisco on business and booked two hotel rooms at the last minute - all paid and confirmed...or so we thought. We showed up in a rush between meetings and the front desk informed us that we didn't have rooms any more because the people staying in our rooms had extended their stay! Hotel was supposed to find us rooms elsewhere but we ended up scrambling to find two other rooms. Disappointed as we always like to try and find the hidden jewel but this time we certainly found something else. Guess squatters rights still exist in San Francisco!Dear Nathan M-Let me first say that I appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback following your recent experience with us. Secondly, let me apologize and say that I wish that we were able to have accomodated you and your colleague at the Hotel Abri. Not being able to honor a reservation for a guest is the least desireable and most difficult situation for the hotel as well as the guest. We had a group of rooms extend that caused us a bit of a situation. I believe that when you arrived we were in the middle of securing accomodations for you at a neighboring hotel, but I understand how disappointing this was as you had already picked the Abri and we were unable to welcome you in the way we wish we could have. I hope that when your travels return you to San Francisco, you will give us a second chance. Please feel free to contact me or the hotel directly for future reservations, as we have a lowest rate guarantee, and always offer the lowest rate available thru any booking channel. Thanks again for your feedback!Yours in hospitality-Rob BrehantGeneral Managerrob.brehantmetwestterra.com
It was amazing to visit San Francisco at Hotel Abri in the fall and enjoy the fantastic room, shopping, convention, restaurants and hospitality, for its price its like finding a treasure The hotel is an excellent one and we have experienced a nice time. Every time we entered the hotel, we were greeted with a homely reception. This was our first Abri experience and we were very impressed with the room, hotel and your staff. Indy Shrestha, hotel Manager was incredible and went above and beyond the customer service level. After long days and nights it was truly a joy to come back to the comfort of the room. Definitely, we will be back again.
Our stay was good though not without issues. We found first a very small room one that fits a lonely kid. Then it was changed to a larger one, which yet was too small for a couple. Then we changed the third time - this time we received a comfortable suit. Overall, the hotel is old a far from meeting standards of current architecture and design. This has to do with everything, from bed to lights, from toilet to size. Staff was very friendly and helpful and tried the best to fulfill our (rather modest) requests.
Positives: around the corner from the Hyde-Powell cable car turnaround, although the lines can be lone there. Great happy hour at the hotel bar, best deals on Monday and Tuesday with a terrific bar staff. Walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and ATT Park.Negatives: dated rooms, moldy bathroooms, limited storage, noisy on occasion, missed wake up calls, car valet delays.
We felt very welcome when we arrived. The room was way to small. Probably won't stay at this location again because of the room size. Also the water pressure in the shower was awful. Felt like the price didn't match what we recieved. The staff was exceptional and very helpful.
My mother and I came to San Francisco for vacation and enjoyed our four night stay at the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and we appreciated the welcome bag with water snacks and red wine. The room was small and the bathroom very tiny but the beds were comfortable and everything was clean. Decor of the hotel was nice and the location was perfect, close to lots of shopping, cable car rides and attractions. We did not eat in the restaurant even though they gave us dining vouchers because we did not find the menu appealing Greetings SGCanda84, thank you for giving us a 4 star rating. We are glad to know that your stay with us was comfortable. We value your opinion so I've shared your comment with the restaurant managers so they can revisit our current menu. Thank you for staying at the Hotel Abri. please come and see us again in the near future. Stay vibrant!
A lovely hotel and in a great central location just a few minutes walk from Union Square and close to the Cable Cars. The rooms very clean and the shower you could have fitted at least 4 people in it. We will definatley stay there again next time we visit San Fran.
My husband and I stayed 4 nights in an upgraded King size room, with a living room, which was comfortable and perfect! We had a great rate, and the hotel is in the perfect location for the theatre, shopping, cable car, and hopping on the train to get just about anywhere. I can't say enough about the front desk staff, who were so helpful and friendly. They provided great tourist tips, and even went out of their way to find us tickets to a sold out concert. Hotel Albri was absolutely perfect, and if we are back in SF, we will definitely stay there again.
Cute suits sneakers outfits on the staff and the front desk! Very cheerful housekeeping folks (I hope they're union /or paid well with good bennies pensions!). Very comfortable beds with heaps of pillows. A good amount of space in the bathroom and bedroom. Location is extremely convenient. They offered a choice between a room on the street and a quiet room. The quiet room was very quiet indeed.Nice quality bath supplies, although they didn't always replace stuff when I used it up. Towels definitely fluffy, and I liked the bathrobes they provided. Only weak spots were TV (few channels, not great reception) and the wireless, although free (a must in any reasonable hotel) it is spotty.
I travel often to San Francisco (1-2 times a month) and while recently planning on going with my friends for a vacation I booked at Hotel Abri. Trying to save money, I found a decent deal for a hotel that had good reviews here. While not going into further detail, but noting that I had difficulty in checking-in due to housekeeping being short-staffed, there was much issue.The BIGGEST issue I had here was with getting spider bites from sleeping on the sofa bed. After showing the front desk, and after their inspection came out negative, they moved me rooms, but that was it. I still haven't heard back from a manager and was not offered any sort of compensation.I would suggest not going cheap and staying at the Parc 55 across the street.Dear Luke H.,Thank you for your time and for providing us with the details of your experience while staying with us at Hotel AbRi, I want to let you know that I am aware of the multiple interactions/communications with you regarding your check in, stay and insect bites, I want to assure you again that we have followed up with the staff and pest control teams with the same procedures as we communicated to you at the end of your stay that there was no evidence of pests in the room, after our professional vendor inspected and treated the room, we also provided you with the findings and communication. I want to again formally apologize to you and your guests for the multiple interactions and confusion regarding the check in, as our check in time is 3:00pm, however we always try to accommodate guests requests, and our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests, we were sold out the night before and also on the day of your arrival the requests are challenging to grant as our check out time is 12 noon. Also our apologies for the confusion on your reservation made by the third party which provided you with a One deluxe room with double double beds, not a two bedroom room, as stated, our front desk team did upgrade you to one of our Urban Suites to provide you with more space and a better stay for you and your guests. I am very sorry that even with the steps we took to upgrade your room type we failed to provide you a great stay, as this situation does not reflect our Hotel AbRis core values, style or caring approach, we totally understand your point of view, but we would like to let you know that our teams are diligently working with our third party partners to resolve these type of situations, so it would not affect other guests as it affected you. However this is not an excuse for the actions or scenario you described, during your stay we really tried to provide you with all the upgraded amenities our Urban welcome provides, but as we can see we fail on the communication and we will work on getting better. I can assure you that the sequences of events you have presented are not in any way, our teams guest service standards or company goals. I want you to know our leadership and service team have followed the procedures as we are truly concern and sadden by the details of your experience, and we want to again apologize on this format as we have done for the past days during communications with you. I would like to request from you another opportunity to further discuss and try to turn this situation from a negative experience to a positive, as we value our guests feedback. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800, we are anxious to show you the caring, casual and family atmosphere we promote in our Hotel. Thank you again for your feedback and I look forward to speaking with you. Have a great day!EJ Varela Hotel Manager
A lot of ventilation noise, it's impossible to sleep even the closed window ... In addition, it is necessary to know that it's the second year when we come and when we have the same chamber. It's unacceptable !! Look at the photo :Hello Axetoni11, please accept my sincerest apology if your stay with us was not acceptable. Please know that we appreciate your business and hoped that you booked with us directly so that we can give you a complimentary upgrade to one of our urban suite (based on availability). The front desk staff are also available to help you find a better room (interior/quiet) if the one we gave you was not up to your standard. Again, I apologize and hope that you'll give us another chance in the near future. Thank you for your feedback.
Great little hotel in the center of SF. Very close to stores, public transportation (F line to the Wharf), cable cars. Tiny but nice rooms, friendly staff. Negatives: - outrageous parking price (50/night valet) - no gym (it is really small)
Staff was nice and professional. They held our luggage while my fiance and I explored the city. The lady at the front desk recommended Cafe Mason for breakfast and it was delicious. Room was average. Bed was very comfortable like sleeping on a cloud. Our room was facing the night club so it was noisy making it hard to sleep. Other than that, I would recommend staying here.
The hotel was nice and it was in a great location. Our room experienced a little outside noise due to the restaurant below, but the hotel staff was very apologetic. The train station and trolley is right around the corner. They don't give very good written directions if you want them, they tell you where something is and you just hope you don't forget what they said. Overall, very happy with our stay.Dear Shoney75,Thank you very much for your valuable feedback. I am thrilled that you had an enjoyable stay with us. We are always excited and eager to make recommendations for guests when exploring the city, but I do apologize for the lack of written directions throughout your excursions. I have shared your experience with our staff and we will make sure to be as thorough as possible in the future. We hope to welcome you back to the Hotel Abri when your travels return you to the vibrant city of San Francisco!Yours in hospitality,Rob Brehant, General Manager, on behalf of the entire Abri Team
For what we got it was pretty expensive, although it seems all hotels in the area were pretty expensive. The room was very cramped with very little space besides the bed. The room also smelled weird and the staff were not helpful with respect to that. They gave a welcome bag with a bottle of cheap sangria, a small bag of chips, and some water bottles. The lobby has a couple of computers and some tea/coffee.Location of the hotel is pretty good - right near a big mall, the cable cars, subways/buses, and not too far from various attractions. Nice area to walk around in too.Dear slimmybim,Thank you for your time and honest feedback about your stay with us at Hotel AbRi. I am genuinely sorry to read about your disappointment with our guests rooms, specifically regarding the size, smell, and the welcome amenities provided as it seemed that our accommodations were not comfortable for your needs and no value added was provided to you during your stay also I am truly sadden to hear that our gift bag and selections were not well received, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 60 gift bags per day and we update our amenities every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of your disappointment with the choice of sangria, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience.We are a currently following up with our housekeeping department on the strange smell, so we can ensure this situation will not surface in the near future. While the building structure is a historical building from 1907, and still maintains many of the architecturally historic qualities from the early 20th century including the interior corridors and original room layout, we are very proud of the overall quality, furniture and modern condition of our property. However this is not an excuse to justify your experience during your stay, we tried to provide you with all the amenities our property has to offer, but as we can see we fail on the delivery. I would like the opportunity to further discuss the details and concerns. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800. Thank you again for your time and I look forward to speaking with you. EJ Varela - Hotel Manager
I am regular visitor to SF and this was my first stay in Hotel Abri, I used to stay in the nearby Marriott. Overall, I am highly satisfied with my stay, would recommend it and will certainly come back again. The hotel is very well positioned in the city, close to the large shopping center and quick access to major city landmarks. The rooms are decent size particularly when you consider you are in the downtown core of San Francisco. I had a king size suite, very comfortable, clean, and a well appointed interior. The suite was located internally, away from the busy street which made it very quiet. The hotel staff was very professional, attentive to my requests, and I would like to to thank Christian, Nabih, front desk personnel and everyone else for making my stay at Hotel Abri very enjoyable experience.
Fantastic visit from New Orleans for my wife and I. All staff members were terrific and provided genuine care in each interaction. PP was full of flavor, and lead by a great team. I HIGHLY recommend.
I was so pleased when I saw the location and the facilities, however I never knew whether there was a work out room, or what or where any of the amenities were. The front desk people always seemed like they didn't know whether or not to welcome me. We called the front desk one day because the dvd player wasn't working. They didn't send anyone, so I finally went downstairs after thirty minute's to find someone, and it was the doorman that called the maintenance man for me. He came and helped, but could never fix it, so we thought it was our DVD. We spent the last day of our trip traveling back to where we made the purchase, only to find that it was the hotel's dvd player. So we wasted the entire last day of our trip. So I would say that the service was really lacking, but I loved the building and location and price.
Excellent hotel near Union Square. Easy access to other city attractions.Very easy to get almost anywhere in San Francisco from this location. Accommodations are affordable and very comfortable. Highly recommended!
Stayed for a long weekend. This place is great. It is steps from the cable car turn around, great shopping, and excellent restaurants!! We had a little suite with a separate sitting room and a pull out couch. We faced inside and it was quiet!! Hotel staff was all so nice and always asking if you needed anything. Quick with extra towels, etc. can't say enough to about this location!!! Full size shampoo/conditioner/shower gel in shower. Great restaurant attached to the hotel. We also revived a little bag upon Checkin with two bottle of voss water, some snacks and a bottle of wine. Everything we needed to get settled! Valet was available for 60 a day (comparable to others in the area) we parked the car and used public transportation the entire weekend. I would have no problems recommended! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!
Loud street noise wasn't quite drowned out by the droning AC unit. Good thing I sleep like the dead or I would have been dead tired. Maid service was excellent staff very friendly and helpful. Convenient location.
Good price and location, noisy for those who look for calm nights, room was too small even for me alone ...but overall I like the place..wifi connection for free which is good, you are right by union square and all shops... you can reach by public transport - no need for taxi
What a great stay!!!! This hotel is extremely well located, near Union Square, Bart, Bus stops and major shopping areas. Room was very clean and with a modern decoration. Bathroom very spacious At our arrival, we were upgraded because it was our anniversary and there was even a bottle of wine compliments of the hotel waiting in our room. But service was SUPERB!!!. Front desk staff was more than Helpfull, specially ELLE, she was great, even helped us to get last minute tickets to see Placido Domingo at the Opera. Complimentary coffe at the room and the one offered at the lobby very good! This was my third visit to San Francisco this year, and this hotel was by far the most enjoyable. Now I found our Boutique hotel in SF, definitively coming back again.!!!!
From the moment I arrived, I received superior customer service from the person who opened the door to the hotel to the front desk staff and that never changed. I requested a quiet room, so they put me in one that faced a brick wall to another building, but this was far superior to not being able to sleep due to street noise as other reviewers mentioned. The room was nice, clean and quaint. Comfy bed. Free WiFi, which worked well. Free coffee tea. The location was perfect for my needs - I was on business attending a conference two blocks down (Moscone Center area). And, there were some great restaurants nearby too. I'd definitely stay again!
Our family of 4 stayed for two nights after Xmas. Pros: good room size, convenient location (close to cable car terminal muni), reasonable price. Cons: street noise (garbage trucks were heard for a long time during the night), upstair noise (footsteps, probably due to the age of the building), and not so warm front desk.
You just walk out and experience San Fransisco. Loved the hospitality of the staff.Especially the younger guy (sorry, forgot your name). Very interested in his guests and tries to transpose in situations. If you read this, hope you still love the love the house and techno music :)
Excellent location very close to all public transportation with cable car just around the corner, shopping mall just a few minutes walk away and all sorts of restaurants in walking distances from the hotel. Very nice and helpful staff.Hello Gunnaro862, thank you for giving us a 5 star rating. We are happy to know that we met your needs and expectations. Come visit us again in the near future. Stay vibrant!
The staff alone was cool and accomodating enough to make me want to stay there every time I return. The location was very central to lots of great shopping and restaurants. The room was clean and comfortable. No complaints!
I love this hotel and its location. Our room which I requested to be located away from the street was honored with no problems. Jonathan who checked us in was wonderful! In learning we were return visitors and celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary, he graciously upgraded us to a larger room. The room was comfy, cozy and the bed was sooo comfortable, Slept like a baby. EVERY ONE of the hotel staff displayed wonderful hospitality to us during our 4 day stay. My only wish, is a shower with more pressure.You could not ask for a better location or a great staff and rooms. We will be back!!!
From the moment we were greeted by the doorman and the staff at check-in, everyone went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. They provided parking options (60 for on-site valet), presented us with a welcome bag full of treats. They were even able to accommodate an early check-in. The location is fabulous. We chose Hotel Abri because it was over 100 less than a place across the street. I couldn't have been more pleased. I would definitely stay here again.Greetings letsgo168, thank you for the positive feedback. We are happy to know that we met your expectations. Come and see us again soon!
Hotel Abri is a clean, cute, boutique hotel with a great location. I've stayed at over 5+ hotels in the area and this had by far the best staff. They were friendly, attentive, and very helpful when I had questions. Unlike some of the larger hotels in SF, this one makes you feel at home and cared for. In terms of the most impressive of the staff, Kelly Nguyen stuck out and really went above and beyond. Thank you.
Convenient location to race finish line. Conveient to major shopping district, trolly station and walking distance to fun sites to see. Rooms were on the small side but to be expected with a historic building. Very nicely renovated. Beds were comfortable and room was quiet had no trouble relaxing and sleeping.Hello carolynt258,I'm glad you found our hotel to be relaxing and convenient! I hope you did well with the marathon as well. Hopefully we see you again next time whether it be another marathon or just visiting us for pleasure!Stay Vibrant!Chris de Jesus
Abri is a very nice and modern hotel in an old building in the Heart of San Francisco. It is very tastefully decorated, clean and fresh. Interior rooms are quiet and will allow you a great nites sleep. Real HD TV, not just a big screen with SD TV. You wont be disappointed.
Good location, very small, clean room in a no frills hotel. I booked a queen but they put us in a double. Lots of street noise as it's only a 4 story hotel. Worse 3 mights of sleep we have had in sometime. id you can see past a downtown, non-resort hotel charging a resort fee, then go ahead and book. Me, I can't so will avoid. My 125 turned into 158( plus usual taxes.) Just tell me upfront
This is a great place to stay in SF downtown - close to everything, very nice hotel, helpful personnel. The room is a bit small but very modern, bathroom is really nice. Overall - great stay and value for money!
It is a real city hotel. Small but neat room. No view. No refill coffee but when you ask you will get it.Breakfast you pick up and its in a little bag and not very special. But the location is perfect! When you come by car you better park a few blocks away, not such a fine neighborhood but half the price.
Just stayed at Hotel Abri this past week end. The staff was amazing. Very friendly, attentive and shows an interest in your whereabouts. We had an Oasis Suite, and pull out queen size bed was comfortable. Bathroom is pretty good size with 2 separate sinks. Location is superb! Walk to China town, North Beach and so close to Bart. My only complaint thus the reason for Very good vs. excellent is the noise level. The suites face the street, and with construction in the area which starts up at 7:00AM, it was LOUD. Construction will go on for a while since they are building a bart station. There is a bar close by and the shouting/talking at night can be deafening. Ask for an inside room to avoid this disturbance. If you must have a suite, then bring ear plugs. Will return for sure!
We stayed 4 nights. There were three of us so the third person had a sofa bed in the lounge area. The good things were the location, free wifi and the staff seemed nice. We asked for a quiet room when we booked and so glad we did. It meant no view but we slept well. It is a bit dated and there was a very odd smell to the room. Only one lift in use throughout our stay. Overall it did the job with no frills. Next time I think I'll go for something newer or with character. The lobby area seemed new and really smart, it didn't match the rooms. Hello bn1,Thank you for taking the time to share your stay experiences with us. Tailoring to our guest is our specialty and each review helps us reach a better customer service level. I am glad to hear our front desk staff were friendly upon your arrival and you found our prime location convenient. Our building has been a hotel since 1908 holding it's authentic charm while being constantly renovated to fit San Francisco style and taste. We hope you return so we can wow you with our new updates and customer service. Happy Holidays,Dan NovellyFront Office Manger
I stayed there last week and it's a nice little hotel. Location is close to Market St, cable car, buses, and plethora of bars and restaurants. My room is like a city apartment and felt very homey as opposed to a hotel. So, that was nice. The staff is very friendly and helpful. One of the staffs, Taylor, gave great recommendations to Thai and other restaurants in the area. Thanks, Taylor!! I will definitely stay at Hotel Abri again.
Abri Hotel is a very good option for staying at San Francisco. Its very well located and staff is really friendly and helfpul. The only thing you need to know is that you are going to pay a lot of city taxes.
Very nice boutique hotel in a great location. Rooms facing the courtyard were quiet. Friendly staff and clean rooms. Would definitely recommend. Reasonable price for San Francisco too. Short walk from Union square Hello TF44,I'd like to thank you for leaving a review of your stay at Hotel AbRi. I'm glad you enjoyed your interaction with our staff and that the room was to your liking. We hope to see you again the next time you visit our wonderful city.Thank you once again!Chris de Jesus
Used hotel tonight, got in late, was greeted by Kevin who helped me plan a run route. Got to the room it was clean, great bed. Location is prime close to market street. Nice gem, excellent service. Will definitely stay here again.
Suite was small. It was on the highest floor. The roof top must have faulty drainage. When it rained heavily, water drops beat on the case housing the air conditioner as if someone was beating a drum.
We have stayed at this hotel for three straight years. We in this case includes myself, my wife, and our 8 kids. The kids have ranged in ages from 1 year old up to 17 years old (depending on the stay) and we have loved it every time.We have stayed in a suite each year and at least one (sometimes two) other rooms. The suite with the adjoining room is great for our needs.The location is perfect. Right near the Bart, right in Union Square. Need a quick bite to eat for a picky kid Subway is next door. Want a quick ice cream for a kid (or adult) quickly Cold Stone right next door, as well. And of course you are within about a 3 minute walk of 100 other restaurants of 35 different types.Why do we keep coming back to the same hotel with all the other choices SERVICE! This place just gets it. They put an emphasis on service that is difficult to find. There may be hotels with more room or for better prices. But knowing that we will be treated exceptionally well and knowing the staff will help us out with any questions or needs is worth the extra few dollars. My only complaint is that the suite has bathroom doors of frosted glass so you can see the silhouette of the person standing in the bathroom or getting out of the shower. Not perfect for a family, and also the door is sliding, no locks. Made more for a couple than a family, so communication is important to avoid any issues. Still, more than worth the minor inconvenience with all this hotel offers.Hello Mark B,Thank you for taking the time to share your holiday experience with us. It is ALWAYS a pleasure to have you and your family celebrate the holidays with our family here at AbRi. I am happy to hear you enjoyed the delicious spots next door to us and all our nearby shopping areas. Thank you kindly for your detailed feedback as every review helps us on our stride for perfection.As we say here at Hotel AbRi, stay vibrant!Warmest Regards,Daniel Novelly Front Office Manager
This is a very clean and friendly place to stay. It is a couple of blocks from BART (easy to and from SFO) and one block from the Cable Cars. The area is great for shopping and has easy access to all parts of town.
Recently booked the Hotel for a trip to San Francisco through Hotels.com and confirmation offered free cancellation but in reading fine print. The policy was backdated to a month before I booked the room. They don't even give you the opportunity to cancel less than 30 minutes after booking...beware!Hello Greg R, I'm sorry to hear that you had an issue with cancelling your reservation through hotels.com. Unfortunately, our hands are tied when it comes to non-refundable booking. Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I will share this with our reservations department so that future guests will not have the same experience.
We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Abri. From the moment we arrived, staff were warm, welcoming, professional, and helpful. The hotel is older but the rooms are updated and renovated. The hotel has great incentive programs (Green for Green). We had a few special requests that were easily accommodated. Great value, great location, great staff!! High recommend.Greetings hayjhamilton, thank you for giving us a 5 star rating. We are happy to know that your stay with us was a 5 star experience. please come and see us again in the near future. Stay vibrant!
Very positive experience. Super convenient location. Clean and quiet room with plenty of space. Hotel staff very helpful. We got some great tips for eating and sightseeing from Louie, the very friendly concierge. Would definitely stay there again.Hello kenandemilie, thank you for giving us a 5 star rating. We are pleased to know that your stay with us was comfortable and convenient. Please come and see us again on your next visit to San Francisco. Stay vibrant!
Thank you for making my trip to San Francisco for a conference enjoyable. The room was so quiet. It was smaller than most hotel rooms I have stayed in but that made it more cozy. I was able to open the window for air. Everything was clean. The hotel staff were always pleasant and greeted me whenever our paths crossed. Thanks for the gifts just because I did not require maid service.
We thought the hotel was very clean, and modern. Ideal position for sight seeing. Very helpful front desk. Great restaurant next door. Great happy hour. Would definitely go there again. Easy to get on public transport, trams, buses etc. Great restaurants at Fishermans Wharf. Must go to Alcatraz, very interesting.
We chose Hotel Abri from among many choices in the neighborhood and price range mainly because of the interesting look of the decor in the photos. Glad we did! The staff were all extremely nice, and the room was quite comfortable. This was only an overnight trip, but we look forward to coming back and spending more nights here.
My sweety and I had visited San Francisco for an overnight trip and decided since I found a shockingly great price for this hotel and knew the neighbourhood, I figured this had to be good.. Understatement! The Hotel Abri was a stellar hotel staff is always glad to see you, hotel is kept in immaculate condition, bed was worthy of taking home if it were possible, and L'Occitane toiletries were teh OMGz.. Ginormous flat-screen TV also came with a connection for your laptop so you can use it as a monitor, clock radio also had an iPod dock attached. The only negative out of the entire stay (which the Abri can't really help) was facing another hotel I've visited previously which had a new club open up. And when you have late night clubs in a big city, you also get an occasional drunk being asked to leave said club for acting royally ASBO. Other than that, I'd recommend the Abri if you're looking to splurge a bit for a hotel not far from Powell Market, a major transit hub and terminus for the Cable Cars just a couple blocks away..
I was little worried about Hotel Abri at first. Its prices were much less than surrounding hotels which made me skeptical. However, immediately upon arrival, it was obvious that the hotel was just fine. The gift bag at check-in was a nice touch (especially the full-size bottle of whine). I had read the reviews and read about the gift bag, but I just assumed it included it one of those little whine bottles and a few other things. The room was small, but not any smaller than I would have expected for what was most likely an old apartment building turned hotel room. And definitely no smaller than 90 of the apartments you'd see in Manhattan. Despite the size of the room, it was well-appointed and had a decent size bathroom and shower. The rooms had window AC/heat units, but they were thermostatically controlled, which was nice (instead of just being a thru-wall unit with a speed knob. The morning breakfast bag left a lot to be desired (as compared to a standard continental breakfast), but it was better than nothing. They also give you coupons to the restaurant that connects to the lobby. We didn't get the chance to eat there, but it looked nice. Anyhow, there wasn't anything overwhelmingly fantastic about the hotel, not was there really anything bad. It was a nice launching bad for our activities for a long weekend. We walked to ATT Park for the Giants game (not far), and the cable car stop was only a few blocks away (as well as all of the shopping). Likewise, Enterprise retail car was just one block away (this came in handy because we rented a car to drive to Sonoma). All in all, a good experience, decent hotel, helpful and kind staff we would stay here again Fo Sho!Hello Matt B, thank you for your feedback. We are pleased to know that your overall experience at the Hotel Abri was good and that you will come and visit us again. Stay vibrant!
Okay experience but disappointed that I had a room next to constant construction. Also disappointed in the fact that I thought I was getting l'occitane products as well. Room was good and bed was comfortable. Hi laurenbX4703AO,I apologize that construction outside is constant during your stay. I suggest one of our interior rooms the next time you stay with us to accommodate a much more quieter stay. We hope that you give us another opportunity in the future!Stay Vibrant!Chris de Jesus
I stayed here recently for a conference. It is centrally located, short walk to Moscone (which is undergoing reconstruction), and very comfortable. I was greeted with a gift bag (usually this is only for weddings) that contained a small bottle of wine, 2 bottles of water, and snacks, which I appreciated. They also provided a 10 credit for the restaurant. The room was small, but there was room for my suitcase, I could hang my clothes in the closet, I could work at the desk, everything was clean, and the room was quiet. What else do you want when staying downtown in San Francisco
This was our first stay in the Hotel Abri and we were impressed with the hotel and the staff. We had a Queen size Junior Suite for less than the price of a tiny room in one of the other more well-known hotels. Location is great - 1 block from Powell Street cable car and 2 blocks from Union Square.
Hotel Abri is a wonderfully located hotel near Union Square and all the amenities you'll need in San Francisco. The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean, the amenities are good and the price is competitive. Recommended.Hello torontonian360, Thank you for the kind words. I thank you for taking the time to leave us a great review of our hotel. We look forward to be able to assist you again in the future! Stay Vibrant! Chris de Jesus
Enjoyed staying here. The staff was great (very attentive helpful) the rooms were clean. The rooms were small though. I enjoyed eating at the on-site restaurant. The food bar services were great!
I stayed here for a few days in a double bed room.Pros:- room clean- mattress and pillows very comfortable- free wi-fi - location very good: downtown, 3 minutes from the cable car terminus on Powell Street- staff friendly and professional.Cons:- given the location, it's a bit noisy at night. Well, downtown San Francisco is a bit noisy, so I guess you'll have the same issues in any hotel there- one of the two elevators was broken, so there was only one, slow elevator serving the whole hotel. You could wait 10 minutes before getting it, so more than once I decided to take the stairs. However, this should be a temporary issue, since I saw they were working on it- the wi-fi was nearly useless--not only communicating via Skipe was impossibile (which might be understandable, given the bandwidth frequired), but also surfing the Web was a hard thing to do at times. This is really an issue they should solve, since it can be done easily and quickly- they don't serve breakfast. There's a restaurant (Puccini Pinetti) which is accessible straight from the hotel, however it opens at 11am, so you can only get a brunch. Anyway, no big issue: there is plenty of places around there where you can have breakfast.Price: I found a discount, so I think the price was fair, otherwise I would say it's a bit costy.
Central to everything. Rooms are a bit on the small side, but they have all you need. We stayed three nights. Its a nice, comfortable and clean hotel. Shopping is very close by and its about a 10 minute ride to Fishermans Wharf and the other touristy stuff.
Good to stay confortable. The location is the best. Rooms are small than expectation but its not the worst.all are staffs very kindly and helpful.wifi is available and there are nothing the problems during stayed.Hi sjung721731,I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us at Hotel AbRi. The history of our building combined with new world technologies along with a great staff makes Hotel AbRi a pleasant place to stay. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to provide you the service we are known for.Stay Vibrant!Chris de Jesus
Hotel Abri has a good friendly team of front desk staff and a simply trendy lobby that gave me a good impression to start. The room is small and only minimally functional for a group of four (I should've checked the footage before I booked a double room for four). We had a street-facing room so it was really really noisy at night given the frequent ambulance, passengers and especially the construction noise that went beyond midnight (I didn't know that construction was allowed after 11pm in SF). Service and notes in the room were a bit confusing and inconsistent. There was no introduction pamphlets describing services of the hotel, no sign in the room stating that the water bottles weren't free. Out of my four night stays, one night I did not have enough towels, one with water not replenished, and another without any coffee/tea replenished in the room. Other minor inconvenience include not having hand soap provided, and the hotel does not have shoe horns to lend out. At the end I would still give this hotel a positive vote given their friendly front desk service and convenience of location.
I and my wife stayed in the Hotel Abri 2 nights, the room was not huge but very clean decor 4 star hotel. The staff was very helpful and the location fantastic Hotel in downtown San Francisco. Next year we plan to go back to San Francisco and Abri will be our Hotel.
Had a suite, which was roomy and well-equipped. Location was fantastic. Staff were helpful. Street noise was the only concern but turning on the fans in the AC units drowned it out. There was no hotel bar or restaurant but there are many nearby.
This was my first stay at this hotel and with the Larkspur brand of hotels. I have been to San Fran a countless number of times and have always stayed in Union Square at other hotels (Hotel Nikko, Kimpton, etc). I must say that this hotel was very nice. It wasnt a large hotel (4 floors) but it was perfect and allowed for a better guest experience in my opinion. The rooms were nicely appointed and extremely clean, very modern. They are on the tight side but that is normal for SF, so no big deal. The staff at this hotel were probably some of the best I have encountered in a while. They were genuinely nice and allowed us to check in 4 hrs early. They were also quick to ask us if we needed help finding restaurants etc. Location is great, 1 block from the BART station, great if you are arriving from SFO, or OAK. Cable car is also right down the street. Area was safe at all hours of the day, except for occasional panhandler but that is normal in every big city.Suggestions for guests would be to ask for an interior courtyard room as the exterior rooms face a nightclub and it can be noisy. If not ear plugs are readily available at the front desk.Overall this hotel is tops and I would stay here again if I am back in the city.
We arrived to check-in at 4pm. The person at the counter did not acknowledge us for 20 minutes while she casually talked to the customer in front. Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.Ms. Sara Z , Let me start this response by apologizing to both of you in regards to the overall experience you had at our hotel, as we can see we failed to meet your basic guest needs. Our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests on Friday Saturday, we failed to provide you with personalized service and attention during your arrival and throughout. We are happy to hear that the upgraded accommodations to our Urban suite was up to your standards. Also regarding the gift bag and wine, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 30 gift bags per day and we have not had this situation happened before, we update our wines every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of the wine during your visit, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience. I am sorry we missed you during your checkout, as our Manager on Duty was available and expecting you. We hope that you would provide us the opportunity to further discuss the details of your stay you can contact me directly at 415.392.8800. We look forward to your response. Thank you again for your time and honest feedback. Have a great weekend!EJ Varela Hotel Manager
We were charged for the first night of stay even though we were not in SF yet due to a sudden death in the family. In addition, the room we were given the next day was one of the smallest I've ever had, even though we had requested ahead of time to an upgrade. Told we didn't get the upgrade because we weren't there to check in. Throughout our four-night stay, one elevator was out of service and the other was very slow. We resorted to using the stairs to our third floor room. At checkout, we waited almost 15 minutes for an elevator because our luggage was too heavy to carry down the stairs. HOWEVER, for our final three nights we were upgraded to an Oasis Suite for no additional charge (beyond the night we were charged and didn't use). Very quiet, spacious room facing courtyard. Location is great for all SF tourist activities and shopping. Ate one night in the Italian restaurant. It was decent and the service was good. If check-in and the first night had been better, I'd give it a 5, but the poor first impression dropped the overall score. Hope both elevators are now functioning!
My husband, 4 year old, and I stayed at the Hotel Abri from Oct 11-14, 2012. The staff at this hotel were beyond 5 star with their service. They were helpful, honest, and really went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. My daughter was taken with Tyler at the front, in particular! Aside from the service, the boutique hotel was fine. We had an urban suite, which had ample room. The two window units kept the place cool, and the curtains kept out enough light. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint, was that the bathroom door was a sliding door, did not lock, and was frosted glass. If you have kids, you know that sometimes your only solitude can come from the few moments you get in the bathroom. My daughter had a grand time putting her face up to the glass and letting us know she was well aware we were in there, and I am thankful she never realized she could actually open the door. My husband would probably say that he didn't care for the fact that sometimes during the day you could smell Subway from downstairs in our room (on the 2nd floor), but we weren't in there much, and it was minor. The hotel was very convenient to the cable car that took you to the Wharf, as well as the BART and other public transport. There was AMPLE shopping in the area too. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, mainly to people traveling without small kids. LOL
the hotel has a cool vibe, there is no where to eat breakfast in the hotel so that's an issue, I had a problem with the reservation and was not accommodated on my request so that's impacted my experience after the fact. San Francisco has a huge homeless problem and unfortunately that impacts the surrounding area, I was disturbed by the number of homeless people sleeping on the street in front of the hotel so consider that before booking
Stayed here during a conference being held at the mega hotel Hilton up the block from Abri. Glad I chose the Abri, medium sized, clean hotel in a Union Square central location. My room was small but perfectly formed and the walk-in shower was powerful. My room had a strange smell to it during my stay which meant I had to have the window open most of the time for fresh air. Ask for an inner room to avoid noise from the busy street outside.I visited SF about 5 years ago so was shocked at the amount of homeless people everywhere this time round. Every street corner was filled with people begging so be prepared to have your dollar bills ready. Breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was good. Great shopping near by. Enjoy!
We stayed 2 nights and could not have been more happy with the hotel. The hotel is situated in a great position close to all the major stores and good restaurants. The staff at the front desk went out of their way to assist us. Would highly recommend a stay.
Great location hip and trendy interior nicely appointed rooms. FREE internet access in your room! Really appreciate the fact that they recognize those serving in our military with special deals! We requested a room away from the elevators and stairs and our request was met 100!
The location of the hotel is excellent, right by Union Square and Westfield Shopping centre on Market street. The staff are excellent and have great attention to detail. Rooms are great and given its location are very quiet, perfect for a good nights sleep. Only one minor niggle which is that the showers are really not very powerful at all.
Happy to be in SF for the first time in this Hotel. Our room was well furnished and we took a mini-suite for our 3 family member. We would definitely come back here the next time. Our slight disappointement was related to the ameties: difficult to find some coffee during the day.
What a great hotel. We arrived early after about 22 hours travel and they had a room ready for us straight away along with a lovely welcome pack. Location in fabulous and staff are really helpful. Their 10 daily restaurant voucher and Green for Green initiative for skipping housekeeping are excellent. A lovely plac3 to stay.
The hotelt is close to the main places: cable car, subway, shops: you can go by walk everywhere. The personnel is nice and friendly, the room is clean, comfortable and nice.If you have some problem to sleep, you have only to ask to have a room not in the front of the street because during the weekend there is a local where the people go to dance we were so tired that we didn't have any problem about it.
In a city not known for sumptuous hotels, the St Regis is the local maximum. We stayed in a large, well-appointed suite with a nice view. We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg, as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street, while not of the same caliber, has infinitely better views. So, ask for floors 14-20. Below that, it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now, for the good stuff: Nice pool area, very good spa treatments, and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic, with SF Moma half a block away, and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall, a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel, but definitely the best in San Francisco.
When travelling for business, the thing you care most about is getting some sleep, being able to effectively work and having a functional room that takes all the friction and noise out of your day. The St Regis delivered in spades. Nothing too much trouble for the staff and excellent service on every interaction. Dear Meek4,Thank you for taking the time to share a review on your recent visit to The St. Regis San Francisco. We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel for future visits and will share your kind mentions with our team. Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager
We had a long layover in San Francisco and chose to stay in Union Square. The St Regis met our needs in terms of a comfortable place to stay, from which to explore some of the touristy areas of SF. However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out. Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags. We don't generally enjoy the butler concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18. There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back. Food was extremely pricey. The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults. We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver something for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment. It is definitely geared toward the business traveler.Dear Globaltattler,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your most recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We apologize that you experienced increased traffic over the Pride weekend, and that our Butler service did not meet your expectations. Here at the St. Regis San Francisco we truly strive to surprise and delight all of our guests, and we are always grateful for any feedback that will allow us to do that better.Please do reach out to me personally should your travels bring you back to San Francisco.Warm Regards,Andre BroseHotel Manager
Got a nice room (1715) on 17th floor, but woke up three times at night because somebody must have run the tap or had a shower. When having a shower in the beautful seperate shower cabin, twice I adjusted the water temperature, stood under the shower for a minute or so when the water got really scorchingly hot and I had to move away from it, turn down the temperature, almost turning the water off, wait a minute for it to cool down, then feel it got really cold. Back to the original setting and eventually enjoy the shower.Sorry guys, at 490 a night that's not okay. Noise plus burning yourself is not acceptable.One more thing I hate: Monday night 7.30, I want to go jogging and ask for steam room/sauna after jog. Answer: it's part of our Spa and admission is 20 for hotel guests - and it closes at 8pm on a Monday. Come on, guys, that's not okay for a 5 Star hotel. Not only having to pay - but closung at 8 doesn't work for business people!
Of the ten or so hotels I've stayed in in San Fran, the St. Regis is my favorite. Great location, lovely lobby and bar, and sleek modern rooms. Restaurants always left something to be desired, but looks as though a new one just opened. The service is top notch and the concierge is stellar. Sadly, like everything else in SF, the rates have gone up significantly so I don't get to stay there as often.Dear sncwalsh,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am pleased to hear that we continue to be your favorite hotel in San Francisco, and sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our staff and service. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit, as we hope to welcome you back to the Best Address soon.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com
The St. Regis is located pretty conveniently if you have business in downtown SF. The rooms are very new and well appointed. Staff is generally helpful, but service could be better. For example, when I called the front desk to ask about internet access, they informed me it would be extra, even though I could have sworn it was included in my rate (it was). A key issue is there is absolutely zero cellular reception if you're on ATT. The hotel acknowledges this (obviously not their fault), so if you need blackberry access, forget about it.
St. Regis are consistently luxurious and expensive. This one is no exception. Small lobby, but great service, beautiful rooms, great workout facility. It is a location that's not overly ideal for the touristy options (Wharf, bridge, china town), but if you want class and can afford it, this is the place.Dear JoesueFree ,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

My husband and I stayed at the St. Regis for six nights while visiting San Francisco. I spent a great deal of time selecting the hotel for this trip. After researching and considering many hotels, I chose the St. Regis. I was very happy with my choice. The location was great - it was close enough to every place we wanted to visit, without being in the middle of too much of the touristy crowd. Although our room didn't have the floor to ceiling windows I was expecting, it was nicely equipped and well maintained. I can overlook my disappointment over the absence of a panoramic view because of the amazing service. From the time we made our reservations to the time we left the hotel, the service was attentive and thoughtful, without being obtrusive. The concierge and guest relations people helped us with our wine tour, ferry and restaurant plans. The people at the front desk and in the lobby greeted us by name. Those at the restaurant, the Vitrine, were particularly kind and thoughtful. Kane was our server on most mornings. When he found out it was my birthday, he brought me a special breakfast dessert. To celebrate our anniversary, he brought us champagne and chocolate. The service made it truly a memorable stay. I'm sure that the service at the St. Regis will become the standard by which we will measure other hotels.Dear Kingtrips,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

Well ion advance of our trip out west Mariah at the concierge desk set us up for the best trip possible. She'd helped us some years ago and when I emailed I wasn't sure she'd still be there. Not only did she respond but she also remembered us and was more than helpful and available both in advance of the trip and during. Also Selena and Alexandre (who remembered us from his time at the St Regis NY) were of great help!Also Tatianna and Abhishek with the butler department, Eric at the bar, Irma a the front desk, Freddo at the front door and Linh at the Spa. You will love the place and love the people.
First let me start by saying that this is not a cheap hotel, however the same can be said for the majority of downtown San Francisco Hotels. My room was very comfortable and sported an IPad type control screen that enabled me to adjust all the settings in the room such as lights and curtains ect. Service was outstanding and so overall a great experience.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

5 years ago it was a much better option ,they still charge high prices and have not nvested much .Definetely need refurbishment and / or they should be charging much lower .Attitude of reception is unacceptable , some of the consierge is OK , other services ( vale - breakfast... ) is not in accordence with 5 star hotel !!!Dear Vedat A,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

Just complete a stay at St. Regis for our anniversary. Reached out to the hotel in advance and they took great care of us. Had a room on the 16th floor with spectacular city views. Check in was efficient and friendly. Room was large and well appointed - very luxurious. My wife enjoyed the soaker tub. Hotel provided a special amenity in celebration of our anniversary - we very much appreciated the special attention. Used the pool area which had lots of sun and city views. St. Regis beats Ritz and Four Seasons hands down in SF. Thanks for a great stay.

The St. Regis San Fran is outstanding! Location is perfect, just South of Market, right next to the Museum of Modern Art, across the street from Yerba Buena, Metreon, and a short walk to all of the Union Square and Market Street shopping. The hotel is modern and sophisticated, but also really comfortable and welcoming. We loved the fireplace that greets you on the other side of the front door, and the lobby bar is super chic with a lively scene. We loved the indoor pool! This is a great amenity for a city hotel, especially when traveling with a family. The pool is warm and there are tons of windows and natural light. There's a poolside menu for food and beverages. Grill is the contemporary restaurant that serves seasonal dishes with locally sourced ingredients. We are gluten free and they do a fantastic job with this - lots of gluten free menu options and the gluten free bread was delicious. We saw the beautiful house car (a Bentley), but our timing was off with it pulling away each time we were hoping to catch a ride (next time!). We were in a Grand Deluxe Guest room on the 20th floor, and it was amazing. Beautifully finished with high ceilings, big windows allowing for lots of natural light, plenty of space, huge shower, soaking tub, and amazing views over Yerba Buena. My son said the roll away was one of the best he has ever slept in. Can't wait to return to this hotel.
A great place to stay in downtown San Francisco. Across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens and walking distance to Union Square and lots of shopping.The rooms are spacious and luxurious, as you would expect. Service is friendly. The hotel restaurant, Vittrine, is also excellent.Enjoyed the free wi-fi too, which other travelers commented on being charged for... so perhaps this has improved/changed.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our service, hotel dcor, and location and am pleased that you enjoyed your meals in Vitrine. As of February 2015, we do offer complimentary high speed internet access to all of our guests, so we are delighted to hear your comments. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next stay, as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057Anthony.dugganstregis.com
The platinum spg member upgraded room was nice. They have very good service and the employees did a great job. The hotel is in a nice location for a convention. The room was loud with street noise, guess just part of the deal in San Francisco.
This review is long overdue.This hotel hasn't let me down, (resort I should say)I'm a picky guy when I spend 400+ a night on a room. I want to be treated well, I want staff to acknowledge my presence, and I want them to be courteous and kind and helpful and most importantly quick.In a consumers' world, we have to pay attention to detail. Otherwise the providers will become lazy..At the St. Regis, attention to detail is not a problem. To say the least, they go overboard.All the rooms are cleaned to perfection before arrival, I've stayed here a total of 6 times and have never found something from the room beforeRoom service is of 4-5 Star quality food, hot and ready and fresh.Do not tip the room service, the gratuity is already factored in. Unless you feel like splurging.Amazingly well done eentree choices ordered directly to your room..The reason I go to hotels, is to escape life, go to the spa, sit in my room, watch movies, and be waited on.This hotel does it all.For a Price.a 3 day ultimate vacation as I like to call it, room service once a day, and the spa once a day,Can easily run you over 2000-3000 Dollars here.If you want to just enjoy the room and resort, you can get away with spending 900-1200 on a room for 3 nights and just enjoying yourself.My first stay here was with a Mercedes Benz Voucher way back in the day.Thanks Mercedes Benz, you introduced me to a fantastic resort!Dear Patrick B,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of The St. Regis San Francisco. We sincerely appreciate your loyalty to our hotel and your kind words regarding our staff and service. I am pleased that we have been have to provide you with a five star experience, and look forward to welcoming you to back to Best Address soon.Sincerely,Charles WilliamsDirector of Front Office415-284-4031Charles.williamsstregis.com
Stayed in January for 5 nights. Close enough to the Moscone center (5 minute walk) Staff were very nice and remembered our names, (somewhat) Very nice rooms and comfortable beds. They would clean your room after you left and turn down the beds right before you got back. Unfortunately sometimes the timing was a little off and they walked in while I was changing once and came in while we were there a few other times. It didnt bother me a whole lot but just be aware that if you don't want them to come in then put out the 'do not disturb' sign. Mandatory valet parking and sometimes we were waiting for that service. overpriced hotel bar, you might almost laugh at the prices unless you are made of money (I am not) but then again with how much it costs to stay there a night you probably wouldn't even wink. my view was of a construction sight but I wasn't in the room much so no matter. Never went to the restaurant. there is a pool on the 5th or something like that floor but we didn't swim. Would definitely reccomend if you are rich. If you aren't then dont go broke for the amazing service they offer.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of The St. Regis San Francisco. I ma delighted to hear that you had a pleasant stay and appreciate your kind words about our staff and service. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057Anthony.dugganstregis.com
The location is convenient, just a few minutes walk South of Market Union Sq.The facilities rooms are very nice.The staff are excellent, as is the service.The barmen drinks are also very good.The only reason I didn't award Excellent is that the food in the restaurant at breakfast lunch was average.Also beware that certain rooms are subject to a lot of street noise.Dear Razzi-B,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. Im pleased that you enjoyed our location, guestrooms, and service and apologize for your experience at breakfast and lunch. I encourage you to contact me directly to further discuss your stay as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager415-284-4057Andre.Brosestregis.com
Checking in on New Year's Eve and there was an abundance of staff and champagne cocktails to speed our check in and get our celebration started right away. We had a wonderful room with a private butler and an amazing view of the fireworks over the San Francisco skyline.Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am delighted to hear that you had an exceptional stay over the holiday and that you particularly enjoyed the celebratory cocktails upon arrival. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit to the hotel. Happy New Year!Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057William.fongstregis.com
Stayed at the St. Regis while on business. The rooms were huge! Room had a spacious shower as well as a bath. Wish I had more time to spend in the hotel proper and take advantage of all the amenities. Free shoe shine ... a plus.Highlight: I needed to rent a car, and the hotel's concierge took care of me in 10 minutes ... awesome!
We stopped in for breakfast before our cruise.Very nice hotel and restaurant, great service, food was great!The reason for four stars... My cream pitcher had mold in it.They replaced it and apologized and also removed the charge from our bill. I was not too concerned as mold is not life threatening lol.Dear Lionel P,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent visit to The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize for your experience at breakfast, and appreciate your understanding. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next stay in San Francisco, as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager415-284-4057Andre.Brosestregis.com
The St. Regis never disappoints, we stayed in a lovely room with a view of the new Salesforce tower. The light and bright room was welcoming and well appointed as expected. All of the staff we interacted with were friendly and focused on serving our needs with a smile. The St. Regis beds are amazing, I am shopping their site to buy a St. Regis mattress for our home so I can sleep this well at home soon. This is a delightful place to stay in the San Fran.
My wife and I took a long weekend trip to San Francisco to celebrate our 10th anniversary. By random chance it was Fleet Week so everything was full and busy. Even with the crowds and a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in the building, the staff made us feel welcome and special. The breakfast at the restaurant on the 4th() floor was impeccable as well.Dear Scott M,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. We are honored that you chose our hotel to celebrate your anniversary, and pleased to hear that you had an exceptional experience. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit to San Francisco as we hope to welcome you and your wife back soon.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com
We had our second stay at the St Regis San Francisco for our annual December SF dining weekend--our first was in 2014, though I've had a few business stays in the meantime. Overall, we still love this hotel--but we did experience a few hiccups with service that gave us pause. The hotel has already provided us with a complimentary stay for 2016 to make up for the problems this year, so we feel the hotel got the message and definitely has taken steps to make it up to us.We were informed of our upgrade from the Astor to Metropolitan Suite in an email from my Ambassador the night before arrival. Yet on arrival, they didn't have us in the Metropolitan Suite. After 25 min and showing the email confirmation, we finally were given the keys to the correct suite. This was a big hiccup, but since we got the upgrade I was willing to let it go.The suite and design of the hotel and and everything about it is still near-perfect for me. I love the design of the property, and the layout of the suites/rooms. I love its location in SoMa. I love the food/beverage, from the restaurant, room service and the lobby bar. Everyone is very friendly.We did have several housekeeping mistakes, and the management response to those was less than satisfactory. Even after our complaints, housekeeping still managed to screw up, something that I'd not experienced on any previous stay at this hotel. The fact that this was the weekend immediately prior to the Christmas holiday made me wonder if the property might be a bit understaffed or under-managed. We also had issues with wifi, both in the room (which was fixed in a few hours) and in the restaurant (which was fixed in about 20 min). We finally had issues with trying to reach our butler(s) on several occasions. We would call and it would ring and ring and ring with no answer on numerous tries. That was also another first for us at this hotel. We often had to call another department to be connected to the butler or front desk, and even then it took more time than it should have. That again made us wonder if the hotel was understaffed due to the imminent holiday period.Otherwise, again, we still love this hotel. Considering that we've had nothing but near-flawless visits here, we were and are most willing to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The fact that the hotel management awarded us a free 3 night stay for next December 2016 to remedy the mistakes of this visit more than made up for us for the lack of excellent service in the instances described above. We have faith that these were unusual slip-ups, and I still look forward to returning. I also have several business trips to SF planned in 2016, and I expect to be staying here for those, as well.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I regret hear of the delays in service that you received during this visit, and sincerely appreciate your understanding and loyalty to our hotel. We look forward to welcoming you back on several occasions in 2016, but please do not hesitate to contact me directly at any time.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com
The St. Regis San Fran is a beautiful high-rise property in a great location in one of my favorite cities. The staff was highly-attentive, but never intrusive. The room service was phenommenal and always hot, delicious, and on-time. The beds and high tech window controls were wonderful too. I didn't get a chance to eat at Ame, but I heard wonderful things about the restaurant in the hotel. The bar area was always popular for cocktails and the gym was fantastic. I would highly recommned making reservations at Gary Danko for dinner, one of the best meals I've ever had! Also Boulevard and Postrio were fantastic and R G Lounge has amazing, authentic chinesse food. I also loved Taylor's Refresher along the Embarcadero for fun and delicious diner style food in an open, casual atmosphere.Overall, the St. Regis is the place to stay if you are looking for one of the best hotels in San Fran with luxury, privacy, and amazing service.
I'm a gold Starwood member and membership definitely has its perks. One place where you can definitely take advantage of great opportunities is the St. Regis in San Francisco. I've never had a less than stellar experience here. Stay in an Executive Premier guest room. Terrific value, space, design and comfort. Opt for the butler service -- always spot on and an amazing asset during your stay, from wake up service to the little touches, they anticipate your needs - the butler service is one of the hallmarks of the St. Regis experience. Gin and tonic Why yes, please.I stay at the St. Regis when I have friends in from out of town or when I just need a few days of aaaahhh time or when I'm returning from a long haul flight. I'm never disappointed. Ever. If you have the chance and the budget, do yourself a favor and stay at this truly world-class hotel.
The staff were great. Christian at the front desk was terrific and truly offered a luxury experience. Housekeeping staff did a great job and were nice enough to run my wife's bath prior to returning to the hotel (several times, sorry). Private dining breakfast was not the best but again the attendant was very accommodating. We didn't have a chance to experience the spa and pool. Only negative feedback would be that the windows were not soundproof. Overall a very pleasant stay and would return.
It's unfortunate that I only stayed one night because this is a wonderful hotel. The room was so tranquil with neutral colors and simple yet elegant and comfortable furnishings. The bathroom is well appointed with a large vanity area and a deep soaking tub which fills quickly. It is open to the bedroom but with a panel that can be closed for privacy. The bed is so comfortable with the softest sheets. The staff is friendly and helpful. Having checked in somewhat late and being a Starwood member (which was acknowledged at check-in) a request for a (brief) late checkout was honored without any problem. I have found that in general bring polite and reasonable helps a great deal with requests like these. My rate included breakfast which was fresh and plentiful. The service at Vitrine was friendly and quick. I was not there long enough to try the spa, pool or fitness facilities but the look great and I hope to go back for a longer stay and try them. My only complaint about the hotel is the cost to park. The valets are quick and friendly but that doesn't entirely justify over 50 to park for overnight. Also, and this is just a general gripe, I encountered a few spoiled and rude fellow guests who seemed to think that paying a premium for a hotel room entitles them to slam doors and be generally disruptive in public areas. It's just a general wish that people would be polite and act appropriately. I won't blather on about staying on some of the world's best hotels, blah, blah, blah. However the St. Regis San Francisco in my opinion ranks with those in terms of location, service, amenities and comfort.
What can I say it is the St Regis. This is a newer building and everything is done with taste and thought. From driving up to walking into check in, to your room. Decor: Very contemporary, but comfortable. Unlike the W which goes for modern mostly the St. Regis San Francisco keeps it clean and contemporary yet tasteful and comfortable. Great earth tone colors and tasteful art through out the building. Food: They have a lobby lounge which is great for just hanging out, having a meeting, or wanting to have a little snack. Nice atmosphere not too quiet, not too loud. They have Art of Tea which is served daily between 2-4pm and reservation are recommended, and finally their restaurant the Grill which is a contemporary dining. Beautiful dishes, great tastes and really if you just want a nice dinner without leaving the hotel you really can't go wrong, but again you are in San Francisco.. Rooms: Well the rooms as I said are amazing. Very clean, very contemporary but comfortable. huge windows allow you to see amazing views of the city and parks. Everything is automated, the bathrooms are large and comfortable. If you like the finer things in life, or want to take your partner on a romantic night this is it. Staff: Again A+ the entire experience was amazing including their staff. The butler service was on point and I really have zero complaints.. A+Dear petewright09,We appreciate you taking the time to share a review about your recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We are thrilled that you enjoyed the guestroom dcor, our culinary offerings and felt well accommodated by our staff and butler service. We look forward to welcoming you back to the best address in the near future. Warm regards,Andr BroseHotel Manager
Spent two days here prior to a conference that was being held at nearby Moscone Center.Took BART from Airport to this hotel - very easy and fast. Hotel is about 5 minute walk from the Montgomery Street station. Arrived at Noon - room was not yet ready. Front Desk attendant took my phone number and said they would call when room become available - but they never called. Not a big problem - I went out and enjoyed the sights. Came back around 3:30 and was then able to check-into my room. Was given a north-facing room on the top floor (top floor of hotel, that is - the upper floors of the building are for the St. Regis Residences). Room decor was very serene and calming. Never heard anything from outside or other quests while I was here! Bathroom was especially nice, with lots of room, wonderful amenities, rainforest shower and separate soaking tub. Everything in the room seemed fine, except for my master-control panel - some of the features just wouldn't work (phone, radio control, etc.) - I never called for assistance, just got by with using the other phone (think there were four phones total in the room). Bed and linens were OMG spectacular. Slept like a baby and felt wonderful when I woke up!Took any early morning swim in the pool - very nice - and it was great that the pool is open 24/7. Fitness center was well-equipped, and super clean.Ate Breakfast at the hotel restaurant - which was lovely, but quite expensive. Lobby bar and main restaurant looked lovely, but I didn't have a chance to experience them. Visited the Museum of African Diaspora which is accessible from first floor of the hotel - very nice place. The hotel has a great location for visiting the fine arts museums - many within a block or two - Yerba Beuna Gardens, Jewish Heritage, Museum of Modern Art. Also just a couple blocks from the high-end shopping of Union Square.If you are seeking a space of serene luxury in the heart of the SF hustle and bustle, the St Regis definitely delivers.
My husband and I just returned from yet another wonderful stay at the St Regis San Francisco. Three nights again in a beautiful and spacious Metropolitan Suite with proper blackout shades installed in 2016 per my request. Air con was great as always. Had our dog with us again, too.Service and food/beverage again were fabulous. Spectacular Platinum recognition, as always, due both to my Ambassador level status and the fact that I stay here many times every year. (I'll be back again in late August.)The only misses were:(1) Concierge had sloppy mistakes confusing our party sizes for bookings at 2* Commis and 3* Saison. Created a bit of confusion and a little exasperation when arriving at Saison and booking was under wrong name. Settled but stupid.(2) Twice had calls to butler ring way too long before anyone picked up. Pet peeve of mine.(3) Room service didnt have pork sandwich as per menu for a lunch order, then brought my chicken sandwich ordered without avocado...but with avocado--and not toasted fully. Stupid and not impressive. Replaced quickly and whole lunch order was compd.Obviously, the service recovery was wonderful in each instance. But those are mistakes that this hotel doesn't usually make.Still, we had a truly fabulous stay with amazing service otherwise. Everyone knows us by name. Butler service was fab. Packing and unpacking were great. Pressing and shoe shine were done with aplomb. Great service at the amazing bar, at the restaurant for breakfast, from the front desk, valets, everyone.This still is my favorite hotel by far in SF. And it now ties with the StR NY as my 2 favorites in the whole of the USA.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. We were delighted to welcome you back to the Best Address, and sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our associates and service. I apologize for the two misses in service, and truly value your comments and feedback. Please do not hesitate to contact us at any time, as we look forward to your next visit to the hotel.Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager
Our family of five (myself, my wife, and our three daughters) had booked a room as part of a block of guests for my wife's cousin's wedding on Saturday, onsite at the St. Regis hotel scheduled for 6:00 pm. I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival, which was the same afternoon of the wedding.I called at 2:00pm that afternoon, an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room, took down my cell phone number, and would call me when it was ready.We arrived around 2:30pm, stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready. OK, we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away, and away, and away! My wife went back and asked for our room because we had to get prepared for the wedding! While the desk personnel were apologetic, they tried to offer a handicap accessible room, which we did not want. Then they tried to blame the situation on the fact that we had booked a king room on the reservation block for which they had already written and confirmed we reserved. The clock is ticking past 4:30pm ... and finally we get our room keys!We hurry outside to where our bags have been sitting on a luggage cart, tell the attendant that we have our room and need our bags immediately to prepare for the wedding, now about 1 hour away! We thought our bags would arrive on the heels of our entering the room, but NO ... again waiting ... so we started to prep the younger girls ... still no bags!My sixteen year old daughter went back down stairs and found our bags had not moved! She was livid ... and finally got them to start moving the cart. It was 5:15pm by the time our bags came. I understand that porter was just doing his job, when he asked if he could set up our bags in any particular place or if we needed ice, or how to operate the room controls ... but at that moment our immediate needs were for him to get the bags in the room as fast as possible and to leave so we can dress for the wedding! We all rapidly threw ourselves together ... my wife having triple duty ... in order to arrive a few floors down for the wedding.The entire experience of checking in was horrendous. From the call to confirm at 2:00 pm until we got our room and finally our bags! Not one of the hotel staff exhibited any sense of urgency for our situation. To appease us, they offered and we accepted to park our car onsite for a free night.On an afternoon full of anticipation for seeing family and friends at the wedding and reception (also at the St. Regis) ... we went through a tremendous amount of stress from that check-in experience. We're seasoned travelers so we can and have handled the ups and downs of travel ... in this case, I had to double my normal 24 hour rule for posting a negative review, because I'm still fuming. A five star hotel such as the St. Regis should never have their guests wait 2 hours past their own published check-in time to access their room.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize on behalf of our entire staff for the extended delay upon arrival to your room and the multiple inconveniences that were caused to you and your family. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may further discuss the details of your stay, and how we may improve this unfortunate experience. Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057Anthony.dugganstregis.com

Have spent five nights in this nice hotel perfectly located , only couple of minutes from Union Square.We had two connecting rooms accomodating five of us, both perfectly decorated , very spacious and well maintained. Staff is extremly friendly and willing to help. With my youngest daughter have also used pool which is quite largem, clean and not crowded. Only complaint is cost of in room wi-fi access (this kind of hotel should have it complimentary) as well as breakfast arrangements - although waitress are helpfull and polite - 20 minutes to get eggs and croissiants is not acceptable (and also quote expensive)Dear Guest,We would like to thank you for taking the time to review The St. Regis San Francisco. We are pleased to hear that you and your family had a wonderful stay with us and enjoyed our room dcor and hotel amenities.

Recently stayed at the St. Regis at the beginning of July. Our stay at the hotel was amazing and it was made even better by the friendly staff. The concierge, Eric, was extremely helpful in recommendations of where to eat and also what wineries to visit. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco.Dear Melissa C,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

Very smartly located next to the Metreon and the conference center as well as the MOMA. If you are in town for a conference this is for you!If you are a tourist then this is not your best bet as this hotel sits two blocks South of Market St.Suites are very large and boast a dining room, a TV area with a large sofa, a separate bedroom and an expansive bathroom (separate toilets). Amenities are from Remde so top of the line. You will find those products in their Remde spa as well (located on the 6th floor).Gym + indoor pool.Metropolitan suites come with a 24/24 private butler service but expect a VERY slow service. If you order a bottle of champagne to treat your big clients in your suite expect to wait at least 30 min.No coffee maker, no tea kettle, nothing that you can make yourself. Each and every cup of coffee/tea must be ordered through the butler service and expect another long wait.No extra comforter, pillows.Summary: nice and large suites but service can definitely be improved.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to review The St. Regis San Francisco. We are pleased that you enjoyed our guestroom dcor and spa amenities during your stay. I appreciate your comments about the Butler service, and apologize for the inconvenience that the delay caused you. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may discuss the details of your stay and how we may improve your experience. Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057
What a wonderful hotel!!! 5 nights in a room with a great view over the Gardens with hills and sunset in the background. Service is over the top. I think St. Regis has figured out how to know what I want before I do. The food in the restaurants was very good. Concierge staff knew their stuff - great recommendations for places to walk, restaurants, etc. Surrounded by nice museums. We had a great stayDear Guest,We appreciate your review on your most recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am pleased to hear that you had a wonderful experience at our hotel. It also delights me that our associates delivered uncompromising and bespoke service to you during your visit. Thank you for your feedback and we hope to host you again upon your next trip to San Francisco.Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057
My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights because of the close proximity to Moscone Center, the art museum and great shopping, and of course because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. (How did we ever travel before Trip Advisor) Loved our time here. We requested and were given a quiet room - on the 17th floor. Everything about the St. Regis is stylish and modern (though not as great as the St. Regis in Manhattan). I loved the TV in the bathroom. Minor annoyances - the tv remote didn't work - probably dead batteries there was no price list for the overpriced wine in the wet bar - it took 20 minutes to have one sent up the electronic control center on the nightstand acted up a few times, turning the lights on in the middle of the night and I find it annoying to be charged extra for the wi-fi use (15/day). Regarding a couple comments posted earlier about the hallway carpeting, I loved it - a really fun design element. (will post a photo of it) We had the best meal of our stay in the hotel restaurant. The lap pool was warm and beautiful and empty - unfortunately I forgot my suit. Too bad the spa didn't have a basic suit to sell, like they do in some hotels. I would happily stay here again. By the way, San Francisco,what's up with the homeless people on your streets I've never seen so much panhandling and yelling and screaming and craziness and was actually afraid in some situations.
As with any St. Regis, the level of service here is incredible. I had to stay for a few days for business earlier in the year and with a tight schedule, the hotel and comfort level of sleeping was really important to me.Rooms are very well designed. Bed is very comfortable. Staff attends to every and any need that you might have. I can't say enough good things about their attention to detail and customer service.Dear OnlySane,Thank you so much for taking the time to review your most recent stay at the St. Regis San Francisco. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and enjoyed a restful night's sleep! We look forward to welcoming you back soon to San Francisco's 'Best Address'!Warm Regards,Andre BroseHotel Manager

One of the top stays in the U.S., stayed in a suite with an adjoining den.Excellent quality of service including kid size slippers and robe - unbeatable at most other hotels.Ambiance in the hotel is nice, and room is very clean and well appointed.Highly recommend staying here.
This hotel is everything you would hope for. Beautifully appointed. Great comfort. Good restaurants and bar. Excellent location. And most of all, a superlative staff.

Astonishing with this hotel was the old building left in the middle of shopping centers, high buildings. The tram station was just outside as Wallgreens beside.HM and Macy's etc. What do you ask more for a perfect location I had probably the cheapest room, but it was just perfect. A bath tub to relax my pains. Breakfast wasn't included, but who needs that if there are a hundred places nearby to eat every hour of the day. Hop-on-off buses leave just 100m away. It was just sooo perfect. Early reservation is highly recommended
This the first time to San Francisco that I have not stayed in the area of Fisherman's Warf, and the Hotel Vertigo has changed my perspective of San Francisco. The Warf is a great area, but it is all tourists. When we go to SF, we like to walk (a lot) and visit the places the locals go. The Hotel Vertigo is in a great location for branching out all over the city. And, on those days when you just want to hang out - there are plenty of restaurants and bars within blocks. Hotel Vertigo is a seven story boutique hotel. Over the last couple of years I have made the decision to only stay in boutique hotels, and Hotel Vertigo does not disappoint. The rooms are small, but very well appointed. It is apparent that my room had recently been renovated with modern chic. The bathroom was huge with a great rain shower head. The room was on par with some of my recent stays in Madrid and Mexico City. Excellent WiFi coverage all over the hotel. My only complaint was that I had an inside corner room (709) on the 7th floor that adjoined another room. The door to the adjoining room was not very sound proof so I almost clearly heard TV and conversation in the next room. This was only a problem one night for about an hour before a fell to sleep after a long day of exploring the city. The staff here are amazing. They were always ready to help us with directions, taxis and recommendations. The rooms are cleaned very quickly each day with great detail. My friends have been staying at Hotel Vertigo for years and I'm glad they convinced me to stay here this time. I'll be back in a few months with my girlfriend and I know she will love the Hotel Vertigo. Dear Cortesokc,Thank you very much for your comprehensive review of your experience in San Francisco while staying at the Hotel Vertigo. I'm delighted that took advantage of our location and neighborhood feel along with the wonderful interactions you had with the Housekeeping and Front desk staff. We look forward to you returning with your girlfriend to the Hotel Vertigo!Regards,Luis Morales
We stayed there for 2 nights and staff were very friendly and helpful. It was in a great location and quite central to restaurants and cafe's. bed was comfy and bathroom was nice and clean. I would go back again if visiting San Francisco.Dear Julie M,We certainly appreciate that you took the time to share your review about your recent stay with us and the Trip Advisor community. We are pleased that you enjoyed our accommodations and service! We hope to welcome you back on your next trip to San Francisco, thanks again!Best regards,Haiyi Hotels Worldwide
Great location, close to Union Square and bus routes but not right in the middle of all the noise. Convenient grocery stores and coffee shops nearby. The front desk staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We arrived early and they were quick to arrange an early check-in for us. The rooms are modern and well-appointed. The lobby is bright and comfortable. We were so pleased with our stay. This is a great value in the city!!!
we enjoyed the hotel but it needs more amenities-they were building a new cafe-but there was no bar /gym/breakfast-which is a pity as it is a great building which they have improved.the room was good sized and clean.however the price is way too high for what you receive.Dear tigerdw,We certainly appreciate your feedback about your recent stay with us and are pleased that you enjoyed our hotel. Indeed, you are right, we are currently building a new cafe and wine bar, which will set to open this Fall. In addition, our new fitness center and business center will be open then as well. We hope to welcome you back on your next visit to San Francisco!Best regards,NickHaiyi Hotels San Franciscofor Hotel Vertigo
We booked through Orbitz, which included a 'non-refundable' policy. We asked to reschedule (not cancel) due to a death in the family. Vertigo denied the request via Orbitz. We were disappointed that Vertigo couldnt afford more flexibility. Consider booking elsewhere if life might happen.Hi Mark N,I'm disappointed and sad to hear that Orbitz did not communicate your request to modify your reservation. Orbitz is the company that charged you and could refund your credit card directly as I communicated this to them as well. I wish you would have booked directly to avoid 3rd party issues with these companies and hope you called me directly so that we could have accommodated your request due to this unfortunate incident. Please contact me directly at 415-885-6800 and/or email me at jgonzalezhaiyi-hotels.com so that I can assist you in this matter.Jaime Gonzalez
Had such a fantastic stay, rooms were fabulous, staff were helpful and always there to help, take away coffee in the morning was a god send to start trekking down to fisherman's wharf approx 30 minute walk and 10 minute walk to union square, fabulous location. Caf across the road open from am for early birds and convenient store and sandwich stop on same street.Dear Maz M,Our location is perfect for those visiting Union Square and all the sights of San Francisco. Our highest aim is total guest satisfaction and by sharing you would be inspired to return we know we have done our jobs well. Thank you for choosing to stay with us and leaving this generous review. We hope to welcome you back soon!Luis MoralesHotel Manager
Spent 3 nights at the Vertigo and can't really find anything to complain about check in was quick easy and friendly, our room on floor 7 was clean, big enough for us and fairly quiet other than an italian couple who deemed it acceptable at 7am to laugh and chat at the top of their voices! Walls are quite thin Used gym which was good for a hotel this size decent coffee in room and downstairs, good location for union sq and other neighbourhoods all In all a pleasant stayDear DJH1973,Thank you so much for your 5 star review - I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you did not let the loud couple affect your wonderful stay at the Hotel Vertigo. We look forward to having you again as our guest!Warm regards,Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
Would recommend for couples-close to a very good restaurant Nobb Hill cafe and walking distance to grace cathedral. Most tours will pick up at this location as well. Free printer ATM and fitness center all made our trip much more convenientDear Alexis,Thank you so much for your fantastic review. We love to hear about our guests enjoying the facilities so we are pleased that you left Vertigo Hotel with wonderful thoughts. We are also happy to hear that you enjoyed the Wine Hour we currently have. Again, thank you for your thoughtful review. We look forward to your next stay in San Francisco!Luis MoralesHotel Manager
Great value for the money and good location to explore SF. Beds are very comfortable and rooms are clean and good size. Only complaints about the room are lack of a comfortable chair and the dresser. The dresser is in the closet and is difficult to access which is annoying during a long stay. There is no exercise room (supposed to be coming) and no business center or conference room ( also supposed to be coming).Would stay again, but just aware of limitations.
We stayed here for five days in the beginning of November. The location is fine for exploring San Francisco, close to transportation and only about ten minutes away from Union Square. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our early morning wake up call for the half marathon was as requested. We really enjoyed our stay. The coffee in the lobby is great for early mornings.Thank you so much for your review and the compliments about our location, coffee and our friendly staff. I'm delighted that you had a good stay and that you had fun running the half marathon. We look forward to having again.Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
The hotel has a central location and we stayed here in October 2011 (room 301), therefore we booked again this year. Some upgrades are required such as the Wifi which was very slow or did not work at all(room 601). The beds are very comfortable, but the technical standard is not in accordance with the high room rate. Shower system should be changed in order to save high water consumption (general water restrictions in California).Nice staff Vidar A. B,Thank you for sharing the details of your experience both positive and negative during your stay. I have contacted our Internet provider as we had an upgrade completed 3 weeks ago increasing our bandwidth along with wi-fi upgrades to meet the higher demands and usage of internet. In the future when making reservations please feel free to reach out to me directly for assistance at jgonzalezhaiyi-hotels.com. We hope you give us another opportunity in the future to exceed your expectations.Best,Jaime
Very good stay and excellent value for money. Friendly staff and quiet rooms (though no view) it was a great base and one I'd be tempted to use again. It's central Ian big US city so yes they're small but otherwise very good. Staff lovely and location excellent - worth wandering up Hyde or Polk to union for some lovely SF fun. Only downside was that they don't have a car park but they have a good deal with the secure public lot at 840 Sutter - just 200m away.Dear Matt W,Thank you very much for your review of our hotel. I am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay and wanted to let you know how much we appreciate your taking the time to share your experience on Trip Advisor. We look forward to welcoming you back as our guest on a future visit into San Francisco!Best regards,Nick DalisayArea Director of SalesHaiyi Hotels Worldwide
Check in staff were so helpful and cheerful. We arrived quite late and was promptly checked in so we could do rest. The room was spacious and very clean. Shower cubicle was spacious. Toiletries included. Not the best of locations in San Fran but by far not the worst either. We enjoyed the walk to Fishermans Wharf. There's a hop-on-hop-off bus stop fairly close too. Great value for money Dear Kate G,Thank you for choosing the Hotel Vertigo during your recent visit to San Francisco. We appreciate your feedback regarding your experience with us and are delighted to hear you enjoyed our accommodations as well as the excellent hospitality provided by our team. We look forward to welcoming you back to San Francisco in the future!Best regards,NickHaiyi Hotels San Franciscofor Hotel Vertigo
Booked online without taking proper account of location which is in an area which is looking rather tired and feels a bit downmarket. Reception area was undergoing some refurbishment. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.Stay was okay and room basic and comfortable but would not want to stay so far from Union Square on next visitDear industryvet,Your comments about your stay with us are much appreciated and we thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us! Glad to hear that our team provided you excellent hospitality during your stay. We hope to welcome you back to San Francisco on your next visit.Best regards,NickHaiyi Hotels San Franciscofor Hotel Vertigo
A nice clean hotel, a little away from all the attractions but a nice friendly hotel. At the time of our visit there was some refurbishments going on, but did not cause any problems. Do not expect any views from this hotel as it in the middle of the town.Dear hylton h,Your comments about your stay with us are much appreciated and we thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed the accommodations as well as the service of our team. We hope to welcome you back to San Francisco on your next visit.Best regards,NickHaiyi Hotels San Franciscofor Hotel Vertigo
We stayed four nights at the Hotel Vertigo. It is a great location for many San Francisco attractions if you like to walk and take the cable cars. There are many bars and restaurants near by as well. The room is clean and has all you need. The desk staff is friendly.
Booked thru booking.com and got a great rate. The room was very nice and the location is very convenient. I would advise not walking too far down the hill on Leavenworth towards Market. It gets a little seedy, but every other direction is perfect for walking around. The service was great and the rooms are updated. The decor is very nice as well---- room walls are not sound proof in the least, so light sleepers take warning!
We booked a 2 queen bed room and were given one with 1 queen bed which seemed like a dungeon. The room looked out onto a brick wall on the ground floor at the back of the hotel - it was awful, very depressing. Asked to be moved and got a lovely room at the front of the hotel on the 6th floor. Apart from that the hotel was good. A bit of a walk to the centre but not too bad. The staff very very helpful and friendly.
Nice spacious and modern room. Two large double beds.There was a nice gym that i used everyday which had just enough equipment to keep my happy.Walking distance to union square and most places aren't too much in a cab.Nice coffee in the room and in the morning downstairs.I would recommended this hotel. Dear Blackrose31,Thank you for an outstanding review! We are elated to hear how much you enjoyed your stay. We sincerely appreciate the time you took to provide your comments and feedback. We are pleased that you enjoyed our gym, the complimentary coffee in the morning and great location! We hope that you'll join us again soon, and we look forward to your return!See you soon,Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
Loved The Vertigo! Rooms were unique. Hotel was very clean. It's not a 5* hotel but staff was so very helpful. Free wi-fi in the room. Very nice location! Walked to chinatown and Union Square. The only complaint: We were offered a breakfast with our rate and the yogurt was warm. They just had a boxed breakfast sitting in the back room where It should be in the fridge. It's better to go 2 doors down to the breakfast place. It's inexpensive and the food was good. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The men that worked the front desk were the best. They could answer anything and were very helpful. Can't wait to go back someday!
1st time we went to this hotel in SF. I was a little cautious with low expectations due to the decent deal i got online with them. Only good surprises: Very nice staff, used to deal with international visitors and making the effort to speak other languages. Rooms are a little small but their design is tasteful. We had a comfortable bed, enjoyed a quiet sleep with almost no noise. If the hotel does not provide breakfast other than Coffee or tea, there' s a chinese 'diner' type at the next corner that will fulfill your needs for cheap.I ll go back there for my next trip in SFDear NicoCT,Thank you so much for offering your comments. I do appreciate you taking the time to recognize our staff, the great deal you found online and to our convenient location. We hope your travels lead you back to San Francisco sometime soon.Best regardsLuis MoralesHotel Manager
I was looking forward to giving this hotel an amazing review, but I can't our last night was the worst! I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work, but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...Dear espy610,Thank you for your detailed review of the amenities and the friendly staff that assisted you throughout your stay. I have passed on your compliments to Sean and I want thank you for the opportunity you gave me to resolve your issue. As our reviews indicate we strive to provide superior customer service, impeccable rooms and make all of our guests feel that we have exceeded their expectations. Per our conversation please reach out to me in the future for reservations if your travels lead you back to San Francisco.Regards,Jaime
Stay for 2 nights on October with my wife. The hotel decoration is very classy, from the lobby up to our room. Check-in and check-out is very smooth. Location wise, even it is close to some major attractions (Union square, etc) but also close to Tenderloin which make us feels a bit insecure (not their fault btw). Only problem is on our last day just before check-out when we waited for the lift for nearly 10 mins. We've got to drag our heavy luggage and found out that the lift is out of service. At least put some sign on each floor that the lift is broken. Otherwise everything else should be ok.Dear Andai,We are so fortunate to have you and your wife as our guests this year in our hotel. We thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. More importantly, we are glad our staff was able to have a smooth check-in and check-out for you. We do apologized for the lift breaking down on your last day with us, we do thank you for your feedback and we will definitely take the appropriate measurements on notifying people when it breaks down next time. We look forward to seeing you again and we appreciate your kind words.Luis MoralesHotel Manager
Hotel Vertigo was perfect,stayed in room 305 street view very clean,spacious room,lovely shower. Close to union square 10min walk area felt safe despite others previous comments. Definitely recommend.Hi Tandy, Fantastic! Thank you so much for your perfect review! We hope you visit us again the next time back in San Francisco!
Location is fabulous, we walked everywhere as it was so central to where we wanted to go. Rooms were clean and staff extremely helpful - it was our first time in San Francisco and they sorted us with eating advice, cheap hop on bus tickets...Special mention to Cynthia, Ayala and Greg on reception who were great!
The hotel has a certain charm all its own. Although the Vertigo has no restaurant , there were plenty of places nearby to choose from. It was cheap, clean and had free Wi Fi. The staff was courteous and helpful. The rooms did lack adequate drawer space and were a little small. The bathroom was cool- I liked the rainhead shower and the H20 products and the flat panel TV. I would still recommend The Vertigo to anyone wanting a inexpensive place to stay with personality.
Although this hotel could use a new coat of paint (which it appears they plan on doing in the new year), our room was clean, quiet, comfortable and inexpensive. I think the age of the hotel added to its charm and set it apart from most of the hotels I generally stay in - giving it character. It was definitely unique and the staff was very nice. They even upgraded our room upon our arrival. I definitely recommend this place if you want a location that is relatively close to downtown/union square without paying for the price of a downtown/union square hotel.
I really liked this hotel and the nice little features in the room. Also, it has a decent gym and the location is also good, maybe 15min walk to Union Square. On the other side, if you are in the wrong room, you can hear your neighbours talking. Even though, the hotel wasn't booked out and they had plenty of rooms available, they put us in the room next to the elevator. During that night, I didn't sleep more than 30 min. After complaining, they gave us a different room which was much better. But why not giving us a quiet room in the first place!Dear Tim E,Thank you very much for your review I am happy to hear that we were able to accommodate you in a quieter room resolving the noise issue. I am also happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and we hope you will be returning soon to the Hotel Vertigo.Warm Regards,Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
I want to like the Vertigo Hotel. It's quaint. It's charming. It's off the beaten path. And its staircase has a Hitchcock movie connection. It is one of many renovated small hotels in San Francisco. I like boutique hotels. While it's several blocks from Union Square, I easily walked it. Its a bit closer to the Tenderloin and I suppose the nearby grittiness adds to the charm. It's a neighbourhood hotel, not in the middle of the city and touristy madness. The staff know the area and make good suggestions for restaurants and things to do.With respect to usability, especially for business, it leaves a lot to be desired. The wifi is slow. It is shabby and worn. At one point the Orange in the lobby was bright and modern. Now it is faded. Check in includes instructions on how to use the shower because it is not obvious. The website says parking is available but fails to mention it is either expensive valet or several blocks away. In the final analysis, while adequate for business, it is better suited for visitors on holiday. I am glad to have had the experience of staying there, but will probably choose another hotel for my next visit. And yet it remains charming.
Stayed a weekend. Good facilities and friendly staff. I dont agree with the worn down hotel statements. I thought the rooms were great and clean, looked newish.Location is also good, not in the middle of touristy FW, but in walking distance 20min.Dear TomERob,I shared your comments with our entire staff and it makes me happy that we are able to provide exceptional service. Thank you so much for your 4-star review as it validates the pride we take in creating a memorable experience at the Hotel Vertigo for every guest.Best regards,Luis MoralesHotel Manager
I spent a week at the quality inn suites in Palm Bay while visiting friends. I learned something new. The king size bed suite is cheaper than two queen beds.

We went on a family vacation last June with our kids (10, 8, 4) and our friend recommended that we stay at the Hilton Universal since we really intended to visit Universal Studios since they have a free shuttle that goes around. We didn't have our own car and we had our friend bring us around the city.Rooms were big enough with 2 double beds to accommodate all of us though a little dated. Not much restaurants and shops in hotel and nearby -- mainly good if you're planning to go to Universal Studios.
This hotel is conveniently located near downtown Seward, Alaska shops, the waterfront, Aquarium, eating establishments (and bars)!

West Bank Inn is a nice motel with large beds, a bathroom that works and an average selection of complimentary breakfast products. Nothing fancy, but you cant expect more for the rate. Take a stop, have a good sleep and move on.

This has been one of the most accomadating hotels I have ever visited. Whenever I come to this area I book this hotel.

We were there in winter so there was nothing happening outside. The casino had adequate slots but not much in the way of table games. We did quite well on penny slots......for a change.

First, I didn't expect much more for this price, it was clean and that is my number one concern! Bed was a little hard for us, parking limited, breakfast limited, but fair accommodations for the 50 ish price. Staff was nice.
Customer service was really good and they were really friendly. Price for this hotel in Jonesboro was really really good. I stayed for 2 weeks for business trip and had no issue. They have updated to flat screen. I did not expect breakfast to be included in this price, so that was a bonus.
Older cabin but great price for 9 women to have girls retreat . Clean but would have been nice ro have washer and dryer. Secluded and quiet. Had a great weekend . Beautiful fall tree colors. Weather was great.Glad you enjoyed your stay! We will take into consideration the washer and dryer. Good idea!
This hotel was very clean and nicely decorated. The shower in the King size room was great. The only bad thing I can say about this place was at check out time. My husband checked out ahead of me and while I was carrying down luggage to my car, I had to leave a few items in the room to... More
Staff were great!! polite and professional, always available. Continental breakfast is small but satisfying, Coffey's always fresh, rooms were clean and neat. I would highly recommend this motel to friends and family
You won't regret your stay here. Beautiful scene, amazing area, and personalized stay. They even have cookies in the lobby! I love the bungalows that sit behind the hotel, it feels like your own cabin!

Our family stayed here for one night after a hockey game. The hotel was super clean, right off the interstate, and was located around a few restaurants. The staff was wonderful also. We definitely would stay here again.Thank you for five star review! We are so happy you found the hotel to be super clean and the staff to be wonderful! We look forward to seeing you in the future!
Excellent, would definitely stay here again , even though we arrived early we were made to feel very welcome . The room was very comfortable, the Jacuzzi, swimming pool ( heated ) and sauna were superb.
My partner and I booked this hotel expecting a high-end luxury experience. What we found was a rather worn and tattered, rock-n-roll hotel with a dated atmosphere. The room was clean, but again, a little worn. The service was okay, but our room was not ready when we arrived a bit early, but we were told it would not be ready for over an hour AFTER check-in time. We were able to check our bags at the desk, and we went for an early cocktail, but chose another place once we saw the kind of seedy bar. Room service was quick, but the food was just average. I have a feeling this outpost of the W brand is in for a major shakeup. The price of rooms here is high, and I just don't see why. We also stayed at the Hyatt Olive 8, and the experience was MUCH better. I would skip the W Seattle. You will not get what you pay for.Hello JJHappyTraveler, many thanks for your recent review on your stay at W Seattle. We apologize that we missed the mark with you and your partner. Our goal is to provide a fabulous experience for our guests, and when we fall short of that, we take it very seriously. Thank you for providing feedback, as we use all comments to improve the guest experience. We do hope you will give us another try and allow us to WOW you as you should have been this time. Thanks again.
Picked the W for a weekend trip with my boyfriend and wanted to stay somewhere trendy downtown. We were most impressed with the bar - friendly service and great menu (tater tots poke plate were fab!). Booked a spectacular room with a view. View was just looking at a big building (see pic), not a cityscape like I hoped, but I suppose thats the nature of being downtown. Probably would save money on that next time. No fan in bathroom so there was some humidity in there. I also requested a 4pm check out but they could only do 1pm. No big deal and wed still stay here again. Great location and lot of food/drink options within walking distance as well. Thank you for taking the time to share your review Lisabonvoyage, we're happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and were able to take advantage of our location.
The rooms were functional but not of the W quality I'd expect. I'm a SPG gold member and was treated nicely and had complimentary drinks but I doubt I'd stay at this property again. its close to the trains and is walkable to pike market but that's all I can say for the hotel. They need any/better art work on the walls. A little texture could help too. I'm not an interior designer or anything close but I know I can do better.Hello KevnLA310, Thank you so much for your response on your recent experience at W Seattle. Our apologies that it wasn't the experience that you had hoped it would be. We do appreciate all of the constructive feedback, as we are always looking for more ways to make our guests' experience more enjoyable.
We had a nice room - view wasn't the greatest (looking at a parking garage). Hotel location was great - near many things including the Farmers Market. Staff was great! - very helpful. Mykaela helped us along the way answering a bunch of questions and checked us out - remembered us by name! Kyle helped - and booked a tour for us. Cleaning staff had the room immaculate every day. All in all, a great visit!Hello RZ52,Thank you for your feedback. I am happy you enjoyed your stay and service of the hotel. I hope your travels bring you back some time soon!Warmest Regards,Nadia
I stayed here 1 night for an overnight layover in Seattle. The hard product isn't particularly special, but my entry-level room was decent, with a comfortable bed, good lighting, conveniently located power outlets, and modern yet unoffensive decor. The view wasn't bad either, with the Space Needle visible in the distance as well as a comfortable couch by the window. In contrast, the bathroom was mediocre, with a shower/tub combo, relatively weak water pressure, and sterile design compared to the rest of the room/hotel. I did have to call to request slippers as I couldn't find any in the room, but they were delivered swiftly.In the past I have steered clear of W hotels due to the impression that they are more style than substance, but the service here was actually very good. I was warmly greeted upon check-in by the friendly clerk, and the concierge desk was also more than happy to recommend some nearby places for a quick dinner (I ended up going with Heartwood Provisions, which was excellent).Hello Oliver L, thank you for your review on your recent stay at W Seattle! We are thrilled that although it wasn't expected, you loved our service! Our team works hard to make sure our guests are well taken care of, and it sounds like you were. Also, thank you for your other comments as we are always looking for new ways to improve our guest experiences, so it is very valuable. Thanks again!
Stayed at the W Seattle hotel for 2 nights and had an excellent experience. It was my first time staying at a W hotel property and am definitely going back. From the first point of contact at the front desk (I think the woman who checked us in was namedMikala), to the restaurant staff, and housekeeping - everyone was so welcoming and kind. The rooms were very modern and clean. Good amount of space and great amenities. Hotel is conveniently located within blocks of Pike Place, restaurants, and shopping. I prefer to not stay too close to Pike Place because of the crowds. Starbucks is located right across the street, which is great if you need coffee every morning. Not sure when I'll be back in Seattle, but I'm definitely staying at another W property soon. Thank you for your comments Elisa, I will share them with our talent at the Welcome Desk and Trace Restaurant. We do hope your travels take you to Seattle again soon and we are certain you will enjoy your next W Experience as well.
The same feel and vibe of other W hotels though lighting in room was better than others I have been in. Love the Bliss products. Didn't try the bar or restaurant this time but have in the past. Was decent.Hello Debra R, thank you for your review of your recent stay at W Seattle. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay. Our team works hard at making sure our guests have a great experience here, so all feedback is incredibly important to us. Thanks again and we hope to welcome you back next time you are in the city.
W Hotel is a fun and energized hotel because its design. I like W's location and the Bar because I can easily go to many stores and the pike place, and I can enjoy my drink while I enjoy the music, which denoted by DJ. I believe you would fall in love with this young energy musical style W Hoel. Hello Erica C, we are so pleased that you enjoyed your first trip to Seattle, and that you decided to stay with us on your first trip! We agree with you on the location of the hotel, so close to so many of Seattle's hotspots! We do hope you will come back to Seattle and stay with us again! Thank you!
I have been staying at the W Seattle since 2010 and have never stayed anywhere else in Seattle as I enjoy my stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the cool corners are very nice. The staff over all these years is consistently hospitable and friendly. And the location is ideal, easily accessible to all of Seattle. I very much recommend you give it a try, and maybe you too will become a regular.Hi there foodplan!Thank your for sharing your kind words and feedback! It means a lot when we can have someone stay with us for as long and consistently as you have. Please keep us informed on all your future stays go, because we hope it's as good as all the previous ones.Jana
Check the boxes for a great location and a clean room. That said, this W seems to lack the pop that other W's have. There's nothing special, trendy, or quirky about the rooms. .. a bit of a disappointment. I was also a bit put off by not having a coffee pot available in the room. Although there was coffee available in the lobby, I prefer to get up and make my own. No big deal. In fact, none of this is a big deal... it's just not what I expected when I booked based upon past W experiences. Yes, I'd stay there again.Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. Hope to see back soon!Thank you,Nadia
This W is in the heart of all the action. I got a mega suite which overlooks the bay and the city and had a great leather chair to look out the window. The property is in line with most W's, hip, with upbeat energy. The only downside is there is no Bliss spa. The Trace restaurant offered a wide variety of great food. The bartenders were on point, fast, friendly and attentive. The MOD, Anthony was very kind in fixing an issue with my bill, as well as Bryan, who checked me in. Tyler, the bellman was extremely efficient with my luggage at check-in and check-out. I will definitely stay again. Breakfast was very good as well as the service. The housekeeping was on point daily and cleaned my room when I requested, which is not always the case in a lot of SPG properties. Hello Amber D, many thanks for your response on your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay and loved the hotel. Our team works hard to make sure our guests have a great experience, and it sounds like you did! We also agree with you, we would love to have a Bliss Spa as well! We looking forward to seeing you again!
As seasons ticket holders for the Seattle Seahawks, we typically drive down from Vancouver then drive back up after the game. This time, we decided to make a night of it and stay at The W Seattle. Received a pre-stay message from W Insider, Mykaela, with great dining recommendations near the hotel. As it was our first night away from our baby boy, I replied back to Mykaela to see if she could set up a special surprise for my girlfriend. She replied back and was excited to help out with my little request. When we arrived, we were welcomed by Rachel, who was inviting and funny, and got us into our room. When we entered the corner room with a west view, right on the desk was a amenity and card from Mykaela, wishing us a happy anniversary, along with the little surprise for my girlfriend a stylishly framed picture of her and our baby boy so that she wouldn't miss him too much. After checking in and refreshing from the drive, a short walk took us to Century Link Field, just in time for kickoff. After a win for the Seahawks over the Eagles, we walked around the city, popped into a little Mexican joint for dinner, then back up to the room to enjoy the city view and Stellina Di Notte amenity.The next morning on our way out, as we were waiting for the elevator, the room attendant on the 17th floor greeted us from another room and thanked us for staying. Nice acknowledgement.At check out, Mykaela was at the desk and got the chance to thank her in person for the personalized service. Stored our bags for the morning to grab brunch, before heading back up to Vancouver. Short but really sweet stay. Thanks W Seattle...and Go Seahawks.WOW, what a fabulous review, and I am thrilled that we were able to make it special for you both! And we agree, Mykaela IS amazing, and we are thrilled to have her on our team! We appreciate you staying at W Seattle, and we hope to see you back next time you are in the city! Thanks again and GO HAWKS!
Spectacular lobby and very friendly staff. Good bar and attentive service and they mix a damn fine martini. If you're looking for any sort of view at the end of the day - take a 3 block walk to the waterfront and enjoy - because there's not a view to be had from your room.(we had 6 people there in all different rooms) It is a great location - close to most of the best spots in Seattle. The rooms are comfortable, but not worth the non-corporate rates. I would have been embarrassed to charge breakfast on my corporate card because it was so overpriced. So avail yourself to one of the many coffee shops.Hello Michael C, thank you so much for your feedback. I am very pleased to hear that you enjoyed W Seattle, and yes we agree that our martinis are amazing! Our staff pride themselves on great customer service, so I am pleased to hear that you thought so as well. Also, thank you for your comments on our pricing, hearing that helps us to understand our guests more, and make changes to improve our guests experience. We hope on your next trip, you will visit again, and enjoy another fine martini!
Love the W Seattle, it is close to everything in downtown and the service at the hotel is great. We had a nice time in the bar/restaurant as well. It is a great area to hang out and relax as well as talk to friends. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet and clean.Hello ggpmb, many thanks for your fabulous review of your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you had a great time and enjoyed the hotel so much! Our team works hard to make sure that our guests have a great experience, and it sounds like you did! We hope to welcome you back next time you are in the city. Thanks again!
Even though I've worked for a W property in the past, I had never stayed in one as a guest so I was super excited when we had enough points saved up for a 2 night stay at the W Seattle for our 1st anniversary. Upon arrival, Nina (super sweet and friendly) assisted us and let us know that our room was not ready yet so they stored our luggage and said they would email us when it was ready. We never received an email but headed back around 4pm and it was ready. They had defeathered the room per our SPG profile and even upgraded us to a Cool Corner Room. I was so excited! Their W Insider (concierge) had emailed us prior to the trip and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We told them it was our anniversary and he was able to upgrade us as a surprise. Along with the upgrade, was a bottle of champagne on ice and some homemade gummy bears which totally put a smile on our faces. That's hospitality at its finest. The room was super clean and the view was amazing with 4 large windows. The room also had a really nice chaise lounge that couple be separated into 2 seats or combined for 1 lounge. It was really comfy. The W mattress is also really comfy and I liked that the bed was lower to the ground. The AC was also really quiet which provided us 2 nights of really good sleep. In the evenings, they had live music in the Living Room and after 9pm they had a DJ so it was sort of a party atmosphere at night but no noise could be heard from the room aside from city street noise. Overall, we had a great experience. The staff always greeted us when we walked by and the valet guys always opened the doors for us. I hope to visit again soon!PS- it's a 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. No need to rent a car as everything was within walking distance. WOW, thank you for sharing about your recent visit 882triciam, we appreciate the opportunity to be part of such a special event! It sounds like you were able to take advantage of our location to check-out everything Seattle has to offer, including some live local music in the Living Room. The team works hard to make sure our guests every need is met and I'll be sure to share this with them.
We had a lovely stay. The room was lovely, beds very comfy, air conditioning good, nice modern decor, bathroom and toiletries lovely. Bar food and staff lovely. Super central location - All in all a lovely place.Thank you for sharing feedback about your recent visit Amelmato, we're so glad you enjoyed your stay.
Convenient to everything downtown. A Starbucks across the street. Early check-in wasn't a problem. Complimentary New York Times. Spacious room with a comfortable bed. Also an easy and enjoyable walk to Capitol Hill.Hello RPK16, many thanks for your response on your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay and the hotel. We agree with you, that the location of the hotel is perfect, so close to almost all of Seattle's hotspots. We looking forward to seeing you again!
The room was far below my expectations. I arrived at 1am and was given a handicap room with chipped paint and generally not clean. I expect so much more from the W and so much more the cost. I think I would have had a better experience at the Hyatt or Marriott. Very disappointed Thank you for providing your feedback mandeez, I am sorry that we missed the mark with the room you received during your recent stay with us. We take these things seriously and will review with our staff in order to improve our service and your experience in the future.
The W's location was super convenient, just a few blocks from the Market and waterfront. The staff was so accommodating and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious. Overall great experience and I will definitely come again one day!Thank you for the great review 886raquelj, we are glad you had the opportunity to take advantage of our great location and visit the Market and waterfront. We look forward to seeing you again on your next visit.
Note! If you drive a short box truck regular size you cannot valet! They said our truck was too back and told us to go to self park. Didn't offer to take our bags. 60 per night parking! We self parked next door for 39 per night and lugged our luggage down stairs. Front desk didn't care and they booked us in 2 doubles instead of one king. She upgraded us for 20 bucks. The corner rooms are cool! Robes, mini bar and lots of Windows. Rooms are great. Comfy bed. Cool lounge in hotel. Happy hour wine is 6 between 4-7. But service there was not that great either. Too bad. Nice stay just service could improve Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. Be sure I will be following up on the issues you mention. Regarding parking, we offer valet parking 24 hour with unlimited in and out benefit, therefore the difference on price.Thank you very much for staying with us.Warm Regards,Nadia
Downtown hotel that was hard to find as entrance/parking garage is around the corner from the actual address. The sign out front is very small. Overnight parking is exhorbitant we used a garage 5 blocks away, although there are others closer by. Room was interesting L shape with view over street. Furnishings were all fine although 2 lightbulbs were burnt out. Staff was helpful, but busy. Pub next door is half the price (or less) than hotel restaurant. I noticed traffic noise, especially truck honking early in morning and siren that went by. Not a poor hotel, just not my style for visiting a city and making everything convenient.We appreciate the feedback jerryg, to make your next Seattle visit as convenient as possible I would be happy to connect you to our W Insider who can assist with local arrangements. We are glad you found our team helpful and we're working on some better signage for our entrance.
We'd stayed in this hotel about ten years ago, when it was very hip happening. Now, not so much. Still, the room was fine, the bedding good, and the cleanliness what you'd expect for a higher end hotel. Not sure what's up with the very loud air conditioning, though. Even on its lowest fan setting, the noise level was so high that my husband and I had to raise our voices to be heard. Overall, an okay experience in a hotel that used to be much more than okay.Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. I am really sorry about your experience with the Air Conditioning in your room. Warmest regards,Nadia
I found this hotel quite comfortable to stay at. Business conditions required that I work overnight and sleep during the day, and the blackout curtain was quite effective at keeping out light. I almost never heard any noise from other rooms or the hallway either, and city noise was nonexistent away from the window (except for the occasional siren). Hotel staff was very helpful with any requests. The exercise room has a lot of equipment for workouts. The bed was very comfortable. Room service is a bit pricey.Hello Daniel S, many thanks for your great review on your recent stay at W Seattle. It sounds like you were BUSY while here! I am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the black out shade as well as the room stayed nice and quiet for you to get some rest! We do look forward to welcoming you back next time you are in the city. Thanks again!
We had a great stay at the W. The vibe was Seattle cool with live music in Friday night in the lobby. Rooms were modern and clean. Great location to all the attractions, including the light rail from the airport Hello Caryn S, many thanks for your response on your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay and the late night atmosphere! We agree with you, that the location of the hotel is perfect, so close to almost all of Seattle's hotspots. We looking forward to seeing you again!
Had a good stay at the W Seattle. Wanted to give a 3.5 rating for this hotel. Good and convenient location. About 15 minutes walk to Pike Place Market and 5 minutes to many shopping stores. Lots of restaurants/dining options nearby too. Stayed in a Spectacular room which were fairly spacious and modern. I liked the Bliss product toiletries in the rooms. There is a Nespresso machine in the room. They didn't have any tea/kettle though. Staff were friendly. Their whatever/whenever service is pretty efficient. Now for some of the cons. The temperature in the room was difficult to regulate. Every tiny adjustment would make the room either too hot or too cold. There aren't enough towel bars or hooks to hang towels in the bathroom. The gym was unkept. Noticed some used towels and opened water bottles laying around. Upon check out, we requested for a bellman and followed up two times and no one came. Ended up bringing everything down ourselves and noticed bellmen in the lobby who apparently weren't aware of our request. They were pretty friendly so not sure if it was just some miscommunication between the hotel staff. Had a good stay but not sure if I would stay here again because I wasn't wowed as much as I thought I would be staying at a W hotel. Might go back to staying at the Sheraton Seattle.Hello Kenneth L, thank you very much for your review of your recent stay at W Seattle. So glad to hear that you had a good stay, but I apologize that we missed the mark on some things for you! Our team works hard here to provide great customer service, so your feedback is incredibly valuable to us to improve those experiences! I do hope you will try us again next time and allow us to WOW you as we should have done this time. Thanks again.
Very friendly and service minded staff. Hotel is nice and modern, located only 10 minutes away from the popular fish market. Had a great stay here. Our drawbacks are minor, but iron and iron board was in very bad condition (hardly usable), water seemed too soft, low water pressure in the shower, and a USD 68/night valet brought it down from 5 to 4 for us.Hello HoustonAndre, thank you so much for your review on your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you had a great time, and enjoyed the hotel. Thanks for sharing your feedback on the valet prices and the iron...my apologies that we missed the mark on those things for you! I do hope that we will see you back at the hotel next time! Thanks again!
This was our first time in Seattle. The first part of our stay was at another hotel but we had to change to the W due to availability. I wish we had just stayed the entire trip at the W. The staff was excellent and the room was amazing. We had a huge room on the 25th floor with a view of the sound as well as the Space Needle. This was the first time we actually spent a great deal of time in the room since the view was spectacular. I would absolutely stay there again should we return to Seattle. IN ALL CAPS TOO, I LOVE IT! We are thrilled that you ended up with us and LOVED it! We wish you would have been at W the whole time as well! The views from the room are AMAZING, we agree! Please let us welcome you back anytime! Thanks again!
I was impressed with this hotel from the first minute. The staff at the reception desk are immediately warm and inviting. Next I was wowed by the spacious room with a view. The room is beautifully decorated with a fresh modern feel. I love that the toiletries are from Bliss, another touch that makes you feel pampered at your home away from home. Thank you W!Climber37987589218 Thank you very much for your review! We look forward to welcoming you back next time you are in town!
Centrally located, close to Pike Place and other key points of interest. Room was spacious, but unfortunately, I really missed their wonderful Heavenly Beds! They must not have these beds at this location, as one of the receptionists hadn't even heard of the Heavenly Beds! Further, the water pressure in my room, located on the 10th floor, was abysmal despite having housekeeping try to make an adjustment to the shower head valve. The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well, as I had a late check-in (10pm), and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar, which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma, the pleasant check-in receptionist, asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger, more satisfying water pressure.Hello WillinLa, thank you so much for your feedback on your recent stay at W Seattle. My apologies, as it sounds like we failed to meet your expectations during your stay. We are always striving to make our guests' experience an amazing one, so your comments are extremely valuable to us to ensure we can make that happen. I do hope you'll give us another try and allow us to WOW you as we should have the first time. Thanks again.
Hotel is very clean, beautiful and in perfect location. Love that you can walk everywhere but overnight parking is a bit pricing. I requested a view of Elliott Bay and pay a little extra to get the higher floor for the view, it was disappointing - NO VIEW! Overall the stay was comfortable and love the cleanliness of this hotel!
We stayed in two rooms for one week. The hotel IS IN the convention center. Had I know this, I would have booked at a smaller place. As a result, it was very crowded and there was no real personal attention. The rooms were clean and offered lovely views. Club level was worth it. Sadly, my young son lost his treasured baby blanket at the hotel. (we think in the laundry). And there were many many tears over that. I think more from me! We asked several times with several people, but it was never found. We are still heart broken.
We stayed here over New Years to celebrate our anniversary, and the hotel went out of their way to make our stay pleasurable. Not only did they provide great service, but we also had a killer view of Pike's Place and the Space Needle from our room. It's also in a great location where you can walk to everything (note though: parking is 30 a night in their parking garage, so you may want to find parking elsewhere). We will be back to stay here again.
We live in Seattle but needed to get the baby out of our condo while it was cleaned. He had been sick for two weeks and needed fresh air while our tiny place was being cleaned from top to bottom. The guy in reservations got us a hypoallergenic room with a gorgeous view, crib, baby bathtub and baby products for a discounted rate. Mommy baby got much needed RR. Thank you! We will be sending our friends and family to the Grand Hyatt for the great service, beautiful rooms and gorgeous view! Room 2319 was perfect!
I've found the Grand Hyatt to be a well located place to stay when visiting Seattle. The Pike Place Market, which is a must see, is a pleasant 10 minute stroll down the hill. Other tourist attractions e.g. the Seattle Wheel, the Aquarium etc, are approx a 20 minute walk. There are plenty of quaint places to eat including the larger franchise eateries close by.The rooms themselves are spacious and well equipped. The bathroom has a walk-in shower as well as a bath. There is a writing desk as well as a chair and ottoman, so you are able to relax and put your feet up.We were on the 27th floor, with a water view room. Nice outlook of Puget Sound.
The Hyatt is situated right in the city. Its a 5 minute walk to Pike Markets and the shopping district.The staff are really helpful. The rooms are pretty standard but the bathrooms are amazing!If you prefer a shower with 2 shower heads, one on either side, ask for a room with this option. My work colleague had a huge bath instead in theirs.Would definitely recommend.
My husband and I booked a room here over the past Thanksgiving for two nights when we flew in from North Idaho to celebrate the holiday with our son and his family. The room was comfortable and had nice amenities. Ruth Chris Steak House is attached to the hotel which serves fabulous meals. Expensive but very good quality. As with most Seattle hotels parking is very expensive-around 45 a day and even 30 to self park so our son picked us up when we arrived and then we took a town car when we had to return to the airport. 65 included tax and gratuity and was arranged by the hotel concierge, Molly, who was most helpful. She also told us about the train to the airport but when she said you have a half mile walk from the station to the airline counters we declined. Only around 3.00 so if the weather is good (ours wasn't) and you don't have a lot of packages (we did) it would be the way to go. You can catch the train only two blocks from the hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping, eating or theater going in Seattle. Very close and easy walking distance to major stores and lots of wonderful small ones. Also located next to the convention center so very convenient for that too. We were disappointed to come back from shopping at almost 2:00 and find our room had not been cleaned as yet. We also did not care for the heating system. It has a vent at the top of the wall and when it came on it blasted your head with cold air when you were in bed. Don't understand why it was cold as we had it on heat. These were the only two negatives and we would definitely stay again. Our room was very quiet except for when the idiots in the corner room next to us let their door slam about 12 times around midnight. I was just about to call the front desk when it stopped. They had a nice business center and allowed you to web check in for your flight for free but charge to use the internet.
The staff at this hotel always exceeds my expectations. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Not to mention the excellent location. The business center staff went out of their way to make this business meeting successful. Quick walk to the seafood market and the original Starbucks and Nordstrom. Highly recommended!
The location is perfect. It is an easy walk to any of the Downtown or Belltown attractions and only about a 15 minute walk to Capitol Hill. I attended a conference at the hotel and the staff was very courteous and helpful. My flight arrived in the morning and the hotel was able to accommodate an early check in (at the time I just asked to drop off our bags). The room was clean with a great king size bed and a large soaking bathtub. Overall outstanding service and experience.
I have stayed at many of the major hotels in downtown Seattle. I believe the Grand Hyatt delivers the most value for the dollar and would recommend it to others. The location is convenient, the staff is very professional and personable, and the rooms are very well appointed and quiet.
Can't go wrong with this hotel. Beautiful rooms and super close to all activity around town. It's situated on 8th street, so a leisurely walk down to 1st takes you to the Pike St markets. Hertz rental car is also based in the car park of the building, so really convenient if you want to drop off or pick up a rental. Staff all really helpful and really pleasant. We had a great stay.Thank you for your notes. We love that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily get to great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. Please come back and see us on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
Great place to stay. Room a little small. Clean, Quite, People very nice, and Great food Banquets a little shakey i.e. spoiled snacks, lapses in table attension and bar service. Good access from airport by lite rail.
Stayed there a few weeks ago and it was excellent. Right downtown.a short 10 min walk to the market and 15-20 min walk to sky needle and pioneer square. a few blocks from the hustle and bustle, but plenty of activity right around the hotel. Rooms were very clean and up-to-date and all staff (car , bell, desk) very friendly and accommodating. Concierge (forgot her name -- sorry) was especially helpful with any arrangements, printing tickets, directions..etc. would highly recommend this hotel.
Just around the corner from the Convention Center. Very convenient! Rooms are very clean and the bathroom is large with a separate tub and large glassed shower. Quiet room. You really cannot hear anything, so it's great for work and sleeping.
Beautiful hotel with plush amenities, polite and helpful staff, great location with a short walk to Pike's Place Market, the Westlake mall, the Monorail pickup to the Space Needle, coffee shops on every corner and great restaurants all around the hotel. Super close to the convention center, too. Great view of Puget Sound along Pine St from room 2520!
Ok, for those that are wondering in Seattle where to stay, I successfully picked out the two hotels that are close to all attractions, reasonably priced and had a jacuzzi for helping with the soreness of the feet from walking around to all the attractions! Grand Hyatt and the Sheraton. I had stayed at the Sheraton, which had a nice jacuzzi on top, but wanted to try the Grand Hyatt. We pulled in, had a room readily available, and went to our room. The bathrooms are huge and my wifed loved this. No complaints about the room. The hotel had a nice gym where I was able to workout in the morning with a few of the LA Angels prior to playing the Mariners. Very nice gym with a connecting jacuzzi area. They also had a sauna and a very large and hot! steam room. Connected to the hotel is a really nice Sushi restauant, which if you like sushi, you should check this out as the dishes roll around the restaurant on little conveyer belts. They also had a NY deli style place to grab sandwhiches and a Starbucks. I would stay here. They guys running the valet are very professional as you could tell they know their stuff. The front desk check in was very pleasant. But, one word of caution...nothing to fault of the hotel but more the city of Seattle. My wife and I fell asleep Sunday night around 8pm, thinking we were going to wake up and head out to a restaurant. At 12:15 am, I was out of luck to getting any type of food. Room service closed, so the only thing I could purchase was small little crackers and cookies from the front desk. Not a big deal, but you would think in a city that size you could walk to some place and get a sandwhich. In the morning, I didnt see breakfast, so I think it was all room service. BUT, dont eat there, walk 6 blocks to the Pikes Market and go to Le Panier or Poscky's for pastries. Wonderful Go there early and beat the lines! Eat breakfast at Lowells for crab-dishes.
I first stayed at the Grand Hyatt Seattle soon after it opened about 8-9 years ago. I remember loving the hotel. It was new and modern and in a great location and ever since I've always loved it. I recently revisited it and was worried that it could now be showing its age. I'm happy to report that these worries were completely unfounded, the hotel is still amazing. There's a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel, as well as a Starbucks and a sushi restaurant. The staff is very helpful. And the location is great for anything in downtown Seattle, either business or pleasure. But my favorite part of the Grand Hyatt Seattle are the rooms. They are modern and I just love the layout of them. As others have reported, the bathrooms are huge, and the whole entry area of the room has stone floors instead of carpet. The views from the upper floors are also amazing, especially on an unusual clear day. I had room service twice and each time it was good and came quickly. Overall, it's a great hotel. I highly recommend it.
I only stayed for 1 night but it was great. Location was close to pike street market and shopping. Updated and clean rooms, large bathroom with separate shower, and electric blackout shade! The staff were all very friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs.
This hotel is a beautiful property. My room was spacious, modern and luxurious. The staff was friendly and I felt at home. This hotel is right next to the Convention Center. There is a Starbucks connected to the hotel. The fitness center included machines, free weights, a hot tub area, steam room and sauna. Thank you for taking the time to share feedback on your stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your room and that it felt like home. Our goal is to make sure you feel welcomed and comfortable. It is nice and convenient to be so close to the Convention Center especially since no umbrella is needed as the walk is fully covered. Hopefully, you had some sun during your stay! We are very proud of our fitness center and are delighted that you were able to make use of it.I will pass along the compliments to our staff as we want to make every guest feel at home in our hotel.We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to Seattle!
The Grand Hyatt Seattle is located one block from Convention Center and easy walking to the market and great restaurants. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. The room is nice, clean well appointed with free Wi-Fi loved the automated blackout shade. The Ruth's Chris in the lobby has two happy hours with great appetizers. All in all a nice hotel. The only complaint is the minute you step out the panhandlers hit you up and very aggressive.
Second stay at this Grand Hyatt. Both experiences were very good. Rooms nice - not great but very clean. Some hall noise in room but hotel fairly quiet even though pretty full. Location is very central to both the shopping area downtown, pike market, and capital hill not far walk. Staff very helpful and friendly.
Decided to stay somewhere in the heart of Seattle for my birthday. We wanted a place with a bathtub big enough for two but unfortunately the tub was not big enough for one. Room 2920 was comfortable and had a view towards the west with Elliott Bay in the background. You will hear noise from traffic below. I was also disappointed with the thin bath towels. You'd think a place this nice with these room rates would of offered better, thicker towels. The very large shower had some black mold in spots that contrasted with the white marble. Charging for bottled water seems cheap too. Self serve parking 30/day is a bit steep. Seems to me that they could give guests a discount on the parking fees.
Just completed a one night stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We were very happy with everything and can't complain. The staff was professional and courteous. Everyone from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was friendly and always greeted us.Jason checked us in immediately and was extremely nice, efficient, and welcoming. The house keeping staff does a great job in keeping the rooms clean. The decor was modern, the bathrooms beautiful. We were upgraded at no additional charge to a corner suite, maybe because of our Platinum status or maybe because it was a monday. The view was amazing and we loved the electronic blinds and huge room. There is a great shuttle run by Gray Line that takes you to the hotel for 17 dollars round trip, 10.25 one way. We only took the shuttle from the hotel which left at 15 minutes past the hour and 45 minutes past the hour. It was right on time and took less than 45 minutes including two stops at other hotels prior to arriving at the airport. Much cheaper than a 30-40 dollar plus tip cab ride. We have gone to the restaurant Brooklyn on this trip and our last trip also. The entertainment book provides a buy one get one free coupon for it and the food although pricey is worth it. The entertainment book provides many buy one get one free coupons to local attractions including the art museum, Victoria Clipper, aquarium, and others. The hotel is in a good location to attractions and shopping.Pikes market is a straight 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. It is right next door to an awesome movie theatre and the Cheese Cake factory. If you can get a great deal this is a hotel that I would go back to.
I absolutely agree that the location is great. You can take the Metro from the airport, get off at the Westlake Center and walk three blocks to the hotel. Convention Center is 2 blocks away. Here are the pluses and minueseROOMI upgraded to a King view room. Suppose to be a nicer room on the 24th floor or above. The room was the exact same room with the exact same view as a friend had on the 21st floor. What I will say is the bathroom is fabulous. Soaking tub and separate shower, large vanity, robes. But the quality and quantity of the towels didn't live up to the rest of the bathroom. FACILITIESThere is no restaurant, no bar, nothing. There is a Starbucks around the corner. Its very odd given that the hotel has a small conference center. There is a Ruth and Chris' Steak House next door but the bar there is very small. And a major downside is that the lobby smells of cooking meat from about 3:00 on.Great work out facility. One of the best I've seen.Executive lounge is okay but doesn't have the amenities of Hilton, marriott, Westin etc. BREAKFASTWe had a AAA package that was suppose to include a full breakfast. It turned out to be that a very small continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge with an additional chaffing dish of eggs and a meat CUSTOMER SERVICEIt was okay during the stay but had major trouble with my bill. I got charged 3x the room upgrade. I called in to customer service and told that I was mistaken on the cost of the upgrade and that there was no way I could have gotten information to the contrary because it would mean a flaw in the reservation system. Fortunately, I still had a copy of the e-mail that showed the correct amount. When I sent it in I did not get an apology or anything even though I explained how challenging it was to have to deal with credits etc. with my company. Still waiting for the credit to show up on my card.
Checked in the day before leaving on an Alaskan cruise. Had nothing but a grand experience. The hotel is a couple of small blocks away from the monorail that goes to the Space Needle and other attractions. Our room was clean, reasonable size, huge bathroom. Even though we were close to the elevators, the rooms were very quiet. Would definitely stay there again + was a really good rate, several dollars cheaper than near the pier. No complaints!
Without a doubt this hotel is beautiful, immaculate and the staff is very courteous. I would expect no less of a hotel of this caliber. What blew me away was their friendliness and hospitality toward our one year old baby boy. When they found out we were traveling with a baby we were placed in a beautiful corner room with a separate area for our son to sleep. Anyone traveling with babies will understand how valuable this is! You can hear the traffic noise on the street below but we traveled with a white noise machine that blocked the noise. We requested a travel crib and they delivered the crib already assembled with extra towels and wash cloths and a set of travel size Johnson and Johnson bath products. These little touches made this mama's heart so happy! I would give more than 5 stars if possible.
Everyone there was amazing and the prep before my arrival was stellar. They ensured I had access upon check-in to the Olive 9 property so my son could take advantage of the swimming pool. Room service was great and the views from our hotel were fantastic.
I am more accustomed to staying at Park Place Hyatt's than Grand Hyatt's so I had to adjust my expectations. With that said, the lobby is nicely designed as are the rooms. But half of the hotel has bad views regardless of what floor you are on. A few times we requested extra towels and a few other items like laundry service and each time the staff promptly helped. That was appreciated. So was the quick check in. The rooms are a little tight but the furniture, especially the bed was comfortable. The towels in the bathroom do not know the meaning of soft and that was a bit disappointing. I am highly attuned to smells and the room was overwhelmingly fragrant upon arrival. This is something that I could have done without. As is the ridiculous fee for the wi-fi. In this day age it is insulting when a hotel charges for this service. It feels like they ought to charge to use the alarm clock while they are at it. If it were not for the Internet charge I would give this hotel a 4-star rating. But the charge feels like a thorn in my side so they get a 3-star rating.
We were given a beautiful room overlooking Pike's Market and the Bay. Nice size rooms and wonderful bathroom. Staff was welcoming and remembered our names as we went in and out of hotel. Well located for all public transportation and restaurants. In the middle of all the best shopping. Walked everywhere or took public transportation wherever we needed to go.Thank you for taking the time to review the Grand Hyatt Seattle. Our hotel is perfect for the recreation or business travel and is conveniently located to public transportation and many Seattle attractions. I am pleased to hear that our location, guest rooms and friendly staff made your stay enjoyable. Lindye W.Guest Relations Manager
The Grand Hyatt in Seattle is always consistently great! I am greeted on sight by my name and the staff always remember my preferences and inquire about my needs. The room standard is very high quality and comfortable, providing much needed respite from traveling. I am a frequent traveler and prefer the Hyatt over most other brands.
Had an extended weekend stay to celebrate big anniversary! This hotel looked very nice and had a perfect locale so we took a chance. We made a great choice! The hotel is perfectly clean and very large. We got a suite with a bay view and it was perfect. We even had a view of the famous red Public Market sign! No trouble locating Pike's Place with that view! Room was spotless and bed super comfy. Pillows are little lacking too soft, no support but we still slept really well. Check in was a breeze. When they heard it was our 25th, the gal comped our valet for the entire stay and sent up a bottle pinot grigio! We appreciated her thoughtfulness and enjoyed the wine. Bathroom is luxurious and spotless. Huge shower and separate huge tub were glorious! First time spending a significant amount of time in Seattle and we loved every minute. Thanks Hyatt, we'll be back!
World class, clean, great location, modern design, almost next to the convention center.
I stay at a Suite at this Grand Hyatt at least 2-3 times a year for at least a week each time. I can say, with a degree of certainty, that they've stepped it up significantly. It's undergoing a renovation. The staff is exceptionally courteous, helpful and professional. I received a letter from Mr. Robert Morrison (Area Director of Rooms) and the assistance of Mr. Steve Vissotzky (Managing Director) and Ms. Sarah Sawatzky (Executive Assistant). I was impressed. I can afford to stay where I wish and it's changes such as this and the staff that make me want to continue to come back.
We had the best experience at this hotel. The staff was friendly and cordial, the amenities were exceptional and our room exeplified luxury. We stayed on a corner suite with windows facing dt and the bay and it was spectacular! Most comfortable beds and pillows ever and incredibly modern. It was the best place to go to for our anniversary. Centrally located as well.
The Seattle Grand Hyatt gets high points for location and room quality. You can ignore the complaints about the price of parking, because there is no need to bring your car here. All of the downtown attractions are within easy walking distance, as are the train to the airport, light rail to Lake Union, the monorail to the Seattle Center, and buses to pretty much everywhere else. If you're allergic to transit, the hotel will call a cab or car service for you. And if you truly enjoy driving in traffic, there are cheaper places to park nearby. Be sure to ask the concierge for information on discounts to museums and events. If you want to work out, the gym is fabulous, with lots of high-quality cardio and weight equipment. Bring your swimsuit so you can enjoy the sauna, steam room, and whirlpool. And, although as a rule I don't believe in room service, especially in a city with such good local restaurants, the breakfast that we ordered in-room compared favorably to the best food we had anywhere else - good fresh fruit, excellent bread, local cheese, perfectly-cooked eggs delivered hot, top-of-the-line condiments and a not-too-sweet yogurt parfait. Really, you can trust me. It's worth it.
Used up the last of my Hyatt Gold Points for a mini Sta-Cation at the local Grand Hyatt. It was a very choice. I paid for an upgrade to a corner suite, with a view... Of more buildings Not sure I needed to see more of the buildings.Five stars for me on this!Overall, and very nice hotel, very clean, well appointed rooms, plus the corner suites are very large, with a separate sitting area, bathroom, and bedroom. All very nice.Hotel reception was nice, very nice young man who checked us in, good sense of humor (which is very important, that he understands my jokes!). Bell man could have acknowledged my wife and I walking through, but decided to stare blankly out the door... Not sure about that (long day I guess).Sampled the attached restaurant for Happy Hour, which was very nice.Wish our Sta-Cation could have lasted longer, but we needed to head home.
Have stayed at over 30 Hyatt properties, this one was among the best I have seen. Exceptional property, exceptional service. Really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and appreciated. Would definitely recommend.
We have stayed in many hotels in Seattle over the years. The Grand Hyatt is one of the best hotels in town. It's location can't be beat and the staff is always very nice. I would always recommend this property to anyone traveling to Seattle as it's one of the best run Hyatts in the USA.
Stayed just 1 night then moved to a different hotel by the Mariners stadium for the game. The hyatt was very classy as they always are. Spendy, but you get what you pay for in the service and quality of the hotel.
ask for a good view- particularly, you can get one of several rooms with a direct view of the space needle. the prices are reasonable for a big city, and the rooms are fairly spacious. the rooms are clean, and the lobby and common areas are quite nice. a ruth's chris in the lobby is a plus. service is great. this is convenient to pioneer square, pike's place market.Thank you for your comments. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. It's so great that our amenities and location make it easy for our guests to get to restaurants and entertainment. We would love to welcome you back on your next trip to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
We have stayed in many of the downtown Seattle hotels from the hip to the old school and this is by far the best hotel - great service, airy and well appointed rooms - everything works like it should in this price range. We especially liked the location - you can walk everywhere and the neighborhood around this hotel feels safer than some other downtown areas... the hotel is especially convenient to the light rail network so an easy trio in from the airport and a short walk.Our only minor quibble (and this is minor in the big scheme of things, but an area Hyatt may want to look at) is charging a 1/bottle of drinking water - in a 300+/night hotel the water should be free and plentiful!
Stayed here while attending the US Open. We came a few days early to enjoy Seattle. This hotel had been recommended to us by friends who live in Seattle. The location was so central we were able to walk everywhere! Very friendly staff from concierge to housekeeping. We stayed on the concierge floor and ate breakfast there each day - food was great and service was wonderful. This is a well run hotel in a great location. Would definitely recommend it.
This hotel is located a few blocks from the Westgate Link station, so you can easily get around Seattle. Pike Market is a short walk and you can even walk to the waterfront if you like. Check in service is excellent, the front desk and the hotel workers are always friendly and willing to help out. Room is very clean with a large bathroom. My only complaint is the ice machines are not located on all floors, although the hotel says they can someone up with some ice for you. Also the safe in the rooms are located on a high shelf in the closet, see pictures, if you were a short person not sure you could even use it.The hotel does not have its own restaurant, you need to walk next door to the Ruth Chris to eat, but they were open for breakfast. There is a Starbucks and a small convenience store near the hotel.Although the hotel had some minor issues, I would stay here again next time I visit Seattle.
What a great hotel and a fantastic city. Three days was definitely not enough. Front desk staff were amazing and room was more than comfortable. Revisiting is most certainly on the cards for this one.
Recent trip to Seattle and stay at Grand Hyatt were great. The hotel is clean and the staff were all very welcoming. The location of the hotel could not have been better. The convention center is close by and shopping is right outside the door. It is within walking distance to the Pike Place Fish MarketThank you for the review on your stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We pride ourselves on providing the best customer service and we are pleased to hear that you encountered this during your stay! We are located just a few blocks from some major attractions, but we are very close to public transportation as well as great shops and restaurants. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future.Brenna N.Guest Relations Manager
Grand is the right word. Location is Grand, Check in was Grand, room was Grand and the Club was Grand. A shout out to Louise the Concierge, I will call her the Grande Dame of the Grand Hyatt for helping us book a luxury wine tour at the last minute. When you book on the Club level you have a choice of a room with combo bath and shower or a walk in shower. The walk in shower is pretty Grand. This is a high end hotel 400+ a night so a good place to use your points.
The entire experience was great and satisfying. The staff, the facility, and the environment was very conducive and comforting. The free wi-fi was excellent, the food was fantastic and the proximity to downtown as well as to the Space Needle was priceless.Thank you for your review on your guest experience during your stay with us at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We love that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily shop and explore all the great spots that Seattle has to offer. I am so happy to hear that you felt comfortable and relaxed in the room as making sure our guests feel accommodated is always one of our goals. We would love to welcome you back on your next trip to Seattle.Brenna N.Guest Relations Manager
We stayed in this hotel for a week. The staff was great, room had lots of great amenities, walking distance to Capitol Hill, pikes market, the space needle, and a shopping malls. Also, great views of the city. I will definitely stay here again on my next Seattle visit. Thank you for the amazing review! We love that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily shop and explore all the great spots that Seattle has to offer.

It was nice to stay. All facility was excellent but expensive. I know this grade of hotel must be expensive but I am not going for my personal travel. My friends stayed with me and his room was kind of old. Shower was not working well. Anyhow most of services are just great. Thank you.
I came for a conference, paid 30 for an upgrade to a corner suite (when reserving), well worth it. Living room, separate bedroom, large bathroom and closet. Great location at the east side of downtown by convention center, near the freeway, light rail to the airport (and underground stations for downtown buses), and Capitol Hill. Room was quiet, clean internet 9.95 a day. Hotel was modern decor, lots of wood, pleasant atmosphere. Ruth Chris is in the lobby, very good for lunch (didn't have breakfast or dinner there, so many other good choices nearby). Would definitely consider staying here again (though I'm a SPG Platinum elite).
We enjoyed our stay at the Seattle Hyatt. Helpful staff and a great location close to shopping. Sign up for their rewards program - at no cost - and get free Wi-Fi and other freebies. We were upgraded to a corner suite for only 12.00 additional per night. Suite was very nice and we appreciated the extra room.
The hotel is alright. It serves the purpose for sleeping. They don't have a bar, they recommend Ruth Chris Steakhouse for every food or drink need you might have!There was something in the air in the room that was allergic to me. I was fine once i left the room. I am allergic to pollen and dust. The rooms are well kept.
Planned weekend getaway to celebrate a birthday. Upgraded reservation to club level to have access to grand club which essentially provides breakfast and evening snacks and beverages. Worth it. Pro: location to downtown and walking distance to Pike's market. Grand club breakfast was outstanding. Gym, sauna, and hot tub are fantastic. plenty of places to eat near by Cons: 30.00 self park, 50.00 valet parking. Petty issue but double beds are not ideal for comfort.
I decided to try a new property for my frequent business trips to Seattle and I am so glad I did! I found the Grand Hyatt to be superior for quality, comfort and value. The room and bathroom were very generous for a city property it felt more like a lush studio than a hotel room.
Great location, as well as wonderful, caring service. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt in Seattle. Good catering for our meeting with local, sustainable foods. Rooms are spacious and provide vast views of the city. Parking is expensive (30 per night)
Located on Pine, near the Convention center, this hotel is first class. The rooms are nicely appointed and very comfortable. Compared with other major cities the prices are reasonable. It's easy walking distance to local attractions, plus it's just a short walk to the Monorail station that goes to the Space Needle.Thank you so much for your review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay and that the room and property amenities made your stay a great one. It is a wonderful thing that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily shop at the flagship Nordstrom store, Pacific Place as well as hop on the Monorail and quickly get to the Space Needle. We would love to welcome you back on your next visit to the Seattle area.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
My wife and I stayed here while visiting Seattle. The property is ideally located, near the monorail, close walking distance to the market and shopping. The staff is very professional, the hotel is very clean, secure and quiet. I have no complaints. I recommend upgrading for a room with a view of the harbor.
What a pleasant surprise. I stayed in this hotel because I was attending a conference. The rooms are greatand I am picky. The bathroom was nice with granite/marble (who can tell the difference anymore). Bed was great. Nice size room. Really nothing negative to say. I am typically a boutique hotel kind of guy for vacation, but if you are looking for a nice hotel in downtown Seattle, this is not a bad option. I stayed at the W before I moved to this hotel. I liked this hotel better than the W. Quite a statement coming from someone who has stayed at several W hotels around the world and recommend them. If the rate is decent, consider this option. It is typically that big hotel feel, but worth the stay.
I stayed at the Grand Hyatt because I was attending a downtown Seattle conference and it was one of the selected conference hotels, although not the main hotel. I was upgraded to a corner king suite the room was very nice, and convenient since I was with my husband. Two separate rooms always makes life easier on the road, especially for a longer stay.The overall look of the hotel, including our room, was very fresh and pleasant. Very clean as well. We like the fact that many Hyatts now share space with Starbucks--very handy and a nice low-cost option for breakfast.The hotel lived up to our expectations, which were not too high since it is not positioned as a luxury hotel, in most ways. We did find the service a bit off. It seemed as though there were too few staff available to help--long lines at check in and out--but then that may have been a result of staying over a holiday weekend.
Great hotel in the center of Seattle. Hence, easy walking to whole downtown. Mark, the manager was delightful. Kristen another manager was very helpful. We came over from Hyatt at Olive. Their hot tub was out of order. No problem to give us a room in the Grand.Hope to return again and again. I like that they offer free wifi in the room
Seattle has so many great hotels it was hard to choose. We only sayed one night prior to our Alaskan cruise, and it exceeded expectations. Beautiful, clean, marble bathroom with soaking tub, great toiletries. Comfy, clean bed, great service. Decent view of the city. PERFECT location. The whole experience was a pleasure and we will return.Thank you for the review and compliments for the Grand Hyatt Seattle! I truly hope you will be able to come back to Seattle and spend more time with us. We look forward to your next stay.Lindye W.Guest Relations Manager
best experience ever, not a single issue at this hotel. gorgeous room, comfortable bed and linen. quite room would definitely stay here again on my next trip. this room even had electric shades . what else is there to say
Large hotel in the city, but quiet and incredibly nice-in a very nice area. Easy walking to great stores and local venues. We had a corner suite on the 24th floor-great views of the city-with a ton of room. Love this hotel will be back for sure.
We stayed for 5 days in a hypo-allergic room on the 23 floor, facing east. It was quiet and private and cleaner than any room we've ever stayed in. Everything was first rate from maid service to vehicle valet. Starbucks on first floor as well as New York style deli and Ruth's Chris restaurant. Originally we wanted to stay closer to Pikes Place Market but this location turned out to be more centrally located. We plan on staying here again next year.
I loved my stay here. It was very easy to get around and walking distance to a lot of attractions. Train station and monorail was close. The market was close and you could find anything to eat you wanted close by.
Stayed in a bay view room at beginning of week as well as a city view room at end of week.. Bay view room was larger and had great views toward water. City view room was nice but smaller. Good location for all things near waterfront. Monorail to Sky Needle just a couple of blocks away. Would definitely stay here again...
We booked the Hyatt for our weekend in Seattle to see Steve Martin and Martin Short.The hotel is dog friendly and in walking distance of the Paramount theatre where the show was at.The parking isn't the best here but it's Seattle, so it's expected. We paid 35 for overnight parking. Once you get parked just walk everywhere, I love walking around Seattle.The only complaint I had was the pet fee changing from the time I booked it until the time we actually stayed. The fee had gone up 50. I didn't complain or say anything because I just didn't feel like having a dispute about it. I also wish they'd had an area for the dogs to do their business, luckily I always carry poop bags, but my Dog had to go very suddenly on the street because I couldn't find a green space close enough, so I just picked it up of course.I guess with big cities it's harder to have an outdoor area for pets.Now to all the great things, which was pretty much everything.The lobby was beautiful, nice lighting, everything was clean, there were large hallways and huge ceilings.Our check in was quick, easy and friendly.We were given a room on the 29th floor with a great view of the city.The room had huge windows, it was a really clean room, spacious and beautiful.The bed was really comfy and also very clean.The Bathroom was massive and I really mean that, it has a gorgeous soaking tub, walk in shower, toilet and vanity area. You have lots of amenities with this hotel.There is a nice hallway space and an awesome do not disturb button that turns a light on and you don't have to hang something on your door, loved that.We had food and drink options that were attached to the hotel in the front, which is always nice for a quick and easy option.We ordered room service with our TV remote. The breakfast that came was delicious, very prompt and with friendly service.We slept amazingly with the fantastic bed and black out shades.When we came back into our hotel on the Saturday afternoon/evening before the show we got on the elevator with a Seattle Mariner, that was pretty cool.Everything about our experience here was perfect from the moment we arrived to the moment we sadly left.This was a bit of a splurge but I hope that one day we can stay here again.I also wanted to add that every staff member I encountered was always friendly to myself, my DH and our Dog.Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle for the show.
The Grand Hyatt in downtown Seattle offers an extremely comfortable a spacious room, with a nice view from the upper floors that face west. The bathroom is large, with extremely nice shower and bathtub. The room is quiet and well insulated from sounds from other rooms, although you emergency vehicles driving can be strangely loud. You can open a small window to get some fresh air too.Thank you for your note. We love that you were able to relax and feel accommodated. Our goal is always to make our guests feel welcomed and comfortable. We hope to see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
The location is great. Close and easy access to shopping and Pike Place. Rooms were very nice and comfortable. Front desk wasn't very helpful though. The downside was the price I had to pay for parking.
I stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Seattle Tuesday through Saturday with my wife. The hotel is beautiful, trendy with very good service. It is just across from the convention center and has a Ruths Chris (that even serves breakfast), a Starbucks, NY-style deli, and Blue C Sushi attached. A Cheesecake factory is on the corner of the building but not attached to the Hyatt.The doorman, valets, bellman (especially Jazz), front desk and maids were all very good. We chose a club room which served a decent breakfast but seemed to skimp on the variety of food items for the evening appetizer drink session. The club room did have very nice computer stations, TVs, chairs and couches, and a fantastic view.The room was certainly large enough with a very comfortable king-size bed. What disappointed my wife and me was that the desk (i.e. the place to put your computer, cell phone, etc.) only had one available wall plug, hidden and inconveniently located behind the desk. Most hotel desks have lamps with electrical outlets in their bases, or several outlets purpose-built into the desk. Not so with our desk just a plain desk and one hidden plug. Also, only every third or fourth floor had an ice machine. When I needed ice (which was daily so my wife could ice her post-op foot) I had to go from the my 25th floor room to the 28th floor - or call for ice and wait.They also only provided two glasses for the room and no paper/plastic cups. We prefer to use two glasses for drinks and have two in the BR. When we would bring glasses down from the club to put on the bathroom counter, they were consistently gone in the morning. Moreover, the towels were remarkably thin and limp, not what youd expect from a high-end hotel and they only provided two hand towels and two not-so-large bath towels. (The towels at the Staybridge Inn and Hampton Inns where we also stayed on our trip were much larger and more plush and each gave us four of each.)We were surprised and disappointed that Hyatt would cut corners on the Club food, towels, and a decent computer desk. Otherwise, we had a nice stay and would consider staying there again.
The Hyatt Seattle was a wonderful choice for our conference. The staff was always willing to offer advice on local attractions and food, or just general questions answered with a smile every time. The room was so comfortable I slept better than I do at home and I didn't want to leave. Definitely will be my choice next time I visit Seattle.
This hotel is amazing! The rooms are spotless, beds are incredibly comfortable, staff is nice. The gym is incredible, with personal TVs on every machine and ice cold towels to cool off with. The location is great, with shopping every way you turn. While my husband was in business meetings, I kept myself busy roaming the stores in the area. It is an easy walk to Pike's Place Market, which is a must-see experience! So many awesome vendors with unique items to sell. It's the only place I have ever found something personalized with the correct spelling of my daughter's name. :) It was my first visit to Seattle, and I had a wonderful time. The hotel was perfect in every way. I would recommend to all.Thank you for your review. It sounds like you had a great time! It's wonderful that you were able to find all the great places to shop and visit while your husband was in meetings we always hope to accommodate all of our guests whether they are here for leisure or business or both! We hope to see you back again on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
Every stay at the Grand Hyatt in Seattle is memorable. They have every luxury well thought out and the location is in walking or taxi distance to all the best Seattle has to offer. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is very gracious.
This is a great hotel right where you want to be in Seattle close to everything transportation outlets malls very nice would recommend it to anyone clean safe I felt right at home and I will be back loved the service of the hotel
Stayed here for a week on a business trip, so got to know the hotel well. Very comfortable, well appointed with all you'd need (and expect) from a Grand Hyatt hotel. Convenient location in centre of downtown, close walking distance to office district, shopping, great selection of restaurants and 20 min walk from wonderful Pike Place Market. In-hotel restaurant is top end qualify, if slightly pricey, but good for breakfast. Service throughout the hotel is excellent, especially the guys out front who call you cabs.Tip for alternative breakfast option go to deli shop linked next door for great sausage muffins/ bagels coffee - delicious and served by lovely people.In summary, a great hotel from which to enjoy the city of Seattle!Thanks for your comments! It's wonderful that you felt happy and accommodated during your slightly longer stay our main goal is always to make sure that our guests feel valued and accommodated. We would love to have you back the next time your travels bring you to Seattle!Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
Decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt following our son's wedding for a day of R R. It was extremely nice with quiet surroundings, wonderful view and excellent service. Would HIGHLY recommend the location, the hotel and the brand
It is always a pleasure to stay at the Grand Hyatt nice rooms, great amenities and terrific staff. The consistency of the experience is also quite nice - no surprises, just a quality and peaceful stay. I recommend the Grand Hyatt to all travelers who want a home away from home experience and no hassles along the way.
Lost reservation, incompetence by staff,, overcharge credit cards.....that was my experience at the Grand Hyatt.After a long day of travelling to reach hotel and to be told issues with reservation, Front desk staff are either incompetent or lack required training for position. hotel sold out for the weekend. Asked to speak with someone with authority, asst. manager now involved. All I can say.... thank goodness reservation was booked thru an executive / director with the Hyatt chain.... Or we would of been screwed royally.Checkout was a disaster. Credit cards presented and staff unable to handle splitting the charges to two credit cards. Not only do they charge full amount to both cards, but do it twice. Trying to correct was a nightmare. Once back in Canada, numerous calls and numerous employees in Accounting involved. With the exchange on the CDN dollar, I'm still out of pocket for their error.Plus side, never again. Avoid this property. Other great properties in the vicinity that I'm sure offer better service!!!!!!To management, suggest additional training required for your front desk and accounting staff. Appears they have no clue in the process for checking in, customer service, or processing credit card payments and credits.
Had a great stay our room was very clean and very peaceful. It is in the heart of DT Seattle. We took the train to the hotel and it was pretty easy. We enjoyed walking all over downtown Seattle no need to rent a car. Major shopping and amazing restaurants right around the corner! We will stay here again!
I always feel like I am coming home when I return the the Grand Hyatt Seattle. Great staff and great hotel. It is a big hotel with the feel of a small boutique hotel that very much values my business. I am over 80 nights at Hyatt hotels YTD and this one of my favorites.
I am not always the big hotel person, they can seem bland to me. But the Hyatt was spectacular: We entered and we were greeted by Michael at the front desk on check in, who when he learned that it was our anniversary sent up some champagne and chocolates, the view from our room, the fabulous workout room (basically a nice gym with sauna and whirlpool), a beautiful bathroom and just a feeling of ease the whole time contributed to our relaxing visit. The workout space was heaven (and I usually hate working out but I enjoyed it here). You can also use the spa and workout space at the hyatt across the street which is even more extensive.We got free wifi too which is something you don't always get with business hotels. It is near the convention center which in some towns can be in a funky area of town. We were just a few blocks from Pike's Place Market, A good retail shopping district seemed to surround us and it was easy to get around.I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a more upscale stay.
I attended a conference for 4 days. The room was ideal for what I needed. The upgrade to a suite allowed for business to take place in my room without a bed in the middle. The bathroom was fantastic as noted by others. I enjoyed the fitness area, although a little confined relative to the size of the hotel and the fitness-minded Seattle population. The cab ride isn't bad and is under 50. I had colleagues that did the train for much less money and minimal trouble. Walking distance to great restaurants and the riverfront made the location very convenient.
Elegant and contemporary interiors without being gaudy. Attentive service. Close to downtown shopping, Convention Center, and business, Pike Place, and more and just a couple blocks from LightLink, too, from SeaTac! Club lounge is immaculate. Ruth's Chris offers restaurant and in-room dining for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Had high expectations upon booking through VISA Signature Hotels program, and was blown away.
Great location - close to shopping areas and tourist attractions.Great gym - nice facilities with sauna and steam room, but I wish they are open 24 hrs like the gym is.Friendly staff an easy check in process.Access to Starbucks, Ruths Chris, and deli mart from the hotel.
Hotel was great!! The rooms were nice and clean. The view of the convention center was a bummer, but the power shades were great. The staff answered all questions and heped with directions. Valet was outstanding!!! Only bad part was the tax on the room and 9.5 sales tax... Ouchie Mama!!
The location is excellent - it's within walkable distance to many attractions and restaurants we wanted to visit, and most of the others were just a short ride away. Room size is comfortable for a hotel in a city, its bathroom is quite spacious. The only thing about this hotel is the reception staff. We were checked in by a stone-faced male staff at the front desk, and checked out by a female staff who was not friendly at all. If I hadn't met other people in the city, I would leave Seatlle with an impression that people there are rude and cold. Thankfully everyone else I met there were friendlier than Grand Hyatt's front desk staff.Seattle has a lot to offer I'm sure I will come back here - but probably not to this hotel.
The bathroom (size,soaking tub, walking shower stall, robes) is in the same league as Bellagio but with a bit extra...complimentary toothpaste, cotton balls/q tips. Yes, they even have a coffee maker (which Bellagio doesn't offer). The same with both hotels, electronic sensor frig, move anything and it will appear on your bill. There's a Starbucks downstairs off the elevator. So convenient to the name brand shops and restaurants. It was enjoyable. Got complimentary wifi for our stay. The electric shade works very well. We requested a late checkout ( 1 hour) but wasn't granted one. There's a complimentary umbrella to use in the closet in case of rain. Safe in the closet.
My husband and I arrived a day early for our cruise to Alaska. I tried to find a centralized hotel where everything would be within walking distance of the hotel. We were greeted outside the hotel by very friendly hotel staff. The simple expression by the hotel staff to greet me by my name is well worth my visit. The hotel room was clean and very comfortable. The bell hop made it a point to go over everything in our room, give us his name and make a quick get away. The hotel was in a perfect place to walk Pikes Place, the Space Needle and all the shopping venues around the hotel. The martini bar around the corner offered some really good Bloody Mary's and buffet breakfast. Very impressed by the hotel.
Check in was quick, which is always a plus. The room I stayed in was clean and well appointed with a radical view of the city. Where they truly shined was the breakout sessions they put together during my conference. The food for said breakouts was tasty as well as thoughtfully and artistically displayed. One breakout had all food floating, on mini boats, around a moat the had made in the common area.
This hotel has what it takes to enjoy a Seattle exploration. It is surrounded by every area one must visit within a city that has so many facets to admire. The property has all of the amenities...a Starbucks, a steak house, a deli, a sushi bar, and a great fitness center to work them off. We walked everywhere with ease, and watched the world from a panoramic view from our picture frame window. To say that we were pleasantly surprised would, well, cover it....Thank you for your comments. We love that our central downtown location makes it easy for our guests to explore all that our great city has to offer. It's also great that we can offer all you might need without even leaving the hotel. We would love to have you back with us on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
We stayed at the Hyatt for a Christmas party. The room was everything you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. Updated, clean and comfortable. Check in was a nightmare. It took us at least 40 minutes. 3 people at the counter and only one of them was checking in anyone. We knew several of the people waiting in line. Two of them were sent to rooms that already had people in them. Then they had to come and wait in that 40 minute line again to get it straightened out. This sort of service is not what you would normally associate with a Grand Hyatt, especially with the rates they are charging. The Gold desk was not open and the concierge just sat there and did nothing to help either. The valet station was not operating smoothly either, both for check in and check out. All in all, the front of the house here needs some help.
We had a lovely Christmas staycation at the Grand Hyatt Seattle (seriously, we took the bus from our home in Redmond to get here).We were greeted with a hot chocolate and christmas cookie bar... as well as an upgrade to a water view room!The hotel is within walking distance to all of the main downtown sites. We ordered room service for breakfast and were happy with our waffles. There is a Starbucks right downstairs, so we got coffee from there and brought it back up for a Christmas Eve treat.The workout room was really high end and clean. There was also a sauna and hot tub - I wish I brought my swimsuit!The Grand Hyatt made our staycation overnight stay very special.
We were here recently for a business/pleasure trip. Business in that we did not pick the hotel but the meeting picked it. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is very nice, super convenient to everything, staff was outstanding and the room was clean and comfortable. While we usually prefer a smaller more boutique style hotel, this was absolutely a great alternative. Would definitely return to the meeting if it is held here next year. Free Wifi, water in rooms, lots of nice touches.
The location is fabulous. Walk to everything . Great gym at the property. Ruth Chris is attached and has two Happy Hours each day. Check it out! My one complaint was that housekeeping really did not do a good job. I kept asking for extra towels, turndown service, shampoo, coffee........ They just could not get it right. Asked for hangers, took three calls to get hangers. Other than that, the place was wonderful. Would stay there again.
Wonderful large rooms. Well kept. Walking distance to Seattle highlights and monorail and Link. I recommend this hotel if you need to be downtown or want to get by in city without a car. Service was top notch and I will stay here again.
Every aspect of my stay was wonderful. The staff was friendly, polite, professional, and genuinely caring towards their guests. Food provided at the conference was delicious and healthy with tons of options. The room was super clean, comfortable, and luxurious. Thank you for such an amazing stay at your hotel!! I hope to be back again soon!
You pay for the location but the hotel was fairly average as compared to Hyatt properties in other cities. The service was good but not particularly friendly. Staff were pretty aloof. The rooms were small but clean. Just didn't like the vibe. We will stay elsewhere on our next visit.
Excellent service from the staff. Great location. Extremely clean and classy hotel. Awesome hotel room with quite possibly the most beautiful hotel bathroom I've ever stayed in. Can't go wrong with this place. Awesome experience.Thank you for taking the time to review your guest stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle! We have such a beautiful property at a location that is close to so many attractions. Many guests love our spacious and luxurious bathrooms as well. We look forward to your return!Lindye W.Guest Relations Manager
7 blocks from downtown. Easy walking to many spots. Pike's Place, Original Starbuck's, space needle, underground etc. 15 floor view of the water. Ruth Chris restaurant inside hotel. Smaller gym, but all I needed. Staff was very helpful. Easy check in and checkout.
Very convenient location--took the Link in from SEA, and the stop was just a couple blocks away. Check in was quick and painless, and they gave me an upgrade per my Globalist (ugh, it pains me each time I type that) status to a corner suite. It was on the back side of the hotel (away from the Sound view), but it was a spacious room with the necessary accoutrements. The bed was comfortable, and the housekeeping staff was friendly. The club had a better spread than some other locations, and ample seating. Otherwise as far as restaurant outlets in the hotel, they had a Ruth's Chris (didn't go) and a deli/convenience store. There's a bunch of places within walking distance though, covering all types of cuisine, and it's very easy to get to the tourist attractions not too much of a jaunt to Safeco Field either.Would definitely recommend.
We stayed in a corner suite. I liked the setup of the suite which had a separate work area from the sleeping area. The bathroom was a good size as well. I also thought the cleaning staff did a decent job.What I didn't like: 1) the bathroom has some mildew issues in the shower that needs to be addressed and the tile grout throughout the bathroom needs to be cleaned/bleached as it is showing its wear and lack of cleaning. 2) on the last night of our stay I guess we finally got a next door neighbor and when I tell you the noise from them taking a shower was soooooooo loud... it was borderline unacceptable and really pissed me off. I had to turn the tv up to hear what I was watching. If we had heard that the 1st 2 nights of our stay I would have definitely complained but given it was our last night I left it alone but decided to post this review. 3) view of city was not that great. Our view was mainly of the top of some building and you could see a small part of the water Overall the hotel was ok but what really annoyed me was how loud our neighbors shower was while we were trying to turn in for the night. I don't know that I've ever stayed at a hotel where I could hear my neighbors shower that clearly (and I've stayed at a lot of hotels). This is Completely unacceptable!!!!!
Stayed for three nights at the Grand Hyatt over Labor Day Weekend. Originally booked on the 29th floor in a beautiful room. As stated in other reviews, the bathroom is almost as big as the bedroom... which is really great. Spent a lot of time in the tub!On the second day of our stay, the room next to us started sounding like a night club... around 4pm! After a quick peek, we realized it was a group of kids for Prom. Rather than deal with them later in the night we called downstairs and were moved immediately to the 26th floor. The room was slightly smaller, but definitely quiet! The staff was VERY helpful in our transition to rooms and the entire ordeal was over within a matter of minutes.The Grand Hyatt is very conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and the waterfront. We rented a car from Enterprise, which is only 4 or 5 blocks from the hotel. Seattle was wonderful and so is this hotel!
Very nice location. At the Grand Hyatt for a conference. Rooms great. Conference rooms great. Food for conference excellent, extremely fresh (nice crisp vegetables). All the natural finishes are lovely - fossils in the bathrooms. About as relaxing as a conference hotel can get.Thank you for the review on your stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We loved the feedback on the facility and food during your conference! I am glad you were comfortable during your stay, and we would be happy to welcome your conference back to our hotel in the future. Lindye W. Guest Relations Manager
Traveled to Seattle, WA for a business trip where I needed to be in close proximity to downtown Seattle. For the overall price/value ratio there is no better hotel brand in Seattle or nationwide. There is no reason to stay anywhere else nationwide when using the Hyatt Platinum Visa and being a Hyatt Gold Passport member.
The hotel is perfectly located downtown, near the fish market and other tourist attractions. It is next to the convention center, and a block from a major public transit hub (which connects to the airport as well as other areas.)The rooms are large, clean, and luxurious. The bathroom is larger than a double hotel room I stayed in in Denmark, and has a large soaking tub as well as a comfortable shower stall. The only oddity is that the sink seems to either produce warm water or cool water randomly, with little relationship to which tap I turn.The bed is comfortable, and the desk is spacious. There are power outlets in ask the places you'd want them. The wifi seems stable and reasonably fast.The staff have been helpful and pleasant. Check in was easy, and they have given me helpful advice getting around town.This is not a cheap hotel, but i am happy to be here.
This is a nice hotel. We checked in with Amber at the front desk, she was very friendly and helpful, even giving us a complimentary room upgrade. This hotel is located in the heart of the shopping district, with Nordstrom Store No1 a block away and Pacific Place across the street.The Good:Awesome Location for business and shopping.Nicely sized and updated roomsVery friendly staff and excellent service.The Bad: The four valet's, who were not busy didn't offer to help us with our bags while we unloaded from the taxi. The TV is a big, nice brand new HD LG flat LED. The signal strength to the tv is so weak that the screen was incredibly dim and hard to see. The hotel does not have HD service. I don't mean to sound petty, but on a weekend away from the kids it is nice for my wife and I to come back and relax and watch a game. I played with settings and could not get it fixed.Overall, I would happily stay here again. It is consistently a great value for such a nice hotel in a premium location. They staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and taken care of.
The location of the Grand Hyatt is in the downtown section of Seattle near the convention center.My husband could go to his meeting and I could explore the area.Could walk to the Seattle Art Museum ,which is not to be missed.The monorail is a short distance away and Pike Place Market is not that far.The room was very nice and the view was lovely.The shower was excellent and the room also had a large soaking tub.The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean.Staff friendly and excellent.I recommend this hotel.
We came off a week long cruise on a Friday morning and arrived at 9:30am expecting to have to check our luggage. Surprise - the gentleman at the front desk moved rooms around and checked us in! We were staying on my husband's business points for 4 days. Hyatt knows how to treat it's points customers right unlike that other big H chain where we find ourselves in the worst rooms they have. This was an 18th floor room with a view towards the space needle. We had a room with 2 full beds but it worked as our 21 year old daughter was with us. We did place a towel in front of the door one night as some hallway noise was coming under the door but it seemed to be related to all the Baseball Fans staying at the hotel and arriving back at once.The bathroom had great amenities, a soaking tub and a spotless glass shower. The safe in the closet accomodated the laptop computer and we had plenty of hangers. The dresser was a little small since it accomodates the mini-bar. Right after check in someone knocked and asked if we had everythng we needed and she was very friendly.The doormen were knowledgeable and gave us good directions and information on the area. The Starbucks just outside the lobby was slow as molasses but friendly just not efficient! The Grayline bus to the airport leaves at 15 to and 15 after the hour from the west side of the hotel. This was a very good location as we went to ACT theater one night, walked over and back to Pikes Place Market another and to the Seattle Art Museum. Several malls are also close by with Food Courts.
Grand Hyatt Seattle staff is highly trained and provide excellent service in all areas during your stay at the hotel. They are THE choice hotel to experience Seattle in comfort. All processes are made smooth and simple by their representative agents. Rooms are spacious and relaxing with great views of the waterfront. Grand Hyatt Seattle is also conveniently located next to an array of places to explore and they can provide car service for those trips outside of walking distance at flat rate fares.
My first time visiting the city, and I am so glad I chose this hotel. I was in town for a marathon the city was hosting. I arrived a few days early so that I could tour the city as well as rest a bit. As with any walking friendly city, location is so important. Trust me, It was centrally located. In one day, I walked to the CenturyLink Field event center for the expo, visited the market, the needle, and hopped aboard a ferry. Upon my return, I had the choice of a relaxing bath in a spacious tub or a quick shower. Definitely after the marathon, that tub came in handy!!! I was able to sleep comfortably every night which was very important for my mindset. Every evening I would return to a clean room with everything I had requested. Housekeeping was very attentive. Also, there's a Starbucks inside the hotel as well as a place that makes hot sandwiches which came in very handy for my last minute carb fix. If ever in Seattle again, I'm staying here!!Thank you for your comments. We're so happy that you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of all the amenities to prep and decompress from your marathon. It's wonderful that you were also able to explore the city and even get on the water while you were here! We would love to have you back with us during your next visit to Seattle.Best Regards,Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
Hotel has a nice lobby and check-in was nice and quick. Had a morning flight in and got to the hotel by 12 PM. They had my room ready and they were able to accommodate my request to be on the same floor as my brother's room. The room itself was just right for a family of four and the bathroom was a very nice size to accommodate the girl's toiletries and the boy's minimal essentials. Bathroom had tub separate from a nice size shower stall. As for the hotel location, only a block away from Pacific Place mall which had restaurants and a movie theater. The hotel was also only 7 blocks away from Pike Place Market which we practically went to every day. Very convenient to public transportation to and from airport as well as to the Space Needle. Definitely would stay in this hotel again if the opportunity arises.
Staying here puts you within walking distance to most of the places you might want to visit in downtown Seattle. It's cheaper to park yourself in the garage than to use valet parking. Check-in was quick and friendly. Our room was very nice and well-appointed. There is a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on site and other good restaurants close by and a Starbucks off the lobby. We would love to stay here again.
I used to stay at The W hotel in Seattle but now stay at this Hyatt. Beautiful rooms, great decor, some sides of the building do have a water view, great location, easy to walk down to the Pike Market, excellent shopping and sightseeing.My only compliant was the Asian gentleman working the front desk who refused to print my boarding passes after the printer on the self serve Boarding Pass Kiosk failed, I politely asked the other Gentleman working at the front desk and he immediately printed the boarding passes for us.Excellent Property for Business or TouristHighly Recommended
Good hotel. It was pretty, clean and super convenient to anyone using the convention center. Restaurants and coffee were just a quick walk away. Very pretty views of the bay! The staff was friendly. The elevators were quick, the parking was easy, and the lobby smelled very nice. All around a good business stay!
This is definitely one of our favorite hotels in downtown Seattle. The staff is what sets this hotel above others. The staff was courteous and friendly. The rooms are very clean and roomy. Located in the hotel is one of our favorite restaurants, Ruth Chris Steak House. Both are highly recommended for a weekend stay.
I liked the Grand Hyatt and may stay there again at my next visit to Seattle. Very convenient to go shopping, dining and taking bus/rail. Also, fitness equipment was clean and new which is important feature for my week long trip.
Everything in downtown Seattle was within walking distances. Otherwise public transportation e.g. monorail, light transit and buses were a stone throw away. Hotel was very comfortable and high quality and good value for the price.
I have stayed at several hotels in Seattle for work. This is by far one of the nicer ones and I would highly recommend it. The rooms are very nice and exceeded my expectations. The gym was also very nice.Thank you for your feedback! We're happy we can accomodate our guests needs while they are traveling with great service and amenities. Hope to see you again on your next trip to Seattle. Sarah S. Guest Relations Manager
My son was attending the PAX convention and has stayed at this hotel before. Great location for everything. Staff were overall great and helped us with a broken handle on our luggage. The only issue I have is why hotels in general only provide towels for two guests in a room that sleeps four We had asked for early booking, but the room was not ready. After a long flight I chose to wait in the lobby and it was awfully cold. My husband and son had left to attend a baseball game. When I got to the room after a two-hour wait, I then had to call down to get extra towels, as I knew there were not enough for all of us. We had a view of the space needle which was great. We were very pleased to find the mini-bar was empty and we could stock up the fridge with refreshments. At over 350.00/night with all the fees/taxes, it was pricey. There was a caf accessible from the hotel and we made a lot of use of it for a quick breakfast before heading out to see the sights. Overall it was really good, but expensive.
I am not Hyatt elite and I was reluctant to book this location. I opted for a suite and Kendal hooked me up with an amazing view for the week. Electronic blinds are nice, bathroom spacious, shower walk in. Beds are old - Marriott and Westin have better beds without question. Televisions stink (outdated and small). Exercise room is significantly better than average. I could not talk the front desk into experiencing the concierge lounge for less than 50. Not drinking, I could not justify that cost. Housekeeping was excellent, I requested turn down. I did learn to request sheet changed daily - 3 day sheet changes is too much for me. Bell desk was prompt, friendly. They offered to take my bags up at arrival and I accepted - missed a tip when they forgot about me. Location here is ideal, I walked to everything and cabbed easily in the rain.
hotel has good name but need up date for the guess room.bath tower need change to new one and Electric curtain is not working. shower head need change to new one. location is excellent and in the center of the city.
My wife and I stayed here for a night in February 2015 to meet up with family from England and we were very impressed with the rooms and service provided. The hotel is in an ideal downtown location which means that you can walk to all the nearby restaurants and attractions.
Fourth of July is a time to hit the road and with 90-100 degree temps in Chicago, I went West for the cooler air of Seattle. When I was hotel shopping I saw that the Grand Hyatt's rates were identical to many others in the area, so I decided to jump in with them. After I booked, it gave me an option to try to upgrade to a suite for 39, so, I said What the hell! and went for it.After, arriving in Seattle and taking the rail line to downtown, I emerged and walked 2 blocks to the Grand Hyatt. The lobby was quiet, intimate and spacious. Cassie welcomed me and began to check me in. She confirmed she upgraded me to the Emerald suite and told me I really gotten a good deal! I hope so, I though to my self. I ended up on the top floor with an amazing view of the sound, as well as much of downtown.The suite was awesome. It is hard to describe such an amazing room, with the view and all. It just sort of takes your breath away for a minute and you just soak it all in. None of the pictures here do this property justice. If you like what you see, you will be even more impressed when you are there. The suite did not even look like a hotel room, but rather some nice apartment I only wish I could afford. There were plenty of knick knacks, art, books, etc, all over. The Grand bed was - well, grand! You almost never want to get out of it. The linens were amazing, the bath stocked with every essential. Even a separate bath gel in case a bubble bath was in order (which it was one night). With more than enough room for two, several additional people could easily fit it with out any problems. Everything was neat, clean, comfortable, and housekeeping did an amazing job each day!The real gem of the hotel with Grand Club on 27. Although, not a lot of snacks, there were free sodas and juice all throughout the day. Tom, our host in the evening is the jewel holding the crown together! Beyond friendly, fun, and always on top of everything, he genuinely seemed to care! He remembered several guests drink choices from night to night (He certainly remembered mine, and I saw him acknowledge and recognize others). This level of personal attention is what sets this place apart from the rest.Watching the game on TV in the lounge, sipping a cocktail and munching on some cheese and veggies, I was quite happy. Tom seemed able to converse with kids and adults alike. Making his guests smile and happy seems to come naturally for him. Also a wealth of information on places to go, and the best way to get there, it was like having a live Google to chat with!The location of this hotel means that you really do not need a car. You can walk just about any where or a short cab ride at most. Save your money - forgo the car (and parking) and enjoy this city. There is a Starbucks and Deli in the lobby and several other Starbucks within a few blocks, so access to coffee and food are not a worry. Plenty of shopping and all the great attractions (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc) nearby!I would certainly stay here again - even if it cost a little bit more! Pamper yourself - relax and enjoy Seattle from the Grand Hyatt - it will be a a Grand Memory for sure!I appreciate you taking the time to give feedback on all the aspects of your stay with us at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. I am thrilled to hear that you chose us to spend your Fourth of July holiday with and that you were able to experience all that our hotel has to offer. Our suites are spacious and equipped with everything you need so I was glad to hear how comfortable you were. As well, I will certainly pass along the compliments to Cassie and Tom - they are truly a valuable part of our team. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel!Lindye W.

We had a long weekend stay here in June and the hotel was great. We found the location to be perfect for getting everywhere in the city easy walking to many locations and very central. The staff in every area were very friendly, especially in the Club Lounge. We enjoyed great breakfasts in the lounge, and there were very nice views over the city. Rooms were lovely, and beds always Hyatt comfy. Great sleep and no significant street noise to bother you during the night. We love Hyatt and would love to return here again!
Nice rooms and bathrooms. Comfortable and clean room. Nice staff and it was a very quiet hotel. I did not get to try the sushi restaurant in the lobby...next time. Great part of town, 10 minute walk to Pikes Place.
The hotel is great, the rooms have been updated. My TV came well appointed with a new LG LED TV that was probably 50 inches, a stand alone shower with a separate bath tube. The furniture and the room are well maintained, and the hotel itself has kept current with its decor. The hotel has a nice gym, pool, and all the other things that make a Grand Hyatt a Grand Hyatt. The valet was very quick with the car which is always fantastic. My only pet peeve is that there are a Starbucks and small shop attached to the property, but they do not take room charges. When you are connected to the hotel, in the hotel's actual building, you should take room charges.
Nice hotel and the room itself was also quite good. Very comfortable, good internet and not too dated.The lounge is a bit poor with very few places to sit down and do some work. There's a business center but like it didn't exist. Pathetic. But overall, the hotel is pretty good,The restaurant is fabulous and so is the breakfast, but at a high price though.Location is perfect, right at the heart of Seattle and very close to a shopping mall.
Nice bathrooms. Great view on higher floors. Appointed well. Bathroom was awesome. Beds were ok. Not the softest or comfiest we have slept on. Staff was helpful except for the 3 hour wait to get our room. They said they would call. Never did. We got an email not a call. Customer service could be improved.
The Grand Hyatt Seattle is a great place to stay when visiting Seattle. The light rail goes from the airport to west lake station, just 2 blocks from the hotel. Given Seattle's terrible highway traffic, having a hotel that can be easily reached for a fee of 3.00 on the light rail is a huge plus. The hotel is within easy walking distance of all of the tourist sites, museums, cruise ship and ferry docks, as well as many bars and restaurants. If you are planning on spending all of your time in downtown, you will not need a car if you stay here. If you decide to venture out of the city, there is a Hertz car rental office located in the hotel parking garage. The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The staff is very helpful and eager to make sure that your stay is stress free. If it happens to be raining, be sure to ask the front desk for an umbrella. They provide complementary sturdy and large umbrellas for guest use. We asked for a room with a view of the water. We had a room on the 25th floor that looked straight down Pine street to the famous Public Market sign. The view of Puget Sound was fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel.
We stayed here for six nights and absolutely loved this hotel. The rooms were quiet and very clean. Really large bed and huge bathroom. We actually extended our stay for another night we enjoyed being in Seattle so much. The hotel itself is ideally situated in the heart of town, just a short walk to Pikes Market and very close to shops and cinemas. We also found the staff very friendly and polite. We dined at the steakhouse and although we were not expecting it, it was fine dining and of course reasonably expensive, but definitely worth it. The steaks were divine! If I came back to Seattle again, I would definitely stay here. We loved it! The only small drawback that we didn't notice until one of our last days was that there was construction across the street. Luckily it didn't keep us awake. All in all I would definitely recommend staying here.
We were accommodated last minute on the same night that we arrived in Seattle for an emergency visit and it was a great choice in hotel due to the beautiful rooms and convenient location. The main complaint we had and reason why we'd also reconsider this hotel is the number of disruptions during the night. We were on the 27th floor this time and the stay before that, the 28th and the breakfast club had a toasted fire BOTH times! It was very inconvenient to woken up at 7am and have to run down 28 flights of stairs twice. It was a tough weekend due to the purpose of the visit and after a long day and night that was quite a disappointing situation.It would have been nice to be informed that it was taken care of, but we found that out after 20 minutes of waiting outside the hotel for 20-30 minutes each time thinking it was an emergency evacuation
Hotel felt very mellow, We hardly saw anyone in the hotel. Ruths Chris has a good happy hour,cheap drinks and apps .We checked in Saturday and were given a room on the 20th floor. Room was nice and modern. Bed was comfortable, roon had what we needed. Room rate of 143 and tax was 22 a day kind of nuts but oh well. This hotel is in a great locatio...close to everything Pikes Place Market, light rail station, monorail, bars with happy hour. Theight rail station to airport is only two blocks up. We also relaxed in the hot tub which was relaxing. Overall good stay , not crowded, great location, and nice rooms.
Great location and close to pretty much everything.What can you say really Room was great, spacious clean and well stocked, Bed was ultra comfortable and bathroom towels and amenities were all spot on. Only complaint could be that the T.V was very small compared to the standard of the room.Staff were great and always on point.I used the Hyatt Gym everyday and found it to be immaculate and never tooo busy.Only bummer was to pay for internet but at check out the lady asked if I wanted to join up to the Hyatt gold scheme and I did and then the internet was free but unless I had done that the internet was not free which considering the normal rate of the rooms is a little bit much in my opinion. On the subject of cost, I was on a discounted room rate but if I did take the going rate....all I can say is that if you want quality like this....expect to pay for it.Me and my girlfriend enjoyed and were comfortable every minute we were in the hotel.Thank you so much for your review. We're so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. Your comfort and happiness are our main priorities and it's wonderful that the amenities, location and features of the room made your stay a good one. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
Very close to everything I wanted to see. CenturyLink Field, safeCo, and public market. There is a ton of food options with a sushi bar starbucks, Ruth Chris and a Cheesecake Factory in the same building. If you need it there is also a hertz car rental in the same building. One thing I would want is a balcony. Bathroom has a shower and a tub.
We just stayed here our second time and it is officially our go to hotel when in Seattle. I expect friendly service, clean room, good location, etc., and I got it all at a high level. The rooms are well designed--large shower, comfortable sized space in room, mini fridge, good bed. All employees are very welcoming. The Club is also a great option.
40 minutes drive from airport, easy to get to, ample parking, Wifi, 20 minutes direct bus ride to downtown Seattle only 2 frequent bus service. Room very clean and huge, bed and pillows very comfy had a brilliant sleep every night. Breakfast excellent with loads to choose from. Only downfall no Pool. I would definitely stay here again when I come to Seattle. We're happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us during your time in Seattle. We do our best to meet all of our guest's needs, and the staff will be happy to hear they met all of your expectations.We hope that you will stay with us again during your future travels.Thanks so much,
Not realizing it would be Father's Day, and the golf tournament was going on, I was finding it difficult to book a decent and affordable room for this weekend. We were very pleased to find this place, perfectly located for the things we had planned in Seattle. The customer service was wonderful, the building was nice and clean and safe. Free breakfast and parking too. Only downside Other guests who can't be quiet. Some of us like to sleep past 5:30 am! I called the front desk to comment about it on the second morning, and I think they called the offenders, because it did quiet them down a little.Thank you for your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, and we hope to see you again the next time you're in the Seattle area!
Rooms are big. All the amenities from bottled water, single coffee maker and the pods, toiletries, good wifi, full cable, ironing board/iron, mini fridge , comfortable beds and very accommodating staff, it's hard not to give it a good rating. Considering construction on some floors were ongoing, the management has been good at communicating details on a daily basis the... More
My wife I stayed at this facility for just under 5 months. There was renovation work going on most of the time which was badly needed. There was an unusual amount of staff turnover at the front desk but Cassie was there the entire time and was always friendly. Eva of the kitchen staff was especially friendly and helpful.... More
Had a very good nights rest after long day of work. Spent 6 nights in the area working and it was nice to have a retreat away from home. The room had all the accommodations needed and the bed was comfortable. Had a Pizza joint down the road and Wal-Mart nearby with other shopping centers too. I enjoyed the breakfast... More
I called there asking to speak to my husband in the room in which he was staying. I gave the first and last name. I had failed to ask my husband for the room number...however due to the fact that I was not staying there and never been asked that before by any other hotel I was a little confused.... More
Very conveniently located near the airport and Ft. Bliss. Friendly staff, easy online check in. Excellent breakfast and happy hour. We loved the Texas shaped waffle maker. Suites are generously sized. Only wish the bathroom shower/tub fixtures and surround were updated.Thank you for your kind review. I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay at the Hampton Inn Suites El Paso Airport and will make sure to share your comments with our entire staff! Happy Holidays!
My family and I went to Nashville for a vacation which was almost ruined by the condition of the rooms at the Days Inn North hotel. We were there for a total of four nights, and on the second night, I was attacked by bed bugs. I received over thirty bites! The pain is unbearable and I would not wish... More
My family and I were visiting Nashville for a weekend getaway and we found the only thing we wanted to get away from was the room we stayed in. The advertised pictures and description of the rooms were very misleading. It smelled like a moldy basement and the bug falling from the curtain was an uninvited guest. The continental breakfast... More
The man at the front desk was fantastic, he let us check in a good couple hours early. The room was ready and clean. The beds were fantastic and soft! Perfect location not far from the downtown parts of Nashville. Easy access to and from the highway! I definitely will be staying here again!
Hotel is located about a 10-15 minute drive from downtown Nashville. Employees all were very nice. They are currently renovating and have construction going on. Did not have water (at all, no hot or cold, nothing) so not being able to take a shower after work is just unacceptable. Water was off for a few hours. Room was clean, but... More
This Best Western was really great! We had a room near the back of the property the first time we stayed here in April. Our balcony looked over the running river. The water sounds were loud enough to be a soothing help when falling asleep. It is close to all the action in town and a short drive to Great... More
Not what I expected our room felt like it was in a basement damp and humid so much so that the bathroom door didn't even close all the way Window air conditioner sounded like a freight train kept us up all night Free breakfast and laundry on site were nice
Room was nice. Friendly service.The location was within walking distance of the aquarium, Ripley's Believe It or Not, and shopping. Being put in Honeymoon Island was extremly awkward. So if traveling with friends, might want to be specific in which room(s) are acceptable.
This hotel and its people are always great. We always come back to this location even though there are many alternatives in the Greenville area. The location is perfect. From here there is no need for your car. You can walk everywhere easily.
Great place to stay. Great location. Many things to do and see in Greenville. Don't skip the west end of town, a lot to see on that side too. Avoid driving down main street, lot's of lights and too much traffic.
I gave this hotel 4 stars for staff and location. The staff were pleasant, very helpful and upbeat. It's a great location right in the center of many historical sights! It's walking distance to sights like Penn's Landing, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. The hotel is across from the US Mint, next to Ben Franklin's grave and near some good eateries like Sonny's and Happily Ever After. It also offers its own restaurant, bar and fitness center. Free wifi. It was a reasonable rate for the area. Parking was 36.75 for overnight but you can keep your car there the next day until 5pm. However you may be able to find a cheaper garage nearby. As far as the rooms themselves go- those I would rate a little lower. The room was a little on the small side and definitely could have been cleaner (like the bathroom and under the beds) but it was adequate and by no means did I feel like it was so dirty I wouldn't stay the night. Rooms are probably a 3 however. The room did have a coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator which was great! They are updating some different features so maybe this was part of it. Dear Trip Advisor Guest,Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and I would agree that we are in the perfect location to visit many of the historical sites in the area. It's a great part of town. Thank you again and we hope to see you back sometime in the near future. Regards,
Every time I stay here the Front Desk staff is terrific! A young man named Seamus was on duty tonight and he epitomizes the staff at this hotel. He was fast, friendly and efficient. He was also helpful with directions.The rooms are clean and nice. There is a great work area for my computer, and the chair is just right. There's a fridge and a flatscreen TV too.The dining area has a clean updated look, and the food is very good. Its expensive, but the convenience and good taste makes it worthwhile.This is a great hotel if you want to work in, or visit the historic district. Everything is within an easy walk.Dear Trip Advisor Guest,Thank you for your comments and great review. It's truly appreciated. Thanks again and have a Happy New Year. Regards,
The room was great. The only problem I had was that I called this hotel twice before I came to reserve a room under an employee discount once I got to the hotel the person I spoke to did not put my reservation in nor my name down so I had to pay 230 something bucks when I was suppose to pay 129 Im not sure if I would come back or not after talking to two people and neither did their job at all. Also the front desk agent ain't even try to ask me would i still like the employee discount added in which if I was a front desk agent I would still asked the guest if she still wanted to add the discount.Dear Trip Advisor Traveler, Thank you for the review. I was disappointed to hear of the challenges you experienced upon your arrival to the hotel. I hope that these challenges do not deter you from staying with Wyndham Hotels in the future. Again, thank you for your feedback. Kind Regards, Arvel H., Guest Services Manager
Clean, beautiful inside and out, nice size rooms, nice pool, breakfast was nice with plenty to choose from. beds very clean and comfortable. Quiet rooms and easy to get good night sleep. Very friendly staff.Dear Lisa, We are so pleased that you had a wonderful stay with us! Please let us know if we can ever do anything to make your stay even more comfortable. We look forward to seeing you again.
I was traveling to and from the Chicago area and we chose this motel because it was convenient to the highway and a good place to break our drive. The staff were very friendly and the rooms comfortable and clean. The full cooked breakfast was a big plus! We liked the motel enough to stop here again on our return... More
Typical Hampton Inn - but that is good! Consistent service, amenities, quality rooms. Hotel was clean, efficient front desk, good breakfast available. convenient exit from highway. good rates available.
The hotel looks good, and I don't know if things have gotten bad lately, but when we stayed there it was noisy as heck and the place is run by kids. We stayed AT FIRST (but not for long) on the first floor. Whatever was going on above us sounded like a wrestling match. It was there when we checked... More
We were staying here because it was close to Cedar Point. I have stayed at Hamptons often in the past, as I am an owner with Hilton Grand Vacations Club. Typically Hamptons are great. This one definitely was not, some maintenance issues with the room, and did not seem as nice as other Hamptons I've stayed in. The WiFi is... More
We are Hilton honors members and love the consistent accommodations, the staff was friendly. Our room was lovely, but due to a soccer tournament it was full of young boys who were running in the halls and kicking soccer balls. Not the hotels fault, but we were surprised at the noise level.
Second trip to this hotel and we won't stay anywhere else. Best hotel we have stayed at in a long time. The staff was excellent and did a great job recommending different resteraunts and other things to do while we waited for our hockey game.
This hotel looks amazing and the front desk staff is so kind! We set up a room for our guests during a wedding and everyone had such fabulous things to say- definitely recommend this hotel! Kecia is awesome to work with.
Place was clean and everything worked great. Bed was comfortable. Pool was very nice (there was areas to sit in the sun or shade). Breakfast was great (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, bagels/muffins). Parking right in front of your door.
We enjoyed that our room was on the first floor and our vehicle was parked right outside the door. Room was clean and the air conditioning was cold. We were in town for a family getaway and we enjoyed our stay.
Staff was friendly, helpful and efficient in providing directions and getting around the area. Breakfast area was clean and well-stocked. Beds were not too soft. Overall appearance was good and I would recommend this hotel.
amazing clean rooms at decent price.great variety of breakfast items and kept open until 10 by sam just for us.breakfast lady was very helpful. overall excellent staff running a nice clean place great for 1 night stay
Checked in around 12 pm in afternoon .the front desk allowed early check in.upgraded to king size suite .the big size room was amazing at 64.99 with sofa flat screen new single cup coffee maker.the bed was very comfortable and room was clean.morning again sam was there at breakfast.best breakfast buffet ever had with so many varieties
Unexpectedly needed a hotel near Harrisburg, Va. Stumbled upon the Quality Inn in Carlisle, on Harrisburg Pike, just 0.5 mile from I-81. Our room was spacious, well appointed and clean. The pool area (also well maintained and inviting) had music playing. But best of all was Debra, the registration clerk, who made us feel welsome, and went out of her... More
A snowstorm Feb. 15 forced me to abandon plans to drive from Ohio to CT in one shot so I got off the Pa. Turnpike at Carlisle and found a Quality Inn. I'm not a big fan of Quality Inns from past experience but I had no choice. But this one was good. My nose knows. If I smell cigarette... More
Clean the bathrooms. Noisy! After driving 10 hours, you wa, nna unwind call it a night. Don't do it there! Small plastic tiolet seat. Tub to dirty to put your feet in! I travel a lot. Stayed in quality inns. Just never this one again!
We tried this motel for the first time. Seemed convenient for us to stop there for the night. From this experience, I have learned to always ask to see the rooms before I lay down my credit card. the lobby looks nice...but that was it! As soon as you open the doors to the hotel halls, there was a musty,... More
Close to airport, clean, spartan, nice people, no negative experiences. 100 verse 175-200 options prior to Labor Day weekend. Was fine for what we needed. Coffee in the morning. Was only at hotel for 11 hours but would stay there again if needed.
We reserved a room with 2 queen beds. We were given room 1 (The Mayberry room) and were really excited based in the other reviews for the motel. The room does not have 2 queen beds it has 2 double beds. Room was small, bathroom was small. Shower only, no tub. No light in the closet, 3 plastic hangers. Window... More
We had high expectations due to all the great reviews, but we were slightly disappointed in our stay at Daisy Motel. The beds were VERY uncomfortable, so much so, that we didn't even stay the 3rd night we had planned to. We drove to Little Rock the 3rd night so that we could get some much needed sleep. The room...

This place is amazing! We were a little skeptical because of the fantastic price, but did it ever prove us wrong. There was a small snag in our room reservation, but it was taken care of immediately, and it actually ended up working out great for us. It is within a mile or two to Daisy State Park, which is... More
We had a wonderful stay at this hotel, the girl at the front desk at check in was wonderful! Our room was very nice with a great view of the city. Would stay here again, so close to little Italy, and the subway!I'm glad you enjoyed the effort my team puts forth to make sure your stay with us is great! Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Wyndham Garden Chinatown! We hope to see you soon!
We've stayed in better motels for a cheaper price, but we have no major complaints and slept well. Sure, it's a bit outdated and worn, but everything worked, no bugs and for the price you really can't get too picky.
If you're you're looking for a nice place to sleep after a long drive or if you're a local looking for some peace quiet this is the perfect place. It's right off the exit, surrounded by additional hotels, restaurants and a Tarjay (Target). I was over near Lenox mall and I drove 20 minutes away to this hotel because... More
The management of the property are nice enough people but they fall victim to some of the clientele that somehow cannot help themselves but to have police called on them. After the police left I heard yelling in the hall between a manager and people and it got extremely heated. I checked in at 8:30am and attempted to check out... More
Este hotel es un desastre, sucio, incomodo, poco estacionamiento, psima actitud del personal, lugar de desayuno insuficiente, en general un hotel espantoso, nunca volvera y jams recomendara.Amenidades nulas
This was my first visit to New Orleans and the first time I have ever stayed at a Drury Inn. The hospitality was great! Room was clean, the appliances and TV were in good working order. The beds were comfortable. I felt safe, Only guests were able to use the elevators with their key cards. The only complaint was the ice machine was near our room and it was making lots of noise. They were able to fix the problem the next day.The breakfast bar and appetizers were very good. Lots of variety and plenty to eat. If you are going with children or teenagers, it is very good on your food budget. The hotel was near the St Charles trolley line and Jackson Square. I was able to walk to the square early in the morning and just enjoy some people watching. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly.
Upon our arrival and during our stay the staff was the highlight. There was plenty of toilet paper, but the holder would not hold it up. The water was hot and pressure good, but the handle kept falling off. The bed was very comfortable and clean. It was in the morning we found unwelcome guest in our clothes.....very small ants!!!! We have only stayed at this Drury once and of course I cannot speak for the other rooms, but I will not stay there again. The staff was wonderful and our bill was adjusted very nicely, but the vermin bite! The hotel is in a great location to down town and the port if you are cruising.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your stay with us. Also, thank you for pointing out the items that were not working properly while you were here. As you experienced, we have no problem fixing things when we are made aware and making them right. One item that did not get fixed until you were gone was the sugar ants, but I want to let you know that too has been resolved the day you checked-out we had an exterminator come in and treat the room, and then revisit it a week later.I am sorry this was not a memorable trip for the right reasons, but I appreciate your kind words about the team. I hope to have the opportunity to serve you as a guest again.Sincerely,Patrick D.General Manager
Great location next to St. Charles street car and short walk to Quarter. Clean, quiet, spacious room. Always enjoy breakfast and Kickback. Attentive staff, warm pool. This was our first trip to NOLA but won't be our last, and we will surely stay at the Drury again.
Cannot say enough good about this hotel. Sometimes I pick obscure places to stay on vacation...but our 2 teens have declared that I have redeemed myself with this hotel pick! Everything here is new, fresh, modern, and clean. Huge rooms. Huge living area with sofa bed, desk, chairs, TV huge bedroom with 2 queens, TV, bench huge bathroom, etc. The absolute best part is the breakfast and dinner/cocktail hour. Breakfast is a real buffet with sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuits, waffles, pastries, etc. Even more surprising, the cocktail/snack hour really is a light dinner buffet. They have a salad bar, baked potato bar, a pasta dish, chicken strips, hot dogs, soup, nachos, chips/salsa, etc. We decided to just make a meal of it the night we arrived. Great for kids. You are able to get 3 drinks/person each evening: 4 kinds of wine, Bud Light on tap, margaritas, and several cocktails/mixed drinks. They also have coffee and a soda fountain. The lobby has a refreshment station with popcorn, a soda fountain, and 24/7 coffee. The hotel is a couple block walk to the SuperDome, and a reasonable 10 minute (safe) walk down Poydros to the riverfront, including the big Hilton, Harrah's, and the outlet mall. From there, it's a few blocks East to Jackson Sqaure/Cafe du Monde, etc. The cross street here becomes Bourbon St. When it crosses Canal St. (The official divider between the French Quarter and the CBD), so you're really right in the heart of the action in a 10 min walk that direction also. Great location all around! They valet park everything, but have a massive motor court where they can pull around 15+ cars at a time, so no problem there. We will definitely choose this hotel for our next visit to the Big Easy!
I have stayed at this Drury Inn every other year when I visit New Orleans during Mardi Gras Season. This year was no different... To make a long story short- Drury Inn charged me for two rooms but failed to let me know that upon arrival or checking in the hotel (I had apreviously called the hotel to cancel the reservation FYI). After I noticed the charge on my account I called and spoke with the manager Patrick to reverse the charges. He was super rude, loud talking over me, and had an I dont care attitude. He stated that he would fax in the necessary paperwork to my bank as they requested via email.( that was a Sunday) Monday went and still no funds-Tuesday came and still no funds. At this point my automatic withdrawals started to come out of the account. Which enabled my account to go in the negative and it set a domino effect. I checked in on Saturday and my bank froze my account due to suspicious fraud so I wasnt able to get any money off my account (but it didnt matter because Drury Inn had it all wrap up). Tuesday before I left I spoke with my bank and they told me they never received the proper paperwork so I went to the front desk and spoke with Jaime and she faxed the proper info over for me. Not even 30 minutes later my bank called me and said they received the paperwork and the funds are credited to my account. Now on to the housekeeping- our room had not been cleaned the entire time we were there- which was a Saturday through a Tuesday. Yes the trash was emptied and the beds covers had been pulled over( which I had an issue with because the first day the sheets I had had urine stains on them) after I returned back to the room I asked if someone could come change my sheets. When I returned I asked the front desk if it was taken care of and they stated yes (what they didnt know is that I put a quarter in the middle of the bed under the covers). When I came to the room it was still there. The entire I was there no one vacuum the floor and I had to call everyday to ask for towels - the minimum required towels was not left in my room after cleaning it. I had a few questions and concerns for the manager Patrickbut he blew me off, loud talking me, his exact words were you did this so deal with it. Tuesday morning I attempt email to contact the manager Slade about the situation just to let him know that my bank stated they never received the authorization to reverse funds but he never called me back and I called him at 8:22 am. Yes I went down to the front desk and Jaime took care of it but he was avoiding me because he did not want to handle the situation. His exact words were you would have to call Patrick because he knows the situation and I dont have anything to do with it since he already knows the story. The crazy thing is I actually love this hotel but I wont ever be staying here again when I come to New Orleans. Talk about unprofessional and unable to handle a situation! By the way if I could give a negative 22 on the score I would. All weekend I was suppose to be enjoying the festivities for my birthday but I had to continuously run up behind Drury Inn for answers. What if I didnt have any cash on me how was I going to be able to get back home Im so disgusted by it ALL.
This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! Check-in was a breeze and had no problems getting to our room. The lobby displayed a classic 1920s hotel style, as well as a grand staircase. The hotel's elevators are room key activated only, for safety reasons. We had a smoking corner room on the ninth floor and there was no trace of smoke anywhere in the room. There was clean white sheets on the bed and clean carpets. Also to our surprise, there was a door that led out to a balcony (we was one of the two rooms to have this.), which I enjoyed being a outdoors person. The bathroom was clean and spotless. The shower provided shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, although I brought my own. The 5:30 Kickback in the lobby was like dinner to us. There was hot dogs, chicken tenders, cocktails, and liquor (2 for every person and show your room key). The pool and hot tub were clean and pristine, although I didn't use it. The views from the rooftop were breathtaking. The fitness room had a bike and step machines and two treadmills (a somewhat small room, though). The general manager and his staff were great to us. I will recommend this Drury Hotel and will stay here again when I come back to NOLA.
We just returned from a three night stay at this hotel. We loved it. Public transportation is right out the front door (bus and streetcar). If you'd rather walk, just head strait down Carondelet - it turns into Bourbon when you cross Canal (6 blocks).Hot breakfast is provided every morning in the lobby. On Sun-Thur, each adult guest receives three complimentary evening cocktails in the lobby.The rooftop pool is small, as is the fitness center.The lobby is beautiful, with marble floors and nice chandeliers. We stayed in a king suite, and it had tons of space, although the bathroom area seemed small. Our teenaged nephew slept on the pull-out sofa, and appreciated all the room he had to spread out. He also appreciated that we had our own tv in the bedroom, so he could have control over the one in the living room. He loved the free internet access, but didn't love the TONS of pop-up ads that came along with it.The king suite had:One bedroom with king bed, two night stands with lamps, entertainment center with television, telephone, and closet. Living area with pull-out sofa, chair, recliner, coffee table, entertainment center with television, refrigerator, and microwave (2 free soft drinks and microwave popcorn provided), and desk area with internet access.The vanity area had another closet, as well as a coffee maker. Parking is 13 a day, which is a bargain. The lot is self-park, no valet, so you have access to your car whenever you need it.Make sure your room key is always handy. You need it to get in and out of the parking area, to use the elevators, and to get into the back entrance (all day) or the lobby entrance (after hours).This was our third trip to New Orleans, and our first stay at the Drury. I think we'll stay here again.
Hotel is great and will stay here again! Located in the business district.Cab ride from airport for 3people is a flat 15pp. 2 people is 36.Day manager Kyle was fantastic and always made time to ask about our day.All staff was friendly and very nice.Free breakfast was very plentiful and decent choices.Evening free buffet was also plentiful plus you get 3 free drinks!Pool was nice and hot tub was large. 2 washers and dryers near the pool area.Beds were very comfortable and rooms were a good size.We had 2 queen beds, desk with business chair and a sitting chair.Our room also had a mini fridge and small microwave.Elevators will only work with a room key so that was nice for security.Located about 4blocks from French quarter it is a straight walk to bourbon street.St. Charles trolly stop just across the street that heads towards the French quarter so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.Cab ride back from French quarter was anywhere from 5 to 10My only drawback would be our room did not have a safe but other than that had no issues whatsoever and will look to stay in a Drury Inn again if it's in a city we are traveling to.
This location, like all Drury locations, exceeds all expectations for a lower cost, quality hotel. If Drury has a location in the city I am traveling to, I know where I will stay!Rooftop pool was very nice, rooms (2) were quiet and clean, service exceptional as always. We were in New Orleans for two nights after a cruise. Close to all attractions (walking distance to Bourbon street) and on the Trolly Line. If we return to NOLA, we will come back to Drury.
Perfect home base for our week in New Orleans. Very centrally located and reasonably priced. Valet service was excellent. Room was clean and the staff was all nice and helpful. I would strongly recommend this hotel for families staying in the city.
We come to New Orleans multiple times a year. We normally stay at another chain of hotels but our normal arrangements were booked full. This is our first time at this particular hotel and staying with this chain. The positives are this hotel is nice, very updated, we found our 2 bedroom suite to be very spacious, very clean, and the offerings for the food choices of the happy hour and breakfast exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful. They even assisted me to book needed activities for our family. The negatives are this establishment is ran so tightly it is at the expense of the comfort of its customers. The happy hour requires you to keep up with a card per adult to ensure you receive no more than 3 beverages. The happy hour offerings are of course well drinks and cheap wine. My husband accidentally spilled his last glass of wine at the bar and the employee made mention he was exceeding the allowable amount of beverage as he begrudgingly replaced it. The air conditioner is fixed to not go below 70 F. Our entire family was extremely uncomfortable and sweated all night. The tubs are fixed to only allow showers. There are not individual toiletries. Instead there is a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser attached to the wall. It kind of grossed me out to think every other naked person before had touched it during their shower. They do advertise to earn so many reward points for everyday you do not utilize housekeeping so that leads me to believe this is a brand/chain initiative. It's a nice hotel that is uncomfortable and that's just unfortunate. My husband's review was, It's like being a guest of a cheapskate.
Comfortable rooms, although those on the street side pick up traffic noise. Located a block from both trolley lines to WW2 Museum and French Quarter. But only a few minute walk to either one. Staff was friendly and efficient. Pool and hot tub.Good free breakfast items, including waffles, eggs, sausage, etc.The eveningfree buffet features hot dogs, baked potatoes, soups, salads - plus three free alcoholic drinks per person.
Very nice hotel in a pretty good neighborhood. Close to trolley stop. Easy walking distance to riverfront, a little farther to Bourbon St. We were pretty low when we stayed and one night was VERY noisy outside. Ask for a higher room. The staff was very pleasant and competent and the facility was very clean. The breakfast buffet was pretty good (considering the price) and the dining room was 4x bigger than you would typically see in a free breakfast area. The afternoon Happy Hour was always fun. We saw a lot of New Orleans from there, with the exception of the Garden District. Very good stay and I would go back there on my next visit to NOLA. The rates were fairly good, but the parking seemed excessive.
Stayed in the Drury Inn and Suite for 2 nights over memorial day weekend and it was the best hotel i've stayed in for a long time. Our suite was huge with a large lounge, bathroom and huge floor to ceiling arced window which over looked the pool.The reception staff were always friendly and ready to help with suggestions of places to eat and really added a little extra to the stay. We were also allowed to check in at 11am without any additional cost which was really appreciated.The happy hour had a huge range and gave us the energy we needed after a day of walking NOLA's famous streets before heading out for dinner. Breakfast was also very good, with lots on offer and staff were always available to top up anything running empty.The location is great - with a street car stop right outside, altho we walked to and from the hotel to the french quartered repeatedly as it was a nice walk and only a few blocks.The rooftop pool and hot tub were perfect and always clean - the only problem was they only open them at 9am!Have only good things to say of this hotel - would book again in a second and would recommend to anyone visiting NOLA - it's a fantastic place!
My husband and I stayed here for three nights last weekend and loved it from the moment we walked into the lobby. We arrived prior to check in time and we were told our room would be ready in about an hour. The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful and offered to store our bags while we went to lunch. They gave us several recommendations for restaurants nearby. The hotel is very elegant and so immaculate! Location is wonderful...close to the french quarter but in a quiet, safe area. The breakfast buffet was great and the evening happy hour and buffet was excellent too and a great added bonus. You can't beat the value of this hotel.
Our family of 3 stayed here for 4 nights in late December. The whole experience from arrival to departure was enjoyable. We arrived at the hotel before lunchtime, and were pleasantly surprised to be able to go straight up to our room. The young woman who checked us in (Jamie) was so welcoming and friendly, we felt at home instantly. She even gave us a great recommendation for lunch, which we took, and enjoyed. Our room was on the 6th floor. It was large and well set out. We had 2 comfortable double beds , an armchair, desk, large screen TV, fridge, coffee maker and toiletries. The included breakfast was plentiful. Not a huge choice, but we always found something we enjoyed. It was busy during our stay so some mornings it was hard to find anywhere to sit, but one thing I will mention is the manager(s) were always making sure tables were cleaned briskly, so the wait was never too long. I found seeing management level doing this task and mingling with the people staying at the hotel a really nice touch. They always made time to ask about your day, and seemed to genuinely be interested in what you had to say. The nightly 'kickback' was another nice touch. We usually just had a nibble on the chips or popcorn,as had already eaten enough during the day, but it was fun to meet fellow holiday makers and hear about where they were from, or ideas of what to do around New Orleans. All in all I can not fault this hotel at all. Well done Drury Inn New Orleans for a efficiently run hotel with welcoming and friendly staff. Keep up the great work.
The Drury Inn and Suites in the Central Business District, New Orleans is close to everything, a few minutes walk you are in the French Quarter or at the Superdome. Surrounded by restaurants and bars it makes it convenient for short or long term stays. The staff makes you feel right at home from the minute you walk in and the evening social is a great time to meet new people while enjoying the free perks the hotel offers.
This hotel is well located with an easy walk (15 minutes) to the French Quarter and on the trolley line. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Service personnel are very gracious and helpful. Small coin laundry on the second level. Hot breakfast and snacks in the afternoon as well as popcorn and pop available in the lobby until 10pm. The only caveat is that the street side rooms are quite noisy as the trolley line passes on the street outside and seemed to run all night.
We arrived on motorcycles just at the start of a rain storm. They let us stay under the awning till it stopped. Staff was friendly and courteous as always! Very elegant appointments in the rooms and lobby. Can't say enough about the breakfast, dinner and drinks.
We stayed one night and were pleased. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. Not only was a full, hot breakfast included but happy hour offered hotdogs, tacos, baked potatoes, soup and 3 free cocktails per person. Nothing fancy but everything you need.
We could not have chosen a better location for quiet, access to street cars, and value! Highly recommend the Drury Inn NOLA. Friendly staff too and parking fees were not outrageous compared to other hotels in the city.
Absolutely loved this hotel. Located in a quiet area 5 blocks west of Canal and Bourbon streets. Free all you can eat hot breakfast in the morning. Hors d'oeuvres served in the evening along with 3 free alcoholic drinks per person. However, if you do this, you lose the chance to sample all the great New Orleans restaurants. g But, if you are on a tight budget, this really helps to defray expenses.Trolley line is just across the street from the front door and it will get you to just about everywhere in the area.King size bed was comfortable with 5 pillows provided. Our room had a whirlpool bath. Front desk clerks are so pleasant and always smiling considering they seem to spend most of their time answering tourist questions. My thanks to Renaldo, Ayila and Star. I will definitely stay at this hotel next time I return. And I had so much fun in this city, I expect to return soon.OldTOm
This trip was just a one night stay for a concert with just my daughter and myself. We arrived around 4:30 in the afternoon. Check in was quick and the clerk was extremely friendly and helpful. I requested the highest floor and away from street traffic and both were granted. The hotel is really nice inside and was spotless. Our room was a double and it was extremely clean and roomy. The bathroom was really nice and the beds were comfortable. We had adequate towels for the two of us. Another plus for this hotel is the secured parking lot is adjacent to the building. I really don't think there was anything that I would say needed improvement there. Customer service was great throughout the stay. You have to use your roomkey to access the hotel after 10:00 PM. You also have to use the key to operate the elevators from the lobby and to open and close the gate so be sure to keep one of your room keys when you check out if you are driving or you will have to go back inside as I did to get a key to get your car out. The hotel is walking distance to Bourbon St and the Riverwalk area (In my opinion). It may be a little far if you have any mobility issues. It is only a 4 or 5 block walk to the Superdome or the New Orleans Arena. We will be staying here again in the future.
We stayed in a 2room suite for 3 nights in April. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are so sound proof that we slept great. The bathroom are beautifully updated with a tub and walkin shower. A plus is the hot breakfast included in the ratted and the 5:30-7:00pm kick back with free drinks and apps. Easy walk to the French quarter and there is a trolley stop right in front of hotel.
You will save money on food when you stay at Drury in New Orleans! The room, facilities, and pool were immaculatly clean and fresh. And the staff were all knowledgeable, caring, and friendly. We loved it!!
My family of 4 stayed here for one night in New Orleans. We were looking for a nice place that was near major tourist attractions and didn't cost a lot - as we were just passing through on the way to our vacation. This Drury worked out nicely.It was easy to find from I-10 - near the SuperDome and close enough to French Quarter that we could walk - even in the heat of July. Having said that, I did have the impression that it was closer. We walked to Canal St and the Riverwalk - several blocks and then worked our way back through a couple of FQ streets to find a spot for dinner. It was a LOT of walking. After dinner, we caught a cab (for less than 10) back to the hotel. We spent the evening in the rooftop pool. It was fairly small, but adequate. Our room had beautiful tall windows and ceilings, making quite a first impression. The beds were comfortable. The parking lot side of the building was rather loud because of the frequent passing by of the streetcar (this streetcar went to the Garden District, I think). Parking was 15 - a bargain compared to most of the hotels I looked at, and it was self park. You needed your room key to get in/out of the lot, but could come and go as you please. Much easier than valet, in my opinion.Breakfast was nothing special. We found the area crowded and the selection very limited. We ate a small bite and stopped at Cafe du Monde for beignets later in the morning. We would stay here again under the same circumstances, but if you are planning a longer stay or want a hotel with more of a NO feel, Le Pavillion is right across the street and is beautiful. Hotel Monteleone was a little closer to things and was the most beautiful hotel I saw. We paid an internet price of approx 80 (+tax) and 15 for parking.
Nice clean and I was impressed with the hot food served (BREAKFAST Dinner) plus three free mixed drinks for the guests..Safe feeling coming and going....Highly recommended.....I will be back again!
For starters its america, so home of customer service. The heating was broken in our room and they immediately switched us rooms and upgraded us to a suite for the same cost. Its a great location close to everything. They offer a great breakfast buffet and a later afternoon buffet of snack and also alcoholic drinks all for free. The location is quiet besides the tram, you can hear it very clearly. we enjoyed our stay very much
This Drury Inn is in the perfect location in New Orleans! Only blocks away from Bourbon St. Right by the parade routes for Mardi Gras, and even the superdome. The free breakfast, and 5:30 kickbacks just add to how great this hotel is. They just provide such a great deal with the atmosphere of the hotel, to the staff. Whenever I travel I try to only book a Drury Inn Suites hotel.
Thus place is awesome! We went to New Orleans for Christmas just to visit and the staff were super friendly, the hotel was very clean, the room was spacious, the bed was super comfy (and for me to say that is amazing) and the Kick Back is a great deal as well. What more can you ask for than free drinks (3 per person per evening) and free food that could be your dinner if you aren't planning on visiting a restaurant. Everything about this stay was great. When I come back, and I will, I plan to stay with you guys again. I know the hotel industry is tough and no one likes working Christmas anyhow, but everyone had a smile on their faces the whole time. No Grinches!
Room bathroom were very clean.. Beds very comfy! My room facing the busy Poydras street. Noise wasn't so bad at nite I did sleep soundly but awoken pretty early by street noise..suggest room not facing the street.. There is a happy hour I missed unfortunately as I believe the hours were 5-7pm .. I did make it for popcorn sodas which was great we arrived pretty late.. Distance It is about 2-3 blocks to French quarters .. It really is not far but when your tired and it's 1 am it's far ! Area is safe.. Hotel locks up doors elevator at nite must use room key to get in which I liked felt a little more secure. Hotel folks all very friendly helpful. There is fridge, microwave , small mini hairdryer (not attached to wall) all very handy . Breakfast was ok did the job. Parking pricy 25 plus 3 parking tax! but guess that's pretty standard parking price for French quarters ..
An overall excellent experience. The hotel staff was consistently friendly. Well situated to the French Quarter, Riverwalk, Harrah's and much more. The complimentary breakfast had a lot to offer - fresh fruit, waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage patties, yogurt were only some of the items available. There's also a complimentary happy hour with food, but we were out about. The rooms were nice - the beds suited us, there was a small refrig the shower was OK. An appreciated detail was that there are an abundant number of outlets throughout the room. If driving, it's not too far off the I-10 hotel parking is valet only.
We stayed in the Drury Inn over the fourth of July. We checked in early and were given a great room. Huge, immaculate and on a high floor. The included buffet breakfast and nightly kickback hour were amazing. Could not believe the assortment of items and generous cocktails too. Additionally, soft drinks and popcorn available daily in Lobby. The pool and hot tub were refreshing after hours of sightseeing. The Manager Patrick Dettweiler was wonderful. A fountain of knowledge and ever-present. We would highly recommend Drury to anyone visiting NOLA. Thanks again.
Clean and comfortable. We missed the complimentary drinks and snacks but They drinks and popcorn for us at check in. Pool and hot tub located on roof which was neat. We did have to pay to park 40 which we thought was unnecessary. I think they should include it in the price and those that want valet could have that available. It was hectic trying to leave bc there was only one the valet man and not room to unload and load up. I would have given this hotel a 5 star but we didn't like the parking situation.
This is our second year that we have stayed some nights in this downtown location. For a tour coach that comes in with 50 people, having three elevators is a huge bonus. Located within reasonable walking distance to many businesses, tourist attractions, and about a 20 minute easy walk to the French Quarter. The new addition to this complex will certainly enhance the appeal once it opens later on this year.
My husband and I stayed here 3 nights in May 2011 after a cruise. The staff was friendly and helpful, and our room was comfortable, spacious and clean. The building has old-style class and charm. When we reserved we requested a small refrigerator with a freezer unit (to re-freeze cooler pack for my husband's insulin) it was present when we arrived, but not freezing properly -- it was fixed promptly and worked fine the rest of our stay. The breakfast buffet was much nicer than average and includes do-it-yourself waffles. (Make sure to get to the breakfast within the stated hours -- they are serious about shutting down on time.) The free drink and snack time each evening was a nice perk, though we were only present for it once -- too many other things to do in the area! The rooftop pool and hot tub looked great, but the weather was a little too cool to make use of them while we were there -- go up for the area view even if you don't want to have a soak.
My husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend before Mardi Gras. I was a bit apprehensive because of some reviews but overall I was pleased. The staff was very nice and helpful. We left our room early in the morning and several days near noon and upon our return our room was nice and tidy. We had a jacuzzi suite and it was quite spacious...enough room for much more than two people. There are two full size closets, mini fridge, flat panel TV, livingroom, and separate bedroom. The short walk to the French Quarter was nice and there is a Domino's just around the corner for an evening snack...or there are many nicer places that deliver to the hotel. Maybe the only little thing that kind of bothered us was the view. I am not sure if all jacuzzie suites are situated in the back corner of the hotel but our view was faced west and consisted primarily of two brick walls bordering the parking lot and some buildings off in the distance. Since we didn't spend much time in our room, the view did not bother us much. It was our first trip to New Orleans for some of the Mardi Gras festivities and we look forward to staying here again in the future.
My husband and I stayed here during Jazz Fest in early May. The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside- it appears to be an older building. We had a king room on the 7th floor- the view was of a parking lot with graffiti on the walls. The room was perfectly adequate though- the bed was comfy, shower pressure good, and we didn't hear any noise from outside or within the hotel. Nice and quiet- we slept great. The 5:30 kickback was great! Free drinks and appetizers. I just wish it lasted more than an hour since we didn't make it back to the hotel in time each night for it. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful as well. Waffle maker, hot buffet items, juices, etc. And included in the cost of the hotel room- a great plus. The hotel was a short walk from French quarter and other areas of interest. The city bus ran close by to the hotel- we took this to the City Park and rode bikes, as well as to the Jazz Fest. The price for our room was pretty steep since it was during Jazz Fest- but we still felt like it was a good value and in line with other hotels in the area. Parking was 25 a night plus tax. The hotel is still undergoing renovations- it looks like the parking garage will be attached to the building rather than 10 minutes away which will be nice. Overall would recommend staying here- no reservations!
My family of 5 stayed here for two nights. Best deal for a solid hotel close to the quarter with tons of room. We had two queens in the bedroom and a pull out couch in the sitting area. So. Much. Space! Clean, quiet, and a really great little pool.
A couple of friends and I went to the NKOTB concert and stayed at the Drury. It was a very nice hotel, helpful pleasant staff, spacious rooms, and we LOVED the free drinks, and kickback! We stayed out to late and so we missed breakfast, but everything else was very nice! We did have a small complaint that our room smelled like smoke it didn't really bother us that much, but we didn't want to get charged for smoking in the room when we didn't, so we reported it. The guy at the front desk said he would have someone right up to deodorize it and credited us for our parking fee for the inconvenience. That was SO nice! By the time we got back to the room, we couldn't smell the smoke anymore and it was a fresh scent in the room. I will stay here again!
We had taken a road trip to Texas, and decided on our return drive to stay 3 nights in New Orleans, as I'd never visited this city. We definitely recommend Drury Inn Suites, located in the business district. Its close to everything the trolley tour buses have the Drury as one of its stops. Our king suite was all that we wanted more! The bed was comfortable roomy bathroom was a welcome sight. Also enjoyed the morning's hot breakfast the evening food with beverages. Staff was quite friendly, accommodating friendly. We'll definitely stay here again!
This is a lovely hotel....part of hotel and lobby is remodeled from an older elegant billing. They kept the character of the old But updated to modern very nicely. We love the concept of the kickback and not having to get out and find a place for dinner when youre already tired from sightseeing. Kickback always has enough different items to satisfy the hungry in most people. Breakfast was very good and plentiful.We are sorry there are no Drury facilities in the northeast..we have never been disappointed in a stay at Drury.
We arrived at this hotel at 11am and our room 709 was ready. No noise comfortable room. The roof top pool was OK temperature for a night swim, even though it was cold outside. Jacuzzi was hot. Small exercize room. On major bus lines but it was quicker to walk to French Quarter and Riverwalk. The breakfast and afternoon kickback were good. Three well drinks p/p at happy hour made me happy. The entire hotel was very clean, well maintained and in a safe neighborhood. And by the way, we took the public bus from the airport for 2. It is called Jefferson transit,leaves every half hour, you can take two pieces of luggage, it took 1/2 hour to arrive three blocks from the hotel.
Drury Inn and Suites in New Orleans was a wonderful choice for our extended stay after a conference. The location is very convenient to all of the sights. The streetcar stop is right on the corner. Our room was huge, clean and comfortable. We did not have a great view from our window but most of the time we were out and about. The price of the hotel was just right. The breakfast was free and plentiful. The best part about Drury Inn was the Kickback hours--free hot food and drinks! Every staff member we encountered was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate their guests. The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful. We will definitely stay at the Drury Inn and Suites the next time we visit New Orleans.
My wife and I have stayed at the Drury Inn New Orleans several times in the past and find the location, service, cleanliness and value to far exceed the competition. The staff and facilities are top notch. We booked two king suites for six guests pre-cruise and loved our rooms. However, until the valet area is complete, we may have to look elsewhere. We were trying to assist our elderly parents, our two children, and lots of luggage and feel the unloading area being used is very unsafe during peak times. There just isn't enough room to handle the volume of traffic. This was a very stressful situation before we even checked in. I am still rating our stay with 5 stars because the staff deserves it. Management needs to address the off street unloading problem!
he hotel was great it had a rooftop pool and a gym the rooms were great d clean very nice staff near all the actiton in new orleans the hotel was great breakfast and dinner was wonderful i loved the waffles
This hotel is conveniently situated near the Riverwalk Convention area as well as the Bourbon Street area. I walked from my hotel to both of these locations for a week. This hotel is clean, nostalgic, and accommodating. We received free drink cards upon check-in for drinks in the lobby from 530P to 7P. Although there are no restaurants in this hotel, they can get delivery of almost anything you can think of as far as food. The first night I was there, I was leary of walking to a nearby restaurant or Bourbon Street, but there was no need to be. This hotel is growing and has a brand new wing that will open in about 6-12 months. The construction commenced M-F starting at 7A, but no contruction on the weekends! I believe the cost was very good for the accommodations and service.
This hotel has the friendliest staff around. The hotel is very clean and they provide a hot breakfast and an evening dinner with drinks. Also popcorn and soda. The pool and hot tub are terrific and offer a nice view of the city. The hotel is located directly across from the stop 8 on the hop-on-off bus tour and next to public transit. Can't go wrong with this hotel.
What a wonderful hotel we could not of ask for a better hotel staff during our stay. 'Great breakfast in morning and nice drinks and food in the evening for a little something before you go drinking on Bourbon Street. Has wonderful pool and hot tub and exercise room.
We stayed at this hotel for 3 days prior to taking a cruise.This hotel is in a great location-within walking distance of the French Quarter and the Riverwalk.Our room was large and very clean. The furniture was up-to date. The beds were comfortable. The free breakfast buffet in the morning was wonderful...everything you need to start the day off right and the free supper buffet in the evening was equally delicious, including 3 alcoholic beverages per person. The rooftop pool and hot tub area with lounging chairs etc. was also very clean. The staff were also very friendly and polite. From check-in to checkout all the employees were great. Any request was responded to immediately. A special thank you to Renaldo for all his help in trying to locate a missing bag for us.This hotel is a gem...we would stay here again if we are ever back in New Orleans and would recommend this hotel to all...you won't be disappointed.
This was my second stay in this hotel. The first was before Hurricane Katrina and the 2nd was after in 2010. We remembered having a very nice stay there before so decided to try this hotel again. The location is wonderful...right next to the trolley line (but not a noice issue...very quite). The price is very reasonable. We checked around...an excellent value in my opinion. We got a 2 room King Suite for the 3 of us. We loved everything about this room. The ceilings and windows are old-style tall...which just feels right in this city. There is lots of granite everywhere. The living room is a completely separate room so everyone had their privacy. The king bed was very comfortable. My 17 year old son said the fold out couch was pretty nice too....although he wouldn't want to share it with anyone...then again, he's 6'4 and about 210 lbs.! The breakfast was a very nice buffet, hot, and plentiful with real scrambled eggs, biscuits, bacon, fruit, juice...and the evening cocktails/soda and wings, chips, baked potatoes, hotdogs, veggies, dips, chicken fingers were plentiful and a great alternative to eating out again. We had a big lunch so just snack food was perfect allowing us time to enjoy the pool on the ROOF!! Parking is fenced, selfpark right next to the hotel for about 17. It is within easy walking distance of the famous Mother's...and all the traditional New Orleans favorites. When you consider the price of breakfast and the free alcoholic beverages and snacks...it is so worth the price....I think with parking included we paid about 150 tops. I am ready to go there again!
This is not your typical Drury inn! This is no cookie cutter hotel. We were very surprised at the lovely lobby and rooms at this hotel. We loved the staff who were very helpful on our first trip to New Orleans and the rooms have high ceilings with impressive tall windows.The beds were very comfortable and any troubles we had were addressed immediately. The hotel is within walking distance of the French Quarter if you want a small hike, but we did drive and park. There are closer hotels.They offer 3 complimentary drinks per night for guests and the free breakfast is very good.All this at a very attractive rate. We got there same day and were able to get a discounted rate.Overall, I would stay here again and again!
I traveled to New Orleans with my husband for a 3 night stay. This was our first trip here and we had a blast! The Drury Inn was the perfect place to stay! The breakfast was perfect, the free drinks/food at happy hour were a plus, and the staff couldn't have been more friendly!. Our room was very clean, bigger than I expected (just a standard room) and the bathroom had a marble look. The in-room fridge microwave was awesome. We utilized the pool every day and it was very quiet and refreshing. The fitness room contained 2 treadmills 1 bike and a flat screen tv. No weights, but at least there was a place to run off some fun from the night before! The location was a few short blocks to anything and everything! We always opted for the main streets, and never felt scared on any of our walks around town (even at 2am). We will stay here again the next time we visit for sure! Make sure to get a hand grenade at Tropical Isle. 3 will get the job done. Enjoy!!!!!
Stayed 3 nights in a 2 room suite (we were a party of 3 adults). The location was very convenient. The French Quarter was a short walk and the area was very safe. Close to the trolley and the WWII Museum. The suite was large, but the bedroom had no window and the window in the other room had no view. The sofa bed did not pull out easily, so my son just slept on the sofa which he was ok with. It was nice having the extra space privacy with 2 rooms and the price was right. The complimentary breakfast was nice. We didn't make much use of the evening social hour because who wants to eat hot dogs chips when there is such great food in New Orleans, but if you are a family economizing you could easily make a meal out of it. It looked like the hotel does a lot of tour business.
First this hotel (in the CBD) actually has parking right at the door available making my life easy. The package deals this hotel offers make it a good value for the entire family as it includes a fantastic New Orleans breakfast and the pool on the roof is a plus.
This hotel was an example of 'Southern Hospitality'. At check in the lady (I am sorry but I dont recall her name) was sheer professionalism and charm. Clearly she has been here a long time and made fell very welcome. The rooms are excellent and spotless. Self serve drinks and snacks after 3pm are great and breakfast is excellent. All other facilities are great and internet/free printing very useful. The location is great - far enough away from the noise of Bourbon St but only a 5 minute walk. Convenience store 3 blocks away and downtown shops, etc close too. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.
This hotel is great!!!! The staff are friendly and helpful. Great cocktail hour and a pretty good breakfast. The rooms are nice and a good size. Great parking rate! You get some great extras with your stay which is nice. The hotel is next to a trolley car stop which is nice. FYI if you have never been to the city buy an all day pass for the trolley. Its 3 per person for all day on and off stops. best deal around. It includes the buses in that pass as well. I have only two minor complaints and one is that the food during cocktail hour did not have healthy options for those that are watching their diet. The other was that we were next to the housekeeping closet and they were kindof loud early in the morning. Overall great experience and will book this hotel again!!!!
Great hotel. We did not meet one unfriendly staff member. Called asking for early check-in and they were happy to accommodate. Located in the center of the various NOLA districts - walking distance to French Quarter/Garden District/Warehouse District/etc. The hotel's Kickback Hour was better than anticipated. Every night there is salad bar/soups/chicken tenders/baked potato/etc. in addition to 3/night complimentary alcoholic drinks. The pool area was also very nice. Recommend this hotel all the way around! :)
This was our second trip here during Mardi Gras. This hotel is older, but everything is up to date. The suites are large and clean. We stayed on the 7th floor suites which included a mini fridge, microwave, and front lounge area with separate tv. The staff here is awesome. The plus for us is, this hotel is located around 1 block of the parade route. Being at the end of the route also gives you the opportunity to score bags and bags stuff being slung off the floats. It's also so close that if you have to use the restroom, you have a clean private restroom right around the corner. If you don't mind the walk, this location is also only around half a mile from Burbon and French Quarter. There are other hotels near, but we enjoy this hotel enough that we would continue to lock down a room during this party.They also have a buffet breakfast, nothing fancy... eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, cereal, grits, biscuit and gravy. From 530-7p they have happy hour which includes 3 drinks.
My husband and I stayed here 2 days prior to cruise (Jan. 20 and 21st) and one day post cruise (Jan. 30). It was a perfect stay for us! The room was large, bed comfy, and we really enjoyed the free hot breakfast and free kick back hour in the evening. We basically had two free meals a day, with three free drinks each evening. Very clean hotel, close to the cruise port, and friendly staff. We will definitely be back next time we visit New Orleans!
My wife and I stayed at the Drury on Poydras on Friday night before the Jazz Half Marathon. We had stayed at the Drury before and enjoyed it very much. This time was no different. The hotel is clean and comfortable with a large inviting lobby. The have adopted valet-only parking which at 25 is expensive, but in line with other hotels in the area. The valets were very helpful and the service was excellent. The hotel offers a complimentary evening happy hour and breakfast with rather good food. We had a corner room, which was not a suite, but very spacious with a whirlpool bath. The room was comfortable, quiet, and had a nice view. The Drury is located at the edge of the French Quarter and provides easy access to the major sites. We had the added benefit of being only 1 block from the race start line at Lafayette Square. Overall, this is a fantastic place to stay in NOLA.
I have stayed here many times since 2005 I am never disappointed. The new rooms in the new addition are great. Really big and spacious. Plus the evening meal and the morning breakfast are a wonderful addition. After visiting museums and shopping all day, we didn't want to go out to restaurant. The evening meal offered baked potatoes, grilled chicken, pasta, salad, hot dogs chili. We put together a nice meal without having to leave the hotel. Then the next morning, we had a complete breakfast before heading off to the Aquarium. All the staff were very professional helpful. Thank you Drury Inn.
The Drury was close enough to the French Quarter that I could walk after the long day in meetings. The room was comfortable and felt homey. The staff were helpful and the the little extras were a definite bonus. I'm going to stay here again when I come back to New Orleans.
If you want a hotel close to the French Quarter rather than in it with all its noise, crowds and street entertainers and scam artists this is the perfect place. You are only four blocks from Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street or the streetcar stops right outside the hotel if you don't feel like walking. 3 for a 24 hour pass is a good deal and an easy way to move around all the key tourist areas. The Drury Inn offers excellent accommodation for the money: we had an oversized 2 room suite King Bed Non-Smoking suite for five nights which was clean, comfortable, well laid out. The Breakfast and Kick Back offerings should be seen as a bonus: it's quite naturally geared to US tastes and if you like what's on offer then enjoy (we did for the most part) if not then there are plenty of good eating spots within easy reach. As for the three alcoholic drinks each night what's to complain about Just be aware there are quite long lines on Friday and Saturday nights. Finally, many thanks to Kyle, Assistant General Manager, for the useful chats we had about New Orleans/ Memphis and Daniel always helpful and courteous in the dining room.
I recently stayed at the Drury Inn for 3 nights. I was assigned a corner room on the 6th fl that had two exposures of Poydras street. I was very satisfied with the room. It was quiet (some minor street noise), very well appointed, had a nice whirlpool type jet tub, and the TV channel selection was decent. The room was clean and well cared for. The hotel was very nice, had some character, and was close to most of what people want to see when visiting New Orleans. However, it was a few blocks from most of those attractions, which I didnt mind, but someone who wants to be in the thick of the action might find it disappointing being in the business district where the hotel is. The walk to the waterfront or Bourbon Street was about 6 blocks and felt safe even at night. The free food and drink was a big plus. The breakfast offerings met all my expectations. Well-cooked scrambled eggs, waffles, bagels, etc. The afternoon happy hour selection was weaker. The hot dogs were consistently under cooked and somewhat unattractive in appearance. I would say beef was either non-existent or way down on the ingredients listing. The other foods were satisfactory, but nothing off the charts. Hey, but this was all free, so I cant subtract points. But if you plan on feasting your physician will take exception with your meal choices. In a general sense, based on observations at various times during my midweek visit, this hotel tends to attract a somewhat older crowd.say vacationing retirees. I only saw 1 child during my 3 day visit and limited people in their 40s or less. My only real issue with the hotel was the fitness center. It literally consisted of 2 treadmills and a bike. Nothing else. If a hotel advertises offering such an amenity, I dont think such a limited offering qualifies. While there was a sign up suggesting an improved offering will be forthcoming when the new hotel wing is complete, that didnt help me on my visit and I only consider hotels that offer such because I plan on using them. I wasnt able to here.All in all, I was satisfied with my stay despite the fitness center misrepresentation. I would not hesitate to select the Drury on a future stay.
The room are old but have modern conveniences. The staff are outstanding. The front desk clerks are great. Very friendly and helpful. The maid service was OK but not great. Would definitely stay here again.
This is a classic looking hotel located very close to the French Quarter in the city centre. Offered is the excellent Drury value with the breakfast and 5 o'clock kickbacks. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The service was excellent. I really could not find fault with this hotel and would definitely use it again.
We took a detour from North Louisiana on our anniversary weekend-forgetting that it was also St. Patrick's Day! We ended up in New Orleans and enjoyed touring many familiar and favorite neighborhoods. We made our way slowing down Magazine Street close to where we onced lived and realized that a St. Patrick's Day parade was wrapping up! Desperate to find accommodations my husband walked into the Drury Inn on Poydras St. and booked the last room of the hotel.The lobby was lively with happy hour and we enjoyed a quick glass of wine before going to our room on the first floor! We were amazed at the quality and comfort considering the low price we were offered! ( Ask for those military and senior discounts.) The staff was courteous and friendly, the room quiet and comfortable! The inn is close to the quarter and cost a mere 6 for a friendly cab ride! We were dropped off right at the start of the parade on Bourbon St and enjoyed a after-parade drink in another hotel on Canal. We were fortunate to meet the Grand Marshall's family and enjoy their story of life in and around New Orleans! Parking is extra but well worth the price and peace of mind knowing your car is being cared for in an off-site location.
Great professional staff. Clean rooms. nice pool. The FREE breakfast and afternoon buffet were a very big bonus. As were the complimentary cocktails. Trolley is just outside the hotel. the valet parking was reasonable. I would definitely stay there again.
We were pleased to find that our room was so large. Beds were very comfortable and the hotel itself was close to everything. We were able to walk everywhere. The breakfast selection was very good. The drinks and snacks in the early evening were a very pleasant surprise. I would not hesitate to stay in another Drury Hotel.
We arrived just before Mardi Gras yet had no probelm booking this hotel. Though centrally located, It is a good walk from most areas. The trolley stops just a block away which is nice. Take a ride -- and see how close it comes to parked vehicles. Breakfast is always a treat, though Drury San Antonio had a wider variety of choices. And at 5:30pm it looked like guests actually dine on the wings, baked potatoes, hot dogs and the chili provided in lieu of heading out to dinner. Rouses, an attractive grocery, is nearby for quick fill-ins or paninis made to order or practically anything else food-related. The bed, in my opinion, was a bit soft as were the pillows. I wish they had queen-size beds too. The staff is very accommodating and willing to make suggestions for clubs, restaurants or attractions. The Drury is clean and modern and is currently building an addition which should provide more variety of rooms and maybe even a fancier breakfast. Oh, they even arranged for transportation from the airport.
This was our first trip to New Orleans, so we had no experience with hotels in the city. We found the Drury Inn and Suites through reading reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews were very helpful, and we are so glad that we stayed at the Drury. Our room was very nice, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. All the staff that we spoke to were very friendly and helpful. Wifi and breakfast are included in the price of the room as well as the 5:30 KIckback with three drinks per person and snacks. Another of the reasons that we chose this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor was that the hotel is close enough to walk to the French Quarter and Canal Street, but far enough from the noise of Bourbon Street that you could actually get a good night's sleep. We were able to walk to the French Quarter for sightseeing and to the restaurants. The street cars to get to the Garden District or City Park are also within walking distance.We would definitely recommend the Drury Inn Suites to friends or family without hesitation and it would be our first choice as a hotel when we go back to New Orleans.
I live within an hour of New Orleans, so I go often. I have stayed in many hotels. The Drury Inn became my go-to hotel. But it has been a while since I stayed overnight in NOLA. My last Drury review, the hotel was the greatest thing since man canned beer. But upgrades have knocked it down a notch. First the positives: it is about 4 blocks off of the French Quarter. So certainly close enough to walk in a couple minutes, but far enough away that it is quiet. You can actually sleep when you are ready. The breakfast is awesome with eggs, grits (real creamy grits), sausage, waffle makers, plus, plus. The 5pm kick back includes 3 free drinks and enough real food to count as dinner. While you have to eat at some NOLA restaurants to get the full NOLA experience, free breakfast and free dinner easily can save you 100 a day as a couple, making the trip more affordable. The rooms are updated, clean and comfortable.My only negative is the updates. They used to have free self parking. Now there is ONLY 28 a day for valet parking. Don't rent a car if you are flying in. The city is very walkable. But when you drive in like me, it really ups the cost. Then the convenience of the valet parking is negated by the very poor management of the process. You can not call down from your room to have your car pulled up front like any other hotel. You have to come down in person. For most of my stay there was only 1 guy around. He was fetching other cars and it took forever to get ours. Same thing when you return to the hotel. No one around, and you may wait 20-30 minutes to drop off your car. Frustrating to say the least. I would have MUCH, MUCH rather self parked.Thanks for your recent stay with us, and the kind words about the hotel and its offerings. Also, thanks for feedback on the parking. As you noted, we do only have valet parking now and it is at a fee. I was not aware of free parking in the past, but did some digging and found that in 2010, when construction on the addition began and during your last stay, free parking was offered. Also, please know that we do allow for call down for car retrieval as long as it is not raining or a large check-out. I will get with the valet team, and repeat that these are the only periods when guests are asked to come down. We look forward to seeing you again,Patrick D. General Manager
Stayed here for two nights while visiting New Orleans for the first time. Walking distance to historical and party districts or catch a trolley car to the river for 1.25. Room was clean and nicely decorated - but you probably won't spend much time there. The hotel is a gorgeous, renovated old building. Wish I would have looked up the history of it while we were there. Located on a busy road but on the 4th floor we didn't hear the noise of the city. Stayed on south side - view is similar on all sides.Parking was 25/night.Traveled with adult child and we would stay there again!
This hotel is quiet but within walking distance to Bourbon Street and the French Quarter. If you want to ride the street cars there is a stop right on the St. Charles line right outside the door. Be sure to go to the 'kick-back' from 5:30 - 7:00 every evening. When you go up for your drink, try to get Edward as your bartender as he really knows how to pour a drink.
We stayed in this hotel for two nights on our way to Destin, Florida. I made a mistake in booking the room. We have four children and I meant to book a suite. I accidentally booked a double queen. Aliya at the front desk very graciously fixed the problem immediately. She was so friendly and accommodating. We were given a great suite right next to the pool - which our kids loved. The room was clean, but we had a problem with the toilet not flushing. Again, this was fixed immediately and in a friendly manner. We did not have another problem with it during our stay. The pool was extremely clean and we used it both days and evenings. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room in our suite. The breakfast offered a large variety and was a good value. They also offered a dinner with drinks. We ate out and ate a little from the dinner. My kids had the pasta and said it was good. The staff was extremely helpful with our eating out plans, sight seeing plans, and transportation plans. We've stayed at a lot of hotels and this staff ranks in the top five for helpfulness and friendliness.
The hotel was very nice, within walking distance of alot of the places we wanted to go. Just a couple blocks from the stadium, French Quarter, and the river. Very quiet and very clean! We always get the 2 room suites, with fridge and microwave, 2 tvs. Always ask for away from elevator if possible
Ok, let me start by saying I do not care for hotels so it's rare that I'm impressed by one. I recently visited the New Orleans for the first time the weekend after Mardi Gras. We decided to walk around before checking in and it became late in the day. I received a call from the hotel manager who called to let me know they would still hold our room for us. I thought that was very nice. We arrived at the hotel and I was skeptical when I saw the outside of the building. My boyfriend reassured me that inside was probably much nicer and most buildings in New Orleans look like that on the outside. I was amazed from the moment we stepped foot in the lobby!!! The staff were courteous and the room was more than clean. I always inspect the bed and the shower upon entering my room and I couldn't find ONE thing to complain about, which is very rare lol. We also went down to the 5:30 Kickback where the hotel provided free food and and drinks. Overall, our stay was well worth every penny spent!! I have to say this will be my hotel of choice from now on whenever I visit.
Clean rooms, excellent location. We walked to the French Quarter, the Aquarium, and the St. Charles St. street car is a block away. Enjoyed the free breakfast and happy hour! When walking home from the French Quarter at night, I'd suggest walking back up Royal Street rather than Bourbon, as when you cross Canal Street, its better lit and less desolate. We never had a problem either way, however.
My family and I stayed for Mardi Gras. We stayed in the King suite. We had plenty of room. The room was very clean. This was my second visit and won't be my last. The beds are super comfy! The pillows are plump and comfy! So nice to relax in after walking bourbon and canal. Love the roof top pool and hot tub. It's intimate and has a great view.
Very clean and comfortable room. Staff was friendly and courteous. Everything went according to plan from reservations to payment. Nice stay for the price and happy to hear it is dog friendly for my next trip. Enjoyable experience and I will return.
As usual number one place to stay. Love the friendly staff for the most part did have one cranky one in the drink part. Breakfast and dinner was good. Recommend Room 221. Where around the corner under the Corredor there is the elevator that takes it down to the lunch room And to the rooftop pool. Prices are comparable to the local area. Fridge and coffee in the room. About five blocks from Canel Street and into the French quarters. Walking distance which we did. But there is also a street car service available right outside of the corner lot
Very good value for the money. Breakfast is good, kickback food is nice, heated pool and hot tub and location is close enough that you can walk to french quarter or convention center. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Perhaps one of the best pet friendly hotel I have stayed in
Highly recommend this hotel. Well located, large foyer, clean rooms and pleasant swimming pool. The breakfast was very good and the kick back was much better than we had expected. A reasonable choice of snacks and 3 drinks per person. Management were very visible at meal times and they ran like clockwork, all staff attentive and professional so no messy tables. Slade in particular was friendly and welcoming to all the guests. We will look to book with this brand when we next travel to the USA and hope they are all of this standard.
Great hotel, wonderful hospitality, staff funny and very helpful. Rooms nice and clean. Beds comfortable. We were in a suite, the living room was comfy, ample workspace for two people. We were there the week before Mardi Gras on a business trip. Check in evening, our toilet overflows, we use all the towels in the bathroom to mop after we disable the float. Call to front desk. Immediate response. Front desk guy has a plunger and a plastic bag, comes in an plunges the toilet. Clears the paper. Says he's not supposed to plunge toilets. Leaves us with wet towels (and used toilet water) behind the toilet. Fortunately, the room is not level, so all the water stays mostly behind the toilet. Housekeeping gone, so fortunately, we still had two clean towels for a.m. and the detritus is not near our feet. Next day, some towels replaced, and housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom and skimpy on towels. Second day, housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom. Third day I notice that a little piece of plastic wrapping that I had binding some brochures in my suitcase was still laying on the floor in the bedroom. Shower has not great water pressure but is nice and roomy too. Hair dryer was awful. One day we were still in the room when housekeeping came, and when we came back in the early evening our room was not done. A call to front desk and our room was cleaned (with the leftover spray bottle in the bathroom) by time we got back from dinner.So, it's clean but some staff are a little forgetful. I was not bothered by the issues, it's a quirky little hotel. With a quirky staff...very laid back and quite fun!What did bother me, though, was one day I went down for breakfast. A youth bus group had been there the night before and they devestated the free breakfast bar. By 7:30 a.m. (the breakfast is open until 9 or so), most of the hot food was gone, and the server said they were done for the day. Huh Otherwise, the breakfast bar was nice, all the usual stuff. The evening reception was really nice. The hotel is close to convention center, French Quarter, and all the fun places.Overall, I'd stay there again, I'm hoping that the housekeeping issues were quirks and next time I'm bringing my own hair dryer. It did have free internet in the rooms, a huge plus.
We like to stay at this hotel when we come home for Mardi Gras because it is so close to the parade route. They have so many extra perks and the rate is better than most super hotels in the area. We can't wait to go again next year.
We stayed here to celebrate a milestone birthday for my cousin. It was perfect! Great location (easy to walk or take the streetcar to anywhere). We enjoyed the free breakfast and free happy hour! Spent every night outside in the lovely weather hanging out. Staff was really nice and receptive. Would stay here again.
Great value for money, fantastic suite with large flat screen tv in each room. Spotlessly clean, friendly helpful staff and the bonus of free drinks and snacks after 5.30 pm. My only negative comment is paying 17 plus tax per night for parking but you are made aware of this before you book. The hotel is in easy walking distance of the French Quarter and also the Casino.
I commend the staff at Drury for achieving some of the highest quality customer service I've experienced. So often employees get jaded, bring their personal lives into work, and/or generally take out their personal problems with others at the workplace. The week we were there we enjoyed smiles and pleasantries every morning from the ladies at breakfast, Rosa (room attendant), and those working the desk. Not to leave out Jonathan, Jeremy, and Brandon, our Valet's. These guys were very pleasant and gave off a great spirit while taking care of our vehicle making sure it was always ready to roll, often on short notice. I witnessed them actually running to provide positive service for us and other guests. All in all everyone we came in contact with were great representatives for this company. I will continue to seek out Drury for our travels. I'm Wardog and I approve this message.
I stayed at the Drury Inn for four nights in early January. This was the weekend of the national football championship final between Iowa and LSU, and the hotel seemed to be full of people that had come to New Orleans for the game.My room was spacious, clean, and nice and I had free wireless access to the internet. The service was good. I wasn't too happy with the breakfast, although there was a selection of different foods, coffee, pops, etc. available. Considering the price range, I was quite happy with the hotel and wouldn't mind staying there again.
We stayed here 3 days before a cruise. Front desk help - excellent. walking distance to most places and if not, the streetcar stops just outside the door. hot breakfast each morning and kickback food served in the evening. really saved us . Very clean and friendly place to stay. When we come back, will stay again.
We found the General Manager, Patrick to give great assistance during our 8 day stay. The location is great for the city and convention area. The rooms have been renovated in the older area and renovation was taking place while we were there not causing any disturbance. We would highly recommend this location for business or leisure travel. Located less than 1 block to the on-off bus and 3 blocks from Mother's restaurant. Hopefully we will return next year.
This place was a good walking distance from the French quarter and the riverside and it had happy hour where you get free food and 3 free drinks which is great. The room was nice and we were able to do our laundry here which is great on a road trip.
Stayed at the hotel during a conference. The Drury was not one of the conference hotels, but it was 100 per night cheaper. I got a suite for 90.00. The hotel was 1/2 block from the conference shuttle stop. Very clean, spacious and nice hotel. The breakfast is convenient (if you want Denny's go there. This isn't Denny's) and a great extra. Staff was pleasant. A short walk to the FQ. Absoultely would stay here again.
Not too bad for price. Liked the free drinks, popcorn, and breakfast. It fit our needs and was pretty convenient to a lot of points of interest. The front desk was very nice, let us check in early and was able to recommend a couple of restaurants for big families. Needed room key to access elevator, so we felt more secure. Rooms and bed were comfortable, no complaints.
Nice looking hotel, nice rooms and amenities, Not as good as other drury hotels i have stayed at, the food wasnt great, and drinks were very watered down. and one night i was loudly awakened at 1.30am from the fire alarm, had to rush down the steps 7 floors, stand outside for 15 mins for someone to tell us the front desk staff hit the wrong button, not acceptable.Thank you for your recent stay, and please accept my apologies for the fire alarm. As you know, the timing was awful, but the issue has been repaired. I hope you will give us another chance next time your travels bring you back to New Orleans!Sincerely,Patrick D.GM, DIS-NWO
My husband and I spent another weekend in NOLA recently for a college football bowl game. We chose the Drury for their consistency and great location. This time we were able to take advantage of their evening wind down happy hour. While the drinks were not of great quality, it's still a nice amenity. The hot dogs and nachos were a nice snack before our big game. The breakfast was most enjoyable. As always the room was very clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The location is perfect for Superdome events and not a bad walk from Canal and Bourbon street activities as well.
Drury New Orleans was great and I even changed my reservation 3 different times. The last time they booked us for a suite the first night (because of lack of availability) and booked us the regular room the other nights. However, when we arrived, they let us have the suite for all 3 nights and did not charge additional (I might add that it was during the week). This way we didn't have to change rooms. Valet parking, although expensive, was great w/not too long of a wait. Free breakfast (multiple waffle makers, sausage, eggs, pastries, gravy, fruit etc.--not super high quality but better than a lot of hotels), snack type dinner (hotdogs, chicken strips, meatballs, etc..--again, not super high quality but plenty of food excellent offerings especially if you are on a budget), and free popcorn pops from 3-10pm. You could actually eat breakfast at the hotel, dinner at the hotel and then only pay for lunch if you wanted to. My absolutely only complaint about this hotel was that they offered 3 alcoholic drinks for each adult in the evening 5-7 during dinner (only 3 different drinks offered). We are not big drinkers but like to have one from time to time. We ordered one 2 different nights but were unable to drink them because they were so incredibly strong--we even asked to go light on the alcohol to no avail. We were also disappointed they didn't have a full bar where you could pay for a frozen drink if you wanted. Other than that small detail this hotel was really clean, nice clean pool w/plenty of clean towels, friendly staff, quiet and close enough to walk to shops and such. It seemed to be located between the Garden District the French Quarter. We definitely would return.
We were very pleasantly surprised when we stayed here for 2 nights prior to sailing on the Carnival Fantasy. We booked 2 rooms at around 65/night each, which included a nightly happy hour and an above-average breakfast buffet (with decent scrambled eggs, waffle machine, etc).This is an older property which has been renovated very nicely. The rooms are small but functional. Everything was quite clean and staff was courteous and efficient (except for recommending dinner at Mulate's - see separate review).We were less than a 10-minute walk from the Vieux Carre, which we walked to and from several times, never feeling unsafe or nervous for a single moment.To be so close to downtown, yet in a safe location, and get decent accommodations for a modest price in a very expensive city, the Drury is an outstanding value. We would definitely stay there again.
We stayed here in March, 2014. They are having construction going on but it did not cause us any problem. We had a rental car and used the valet service. It was efficient and courteous. Check-in was easy.Security is good. You have to use your room key to use the elevator. The room was clean and had a mini-refrigerator and flat screen television that also had digital channel selections. The bed was very comfortable. The curtains kept the light out when closed.They have an evening buffet, which was very good. You also get up to three individual selections of beer or mixed drinks. Breakfast was very good also and has wide selection. They also have popcorn and soft drink area that is open until around 10 pm daily.The hotel is about three blocks from the French Quarter which is easy to walk and convenient. Getting in and out from the hotel by car is easy, much easier than from within the French Quarter.We had no problems here. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel.
We stayed for 5 nights and were impressed by this hotel.We stayed in a room with a nice view of the French Quarter. The employees were very warm, and one of them, Christine, went out of her way to make us comfortable. We had a little unpleasant experience on the first night, but were impressed by how efficiently it was dealt with. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience.
The room was great staff pleasant only 1 mile from French Quarter location great definetly would stay here again .The hotel had a good breakfast buffet and light snacks and refreshments in the mid afternoon and a light supper buffet 3 free alchol beverages a night and a 15 min long distance call a day home.
Three of us recently stayed here during the Women's Final Four. The hotel decor was lovely and the staff was more than accommodating. We had a two room suite. The rooms were quite large and the ceilings were very high so it was extremely quiet. We also appreciated that the sink vanity area were outside the bathroom since there were three of us.The free breakfast was mediocre in my opinion and the 5:30 kickback was great for families, but with so many fantastic New Orleans restaurants I wasn't about to fill up on chips, hot dogs, mac and cheese, etc. The location is within walking distance of the New Orleans Arena and the French Quarter, but because of a knee injury that wasn't possible for me. The hotel is very secure. A hotel key is needed to access the elevator. There is a great grocery store within a couple of blocks for anything you may need.
We had a great stay at the Drury. The breakfast and evening apps were excellent and a great money saving bonus. The location was great with the Hop on Hop off bus just across the road. Within walking distance to French Quarter and Bourbon Street. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Would definitely stay there again
Spent a week here last year. From the moment we walked in to reception the staff couldn't be more helpful. Saw the manager everyday walking around talking to everyone. Usual American breakfast plenty of it, but not to my taste, but saying that I found it same at all the hotels we stayed in for the month we were touring around the southern states. Plenty of fresh fruit, toast, oatmeal which was fine for me. Good coffee and tea was ok when you used two tea bags!! Room was large and extremely comfortable, nice bathroom and very clean. Plenty of towels and toiletries and good quality. Loved the pool on the roof and the Managers Reception every evening was an added bonus and very much appreciated. Would stay there again if we ever come back to new Orleans.
We called earily and set things up,they said we could come anytime to check in.that was at 8:00 am, most say 3:00 pm.stayed in room 903 with a good view for less then we were paying for average. Found shower was great, bed good and the two tv's and two rooms made life very easy for us. It's a easy walk to the French quarters, a few blocks. They park your car for you and it cost 25.00
From the start amazing, i cannot fault this place at all, hats off to everybody at the Drury Inn.We will be back to America and we will be staying here again, free snacks, drinks, popcorn.If you have a family this is a must and guarantee you will not be let down by the amazing staff and the complex itself.10/10
We stayed two nights. The hotel is deceptive from the outside - it looks very plain and ordinary but it is just the opposite on the inside. The lobby is very attractive and welcoming. The room was clean, comfortable and large with vaulted ceilings and very tastefully decorated. We enjoyed the happy hour with three free alcoholic drinks each and hot and cold snacks. Breakfast was also included - fairly typical choices of cereal, scrambled eggs etc.. The staff were very friendly. It's in a great location - the cable car stops out front and it's an easy 5 minute walk to Bourbon St. We will definitely stay here again.
Having stayed in four other hotels in the French Quarter over the years during Jazzfest this is the only hotel I'd go back too. This hotel is in the Central Business District about a ten minute safe walk from the Quarter. Courteous helpful staff, clean and very nice room and hotel. Avoid the craziness and noise of some of the hotels in quarter and stay here. Also closer to the Garden District.
Very pleasant stay here. The Hotel is beautiful. The view on the rooftop pool Is beautiful. They have a free breakfast in the mornings, free appetizer type dinner in the evenings, free cocktails for you and your guest. The rooms are small but very nice....More
My family enjoyed our stay here. This hotel is located a few blocks away from the French Quarter and a block away from St. Charles Streetcar. It is very accessible you can walk to and from French Quarter from day to night without any problem. You can also go to the Garden District by taking the Streetcar without any hassle. They also offer free breakfast, free dinner (and some cocktails) and free snacks which are a major plus. This helps a lot especially when you're on a budget.If you're driving to NOLA, this hotel offers valet parking for 25 + tax. The other hotels' parking costs around 35-40 so this one offers a pretty good value. It's actually difficult to find a parking space in French Quarter, so I advise for you guys to just walk. But, we did drive one time when we booked a swamp tour.We liked NOLA a lot and we're definitely coming back! Next time, we won't have to scout for hotels because we would rather stay at Drury Inn again!
This hotel was a pleasant surprise. Great price which includes breakfast and a happy hour with enough food for dinner. If you are trying to save money, and you have your kids or aging parents, this the place. Do ask for rooms in the new wing. Our first non smoking room in the old section, while lovely, smell of smoke. I asked for a new room, and they upgraded us into a suite in the new section. Super responsive to our request. The hotel is large and might seem impersonal, but it works for us... A base camp for exploring NOLA.
Spacious suite room, good breakfast and included happy hour. Friendly and helpful staff. Good location between French quarter and WWII museum. Travelled with family- location right by st Charles trolley
I have stayed at his hotel many times since 2005 it just gets better better. Check in is super easy, valet parking is great, and now the new evening meal is a wonderful addition to their already great breakfast. We stayed in room 830, in the new addition on 7-23 with my niece her 4 young children. This was a king suite with a roll away bed, we had a great nights sleep. This room has a view of the pool. We all enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed the evening meal the breakfast before going to the Aquarium the next day.
We were in town for the Sugar Bowl. The hotel is a good location for those who are ok to walk about 10 min down to the Dome. Also close to a couple good restaurants. We felt very safe when we walked from the hotel. Also love the breakfast!!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel for four days during September 2012. A home away from home! Service and customer focused staff in all areas of the hotel looked after customers with genuine care. Every evening from 5.30pm they have the Manager's reception, which entails a free drink of your choice and extensive snacks. both hot and cold food. The breakfast is very adequate (cereals. eggs. waffles, juices, toast etc) .. and there are number of dishes. Perhaps some cut up fruit would have been good but there was bananas and apples available. There is coffee, juice, soda. Iced water available any time of the day in the reception area.The pool on the rooftop is excellent with strangely enough few guests using it....which suited us very well. always sparkling clean and fresh towels available. The small gym got a little hot and stuffy after 8am as the sun streamed in through a number of windows. We walked an easy walk to the riverfront where you can catch the street car. There usually is a street car operating outside the hotel but maintenance work was in progress when we stayed and only buses were available. The hotel has just commenced the building of a new wing and originally was due for completion in June 2013 but now completion is expected December 2013. We stayed in room 821 and had a small balcony overlooking the early stages of the construction sight. Didn't experience any inconvenience or noise. In fact had a lovely view at night as there was nothing obstructing our view, but this will change as the new hotel wing progresses. You will be fine for several months until this occurs. There is a small fridge and microwave in the cupboard which is adequate but go down to Frenchmen's Street for some great cafes and restaurants. Go to Coups Place for great Cajun food and cheap too! There is no doorman opening and closing doors. but who cares with all the other advantages one has in staying in this delightful hotel. So nice to know that management staff care about you and your stay at their hotel! Would recommend this hotel without any concern. When you book in 2013 to stay just first ask about the construction progress so you can enjoy your stay free of any inconvenience.
My husband is a HUGE NO Saints fan - this hotel was great for our stay. There were so many free extras: internet, microwave, fridge, breakfast - but the happy hour was the nicest. This hotel is in an excellent location, not far from the French Quarter, the pier, and the Superdome! The staff was more than friendly! We will stay here again!
We stayed here three nights while visiting New Orleans. The hot breakfast, free drinks 'finger food', and free wifi were very good. The room was well appointed and well maintained. The thermostat was easy to operate and kept the room at the proper temperature. The bed was super comfortable.The hotel was in a walking distance to the French Quarter and the WWII museum.I would definitely stay here again when in NO.
This was a business trip for 3 nights chosen for it's very close proximity to where I had to attend a business class. Valet parking was very quick efficient, both coming going. The desk clerks were very friendly, efficient and accommodating. The room was sparkling clean and nicely appointed (I was in the older part but couldn't have asked for a better room). My room faced Poydras, so may have been a little better view than other parts of the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised that the bathroom/vanity area had very nice bright lighting and the water pressure and hot water were excellent. Nice extras - 3 complimentary alcoholic drinks and a nice assortment of foods during the 5:30-7pm evening cocktail/food period.. meatballs, ziti pasta, hot dogs, chips, cheese dip, salad bar, chicken fingers, baked potatoes, etc. in a nice large open area to dine, so even though there were many people taking advantage of this, it wasn't uncomfortably crowded and the food bars were well-attended. Though I did not get the opportunity to see much of the city, it was definitely within walking distance of the riverwalk area and the French Quarter. I definitely will stay here again.
We were only staying in NOLA for one night before our cruise and stayed at this hotel. It was very nice and secure. Your room key was also a means to get into the hotel after a certain point at night and to also use the elevator. (We've never experienced security quite like that before ).. the hotel is in a very nice part of NOLA, however...it's about 4 blocks from the French Quarter so it is quiet. I would definitely consider staying here again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet hotel that's not too far from all of the action.
I'll keep this short since there are plenty of other reviews but this was probably my most pleasant hotel stay ever up til now! Free breakfast, free light dinner with drinks, very clean room, friendly staff, great location, on-site self-parking in gated parking lot (not a fan of valet parking myself). No complaints!
Everything was pretty good. The hotel is a little older but its kept up pretty well. The rooms were clean and spacious enough. The staff was very friendly and helpful. And the free breakfast and evening drinks and snacks were a nice surprise. Good centralized location too, not too far from the French Quarter.
This hotel is on Poydras Street, which is about a 7 min walk from the French Quarter. It is a safe area, and the advantage of its location vs staying within the Quarter is that it is quiet at night and closer to the Superdome and basketball arena, Riverwalk area, and the excellent National WWII Museum. It is also very close to a really good diner called Mothers if you don't want to walk to the Quarter for a meal.The hotel offers large, clean rooms, complementary breakfast, free drinks and coffee, free dinner (they call it a snack, but with hot dogs, fried chicken, meatballs, vegetables and cocktails, I call it a buffet dinner), and friendly, helpful service.Only drawbacks are the somewhat insipid breakfast, and the old building and rooms (which admittedly is part of the charm).All in all, a great choice.
We stayed her for a night while visiting New Orleans and was very pleased with our choice of hotel.The hotel was very well located to walk around the city and a good location for driving into.The hotel room itself was an average size and big enough for our needs. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The room had a fridge and coffee making facilities but did not have a safe. The bathroom was a bit on the small side with a toilet and bath with shower over and a sink outside the bathroom. The bathroom again was very clean. The room was very quiet we never heard a noise all night.There was valet parking available for 30 per night.The complimentary breakfast was good, there was plenty of choice and it was well organised with a clean breakfast area and helpful staff.The night reception was excellent. There was unlimited soft drinks available, 3 alcoholic drinks per person and food. The food was best we have ever seen at an evening reception this included hot dogs, nachos, baked potatoes, salad, chilli.There was also popcorn available late afternoon into the night time available in the lobby area along with coffee and soft drinks. I think soft drinks were also available for a few hours inthe morning. The staff at the hotel reception were very friendly and helpful.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New Orleans and if we ever return I would stay here. I will also look out for Drury Inns now when our travels.
We spent almost a week here and really appreciated the convenience and value. With your stay, you get a free breakfast, an early evening snack which is pretty much a meal, three free drinks per person per night, a rooftop swimming pool and jacuzzi and close proximity to much in New Orleans. Staff is friendly and helpful. Nightly rates will vary according to season, holidays and days of the week, but we were greatly satisfied with what we paid. Look for deals online. Our room wa well-appointed, classy and comfortable. This hotel will only get better after all renovations are complete. That they accept pets makes it all the better.
Hotel a few blocks away from the French Quarter. It is also convenient to transit. The room we received was a good size and comfortable. The hotel offers a good continental breakfast in the morning, popcorn and fountain drinks in the afternoon, and kickbacks starting at 5.30pm. There was some good munchies especially for teenagers. There offer free wi fi, which was added bonus. We would stay here again,
I was looking for a place that wasn't too expensive as we would only be sleeping there...this was it. Nice accomodations, good price and a surprisingly good complimentary continental breakfast. This saved us time and money because going out for our big day at the NO JazzFest. I would definitely stay here again.
Beautiful Hotel situated in a great location. Only 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street or tram right outside the door.Staff were all very courteous and helpful. Room was absolutely beautiful. King Size Bed in a huge room, big bathroom. Rooms were immaculate and very, very comfortable.Drury Inn serve free drinks and nibblies late afternoon. We enjoyed this at the end of our day.Our highlight of New Orleans was doing the Katrina Bus Tour. It was 3 hours very well spent and would recommend this to anyone visiting as staying in Downtown you wouldn't realise that anything had happened.
Visited NOLA with a group of girl scouts and their parents. This hotel was a great base for our large group of 20+. The free breakfast, popcorn and drinks, and kick back made our trip even more economical. Free shuttle to the Mardi Gras museum from the hotel. Great outdoor pool the girls loved to splash around in after a long day of sight seeing. The elevators require roomkeys to access, which is an added security feature we appreciated. Excellent location from which to explore the French Quarter, catch a tram, and head out and about. Also, walking distance from the Amtrak station.
I had a king bedroom suite in the back corner of the 5th floor. The room was perfect. The bathroom had a lot of space and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and the dinner in the afternoon was also very yummy. The staff was very friendly and polite despite it being hectic due to Mardi Gras going on. I didn't use the parking but the hotel having it's own garage is a plus. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to not stay in the heart of the French Quarter.
Great hotel, very clean, good rates excellent value for the money. They offer free breakfast light evening meal. Rooms were huge with enormous ceilings! I had a room with 2 queens more than enough room. Location was good. I unfortunately had a walking boot on and that made getting around city difficult. Otherwise I wouldn't have had any issues with location. But having limited mobility the location was not the best. My only other issue with the hotel was even with being on 7th floor you still heard a lot of street traffic even at night since its on a major street. Would recommend the hotel just on its value alone.
I stayed at the Drury Inn checking in on July 4th and stayed 4 nights. This hotel is clean and well maintained. The people that work here ALL seem to be friendly and helpful. Check in was painless. I was able to check in early before noon. The breakfast is nice. They have more than the average hotel breakfast. Eggs, sausage, biscuits, Oatmeal, potatos, waffle makers along with the normal fruit, cold cereral, yogurt type items. The afternoon kick back food is nice. Hot dogs,, check tenders, etc. This hotel is perfect for a large family with lots of kids. You can save money with the free meals and drinks. The free drinks are nice, not a big selection alcohol wise. A few types of wine and beer, vodka, bloody marys, tonic water, orange juice is about the extent of the alcohol. Its free, so just go with the flow!! Popcorn and pop in the afternoon also. Our room was on the 8th floor facing Carondelet street and had a nice view. Not much street noise. Room had double beds and was nice. High ceilings and large windows. Comfy beds. No exhaust in the bathroom. Housekeeping met expectations. The hotel is on Poydras which is in the business district so you will have to walk to get to the action of Canal street and the French Quarter. French quarter was about 5 or 6 blocks straight up Carondelet. We walked it LATE at night/EARLY morning and had no problem. Didn't feel unsafe. Trolley car line is at the corner. Stadium is about 5 or 6 blocks up the street. They have 2 computers in the lobby with printers. I had no problems with them. Also an ATM. 3 ATM charge. Nice sitting area to relax in the lobby and downstairs. The location isn't THAT bad. If you want to see a lot, then there will be a lot of walking or trolley riding. Cabs are plentiful and the front desk will call you a cab which I recommend. Unless you are VERY picky, high class type and expect EVERY little thing to be perfect, just about anyone should like this hotel and be satisfied. Its not 5 star Sheraton fancy, but not a Motel 6.
This was our second time at this hotel. We found this to be a great place to stay. The beds were comfortable and nice linens. The room was immaculate, the complimentary breakfast was good and the 24/7 coffee and tea was appreciated. There was a great space to gather with friends that were also staying at the hotel. It is...

Staying here for couple weeks, it's a standard Hampton, clean, nothing exceptional. Some rooms have sofa area which is nice. Microwave and decent size mini fridge to grab a few things for the room.

The room was fine but the blue tape around my door was questioning but I did not have time to find out what was going on. The king size room I had, had enough space for a sofa bed. Plug attachment nice.
The room was clean and spacious, although a bit dated. The mattress was comfortable, but had food debris and stains under the mattress pad. The air conditioner was immediately adjacent to the bed and blew directly on the bed. There were outside balconies with no...More
You will not be disappointed here. The room we had was fabulous. These renovated mansions are gorgeous. The breakfast served the next day in the main mansion was delicious as well. Loved the shuttle that will take you around the area.The2ofUStogether, we are so glad that you enjoyed a fabulous stay at The Inn! Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us and the Trip Advisor community!
The night staff was super nice when Ichecked in late on the evening. Ouickly the staff addressed my needs. The room was very clean. The breakfast was hot, well stocked and presented in a timely manner.
I stayed at the motel this weekend - everything in the motel was in excellent condition very well decorated and comfortable. The employees were very friendly and well trained. It is in a excellent locations if you are in Atlanta for business downtown or for sports, etc. I didn't find anything to complain about and since I have been in... More

We stay at Hampton Inn a lot. This hotel was pretty much on par with most except for a couple drawbacks. The rooms are small - not a lot of extra space at all. The breakfast room is really cramped as well and there isn't a ton of seating although we didn't have an issue finding a table. The rooms were nice though and staff was helpful. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance, which is nice. Fortunately we didn't spend a lot of time in our room, so the cramped space wasn't an issue. I'd stay here again unless my travels required a larger room.Hello,Thanks for reviewing our property. We truly appreciate you rating our property 4 out of 5. We take great pride in providing excellent customer service. We hope the next time you visit Atlanta, you choose stay with us again. Thanks!
The location of this hotel was great ,wi wi restaurants literally across the street and Kroger's that was almost next too.we walked around and found some local bars ,if you're into that.Uber was available but we walked with no problems.Hello, Thanks for your review. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you again!
The hotel was clean and comfortable. The location was convenient to my business appointment and a relatively short drive from Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. There was a good selection of restaurants nearby.
Very modern and welcoming hotel. This will be my go to hotel when traveling to the greater ATL area. Staff was helpful and the location was perfect. Loved how clean and inviting my room was. Thank you
Great location near the airport. Ample, well lit parking. Excellent reception staff and valet park team. Large, modern rooms that are well appointed and modern. Very quiet and comfortable. Good food and good service in Martini's lounge restaurant.
You just have to read some of the other reviews for this place to realize that there are some major shortcomings in its management. Clearly not indicative of the Westin brand. We made the mistake of not researching the hotel before making a parking reservation after Christmas. Cutting to the chase, our car was broken into in the garage while we were away (as was the car parked next door). We arrived back late at night to find plastic taped over the window and glass everywhere. The security guard at the hotel showed us a police report and told us that two suspects were arrested, gave us the name and number of the GM and sent us on our way. It is now March - our calls to the GM have never been returned - voicemail every time. 297 out of pocket for replacing the glass in the passenger window plus the cost of items stolen, but we don't have a copy of the police report to pass along to our insurance agent because the hotel management appear not to give two craps about a) what happens at this property, and b) basic customer service. Do yourself a favor and find an alternative.On behalf of the hotel we apologize for the unfortunate incident with your car. You can obtain a copy of the police report by contacting the College Park Police Department at 404-761-3131.
Let me begin by accentuating the positive, check in staff and shuttle drivers are friendly and efficient. Room is dated but not dirty. Air didn't work properly. Lunch buffet although tasty is no where worth 22.00 for 2 meats , 2 vegetables and salad.pool and hot tub were gross. A dirty film covered the water. Hair was everywhere. Very dirty. Wait staff at the bar are rude . They act like you are bothering them to ask for service. This hotel is no where worth the they charge. Also watch your bill. They tried to charge me for items that I didn't buy. The Marriott just across the street is a much better option.On behalf of the entire hotel staff we appreciate you taking the time to write a review, Thank you for the nice comments on our staff. Our lunch prices are comparable to the other full service hotels in the market, We will have our engineers check the filtering system at the pool to see if there is an issue. We will address your comments about the service at the bar with the Food and Beverage Director.
The hotel restaurant/bar was the best part.We had a group and Brandii took great care of us while we were there for 2 nights in a row. She provided great service which made for a pair of enjoyable evening.Good day charn498, Thank you for providing your feedback from your recent visit to our hotel and Martini's lounge. We are delighted Brandi took such great care of you during your stay. We hope to welcome you again soon. Let's Rise! Amy Coulter
We only stayed here for one night as we transfer at the Atlanta airport. Hotel is a short drive from the airport and offers free shuttle. Service is great - my wife somehow didn't feel well (due to allergies) in the first room they offered us, and the staff was kind enough to arrange the presidential suite as an exchange since they were fully booked that night. Comfortable bed and quality sleep.
A perfect spot to catch a 6:00 AM shuttle to the airport...wake-up call was very efficient....we ate dinner in their restaurant and it was good, not great...it's a hotel restaurant...There's an old adage, that if there is a line around a free-standing restaurant, The food must be Great...If there is a line at a hotel restaurant, the service must not be goodGood day mlesser1,Thank you for staying with us and sharing your comments. We're delighted you enjoyed your stay and the convenience of the airport shuttle service.We hope to welcome you again soon.Be well.
You will not find a friendlier, accommodating staff than at The Partridge Inn.

Paper thin walls, can hear everything next door from them thinking to talking. Hallways hot(no air) and heat lamps in tiny elevator will have you sweat for sure. A/c units in rooms make too much noise

There are two La Quintas in Westminster and I've stayed in both. This one is better: cleaner, friendlier, and generally better run. Now that I've stayed at this one, I won't be returning to the other.
We stay at LaQuinta's regularly. This one fell below the others in three areas. The desk staff did not seem to be really up on things, the internet was extremely slow and disconnected frequently, and the blackout curtains were inefficient and couldn't compete with a light that was right outside our window.
I think the price for the rooms was overpriced. The room was not very clean for the and the exhaust fan in the bathroom was very loud. There is a refrigerator and microwave in the room. The refrigerator did keep the stuff cold.
Very good value. Clean room. Complimentary wifi , parking and breakfast. Great location - near highway, shopping, restaurants. Breakfast was adequate. Eating area was clean. Staff friendly and accommodating.
Not a bad place to stay on a budget, security is lacking as garage door to parking lot is open all day, anyone can enter thur elevator's. Continental breakfast is a plus. We had 2 Queen size bed's in our room they seemed more like double bed's
Staff always does an excellent job. The rooms are clean,location great as is the price for this area. No frills but very comfortable stay if thats what your looking for. I will recommend to friends and coworkers when in area.
I enjoyed my experience and would stay there again the locating was close to my business purpose and staff was polite and helpful. The breakfast was nice and my only complaint was I needed to wash my hands and didn't know where the washroom was located until the second day not complaints regarding anything additional. I will be staying there again in January.
Hampton Inn's are always a good choice when travelling for business, this however was not a business trip. As usual the value for the dollar is high here, but for me one of the best things was the ability to park UNDER the hotel in an enclosed parking facility. You don't often find THAT in a reasonably priced hotel. Highly recommended.
One of the nicest and friendliest Hampton's I have experienced. As a business traveler I value ease of access, location, cleanliness, efficient staff and good internet. Was not disappointed. About an 80 ride from San Diego Airport on Uber.
Staff was courteous helpful and friendly. Great location however would not stay there again. Complimentary breakfast was good. Free parking. Rooms are clean but in need of updating. Beds are not comfortable at all. Thank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and we sincerely apologize for the bedding issues that you experienced during your stay. We will be sure to take your comments about our property under consideration as we re-evaluate guest needs and continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you to our area.Thanks again,Hotel Management
Stayed there for a family trip. We had in mind to visit main attractions of SD area with kid, so staying in Hampton Inn made sense, equally close to SD ZOO and Sea World and to Lego Land. The complimentary breakfast was pretty good and saved us time in the morning(vs searching for breakfast place at some other location) Pool is outside and was too cold to use (wasn't that hot of a weather so). Clean rooms, kudos to housekeeping team.
I was recommended this property from a friend who works in the hospitality industry. We came in for my friend's birthday and the room was extremely spacious. The property was easy to find and perfectly located just a short Uber ride from the beach and the restaurants in the area. We came specifically for the pool, which was a little smaller than we were expecting but it was still nice to be able to enjoy it when it was fairly hot outside (like 80 degrees but I'm a baby about heat). We would definitely stay again.
We extended our stay in CA after a convention event and happened across the Del Mar Hampton. Close enough to the beach for easy access without getting ripped off by the coastal rates and within a short distance of Torrey Pines, Del Mar, Solona Beach and all of the shops and restaurant you could want. Staff-awesome service and help for all our travel needs
Del Mar Hampton Inn is 15 minutes from both Camp Pendleton and USMC Miramar where my conferences are held. Perfect location right on I-5. Great hotel. The hotel is very clean and staff go out of their way to help with anything. The breaksfast are nice, but the coffee is great. Overall this is one of my favorite Hampton Inns to stay at.
This is a great hotel. Nicely placed off the I-5. Restaurant in the front yard, Am/PM/Taco Bell in the backyard. Always clean. Nice breakfast. Nice workout room. Pet-friendly. We had a room with a very uncomfortable bed. Very strange for this place. Oh well. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone going to SD with pets or kids for that matter. You will love it
Good quiet location, close but not to close to the track and the beach. Close to the freeway and good restaurants. Quality hotel for the price in Del Mar. Helpful staff. Clean room, clean pool, clean sheets.
My wife and I love to stay at Hampton Inn because we know what to expect every time and for us that's a good thing. The only reason that I don't give it a 5 star review is that this location does not have fresh cookies. Only the Hampton's that have fresh cookies get a 5 star. Given that our stay included one of San Diego's wettest and coldest May day's in the past 100 years, we definitely enjoyed being able to park for free in the parking garage. It's the little things.
One night staff theaten to call police and lock the doors as one our members (coach was in the sitting area with a player). He was rude and could of spoke to the guests in a polite manner before giving the rude ultimatum as there was a loud party not from our group making noise the night before. Rooms has a old smell and I had to spray the pillows and sheets with frebreeze. Housekeeping missed cleaning our room one day as they said we refused cleaning, I asked all the guest in the room and they said this never happened. Also housekeeping was performed very late in many of our groups rooms. Perhaps more cleaning staff is needed during the busy Albion cup weekend. The internet needs faster speed, perhaps this is the way Hampton makes money if guest are frustrated with the complimentary internet.Rooms should have 2 queen beds instead of 2 double beds as they are very small for 4 adults. I used the coffee maker/fridge/microwave, happy they were available but they could use upgrading.The pool was cool and there was no hot tub. It would also be benificial to have laundry on site- even if we have to pay for it. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to future guest on TripadvisorThank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and we sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced during your stay. We will be sure to take your comments about our property under consideration as we re-evaluate guest needs and continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you to our area.Thank you,Hotel Management
Very nice Hampton Inn as always. Very nice staffs, they will help you with directions, things to do around town. I had a good experience while I stayed here for close to two months. Close to highway and shopping centers.
Hotel is just off Hwy 5. Visited UC-San Diego. Close to many shops and eating places. Used the fitness center. Room is large and clean. Breakfast has many good choices (eggs, waffles, bacon, cereal, croissants).
Staff here are Awesome! I was in a desparate need to find a place to stay last minute that was pet friendly. The hotel was easily accessable, the staff were wonderful, the room was clean, pleasant smelling and the linin was soft. The bed was great, too. Complimentary breakfast was the cherry on top! Definitely stay here if you can.
Stayed here for a week on vacation. Very nice hotel, quite clean. Easy access to almost anything you want to visit. Fairly quiet, some noise as it isn't too far off the highway. Had no trouble finding it. Breakfast area was one of the nicest we've seen and the service at breakfast was great, everything kept full and clean. Only negatives of our stay were they don't have any laundry facilities and if you request a refrigerator, they charge 10 a day. Would definitely stay here again.
I came to town for a conference. Although I wasn't super close to the event (due to last minute planning and lots of local events going on that week) I was completely satisfied. Initially, I was so upset to find that the Hilton was booked and my travel agent was trying to sell me on the Hampton Inn. I was forced to take this room. And after all the whining and complaining, I ended up loving it. I came in very late after visiting friends in LA. it seemed very SECLUDED, dark and a little scary. But once I got to the hotel I realized it was clean, up to date, stylish, trendy and the staff was extremely nice and accommodating. I was able to earn Hilton Honor rewards points. The breakfast was FREE and actually pretty good. Housekeeping was thorough and kept my room well stocked. While staying there for 4 days, I've came across several staff members, all just as nice, and helpful as the next. I would say I received just as good of service and the room was just about as nice as the Hilton Pasadena that I had just spent the previous nights at. But with this hotel i paid slightly less, i didn't have to pay for parking (but missed the valet) and did I say FREE breakfast. No stale donuts. I'm talking fresh pastries, hot and cold cereal, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffle maker, fresh fruit and assorted juices and more. AMAZING! I would stay here again if I had to come back.
I have very few requirements for a good hotel stay, and the Hampton met them all. It was impeccably clean, had a very comfortable bed, and was reasonably priced. I was in town for a couple of days and the staff helped make my stay a pleasant one.
My wife and I stayed here while visiting the Del Mar Fairgrounds. My wife liked it a lot, but I had some hesitations. The room did not have a mini-refrigerator which I thought all Hampton Inns had. If you are expecting a mini-frig, be sure and request it when making your reservations. The furniture and room colors were drab and boring, and could use upgrading or wall paper. The beds were very good. The flat screen t.v. was nice, but no HD channels, and in fact, only about a dozen channels. Could use Discovery and Fox Sports San Diego. The breakfast room downstairs is very big with a good breakfast, (although I would have liked some donuts or something sweet!). I thought the towels were very thin, and could use upgrading. There were no flyers/brochures of local attractions like all hotels have now days. I thought the Hampton Inn-Kearney Mesa was better. But, this hotel was VERY QUIET, considering all the people staying there during the fair! That was a major plus.
This Hampton seemed to be just off the beaten path of tourists and their traps :) good price, excellent breakfast, and loved the short walk to Tio Leo's for a delicious dinner the night we arrived in Del Mar.
Shuttle only available if someone working at the time can drive it, which was never over 4 days there. Restaurant nearby is a Taco Bell in the parking lot. When spoke with front desk about problems, I was simply told the staff would be talked to, no effort to make up for poor service and misrepresentation.Dear lssnoopy2, Thank you for your review. Were sorry we didnt provide the quality of amenities and service you deserved during your recent stay at our hotel. We apologize for the issues with shuttle service availability, and we are working with our team to ensure these situations dont happen again. Your feedback is genuinely appreciated as it is the first step in helping us improve our services. If you return to our area, we hope youll stay with us again.
This was my first experience of a Hampton Inn. Check in was easy and efficient. Some of the staff were more easy going than others but overall they conducted themselves professionally and courteously. My room was a King studio. The bed was super comfortable for me. Space was adequate as a solo traveller attending a conference. The breakfast was good and varied over the 5 days I was there. Wifi was solid and quick. I had a car and was able to park underneath the hotel. Parking spaces were good. Parking was secured after 7pm. There is a local Taco Bell and petrol station nearby. There is a Vons and other shops down the road about 3 minutes. The views of the freeway was uninspiring but the noise was not intrusive. Overall, I had a good stay and if in the area again, I would be happy to stay here again.
This is a very nice hotel that is reasonably priced and in a safe area for walking as well as shopping. Good access to Interstate 5 and not far to drive to the beaches. Staff are personable and helpful. The breakfast area is clean and well tended. For the overall price, the free breakfast is adequate.
Staff is very nice and responsive. Parking is both outside and below the building (so that it's locked at night). Excellent proximity to the I-5, and in a minute or two you are to Del Mar Heights Road, or in the other direction in a little longer you are to La Jolla Villa drive. Rooms are pleasant and well tended. Overall, a positive experience, though breakfast is not up to the standard of say, the Homewood Suites.
Typical Hampton. Better than average room - clean, comfortable furnished well, and quiet. Less than average breakfast - I stay in Hamptons all the time and this might be my LEAST favorite breakfast ever (EXACT same choices two days in a row, no granola for the yogurt, less than usual number of bread options). Average staff. Better than average cleanliness in public areas. Finally, while the location itself is great and very central for many Torrey Pines/La Jolla businesses and even beaches, it was difficult to actually get to the property (dead ends, one way streets and crossing highways with entrances and exits make the intersection a trick to navigate).
Breakfast need to be improve service is not bad rooms kinda smells like wet rag overall is clean not enough tables n chairs in the lounge good air conditioning the price is not too bad for a peak summer
Location was great next to the Interstate, and I had a wonderful view of the Taco Bell in the parking lot, but the bed was not great. Pillows were flat, bed was hard, and I woke up in pain every morning. On a positive note, breakfast was free and had a nice variety.
This is not a beach hotel but it is close to track, fairgrounds, business area and beaches.There was no additional parking fee. The waffles are great and internet is free and easy to access. Would stay here again.
An average Hampton Inn. However short on parking. (don't get there late at night) and poor wifi in rooms. (good in hallway and lobby) Great location for access to 5 fwy and Del Mar race track. Short drive to great beaches but definitely a drive, not a walk.
Motel is nothing special, just typical of what you would expect from a freeway close place to stay. Staff was very friendly and provided several items that we forgot, free of charge. No views but easy on easy off of I-5 and great location for all local attractions especially Del Mar racetrack.
Great location. Reasonable price. Plenty of food choices for breakfast but very crowded breakfast area, but it was a Saturday. Clean and comfortable rooms. The wi-fi was descent. Would stay here again if in town.
Looking for a place to stay close to Old Town district. Hampton is on the outskirts of district. Clean as expected. Very nice reception area perfect for conversations. Staff was understaffed. Only 1 person there usually. Business center is open with no privacy...i needed more private area. People were walking through area as its in a hallway...almost like it was an afterthought. Laundry was useful. Breakfast was available for 15. Disappointing since all other Hamptons have included Breakfast. Overall nice place to drive to Old Town. Should try Freds for Mexican food!
There are several other hotels within a short distance of the HH Inn, but I have been happy coming here about twenty years to visit my kids nearby, earlier with my wife. It's convenient when I drove down from the Bay area and convenient to the S.D. downtown.
Rude staff. Staff had no clue about restaurants or nearby amenities. They were clueless. Room Was on first floor by parking lot and loud. Heater was also loud. Paid 160/nt. Not worth it. It does have underground free parking.
the hotel was clean and updated. Staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was awesome and well attended...the lady tending it was very approachable. There were 2 down sides and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.....one was there wasn't a lot of dinner choices nearby....only a Taco Bell and a Mexican restaurant plus an am/pm convenience store and 2 the a/c in our room smelled like dirty socks or shoes, which I told the front desk when I checked out. Other than those 2 things...the place is great and affordable!
Had a wonderful time staying at a quality hotel. The secure free parking was very nice and the free breakfast every morning was outstanding. A lot of fun and very convenient. Great location and close to the beach.
Breakfast was really good, there's a lot of choices. Staff are helpful for a special request. Convenient location to tour San Diego if you have a car. Garage is gated. The pool though is outside near the street.
Stayed just for a night on a quick business trip to San Diego. I like staying in the Del Mar area, since it's usually cheaper than downtown or Hotel Circle, and traffic usually not an issue getting in or out of the city. Plus there's easy access to Hwy 101 and all the beach communities. This is a standard Hampton Inn which means good quality, nice comfortable room and bed, nice lobby, etc. The wifi doesn't reach to the upper floors, which i like to stay in. Not a problem, as they have a hard wired connection in the room that was fine. Very clean place, didn't hear neighboors. It's very close to both I-5 and CA 56 bypass, but I didn't hear the highways as long as I had the fan/ac unit on. My only thing to comment negatively on was the water in the room out of the bathroom sink tasted terrible -- really loaded with chemicals that made me nauseous, even from just brushing my teeth. Of all the reviews I've done here on T.A. around the country, I've never noted this before and it was so strong and noticeable I had to mention it.
Booked one night for Sunday Memorial Day weekend, we found the lowest rate 110/night for holiday weekend compared to surrounding comparable hotels. The Cons: Hotel is oddly located behind the Residence Inn, across from the Doubletree, right next to the 56 freeway, gas station and Taco Bell, very small workout room and pool. The Pros: The outside appears bland but clean, the large inside lobby has a very relaxing welcoming set up, plenty of comfortable nice looking furniture seating areas, with roomy space and layout. Free Coffee and tea available all day in the lounge/breakfast area. Professional, welcoming customer service at check in and out, we were allowed to check in early about 0100. The included breakfast was very good, fresh and plenty of nice choices, great deal to be included in the nightly rate. There was eggs with ham, thick potato wedges, fresh fruit, tasty breads/muffins, fresh oatmeal, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee, tea. Our room was roomy/clean, the ac worked well, bed felt great, nice linen/towels, freeway noise not too loud, good internet connection included. Free parking available in their lot and underground parking also. Within 15-20 mins. to La Jolla and downtown San Diego, very close to beaches. We were very happy and impressed with the service, our room, the hotel's large welcoming lobby setup, the wonderful breakfast, the great rate and relative proximity to other San Diego locations. We will definitely recommend and return to this Hampton.
My stay at this hotel was great! The room was clean, the king bed was so comfortable, and the breakfast options were on-point! The staff was very friendly and helpful answering any questions I had. The breakfast options varied with options each day (which is good)! And, this may sound strange, but the hallways smelled so fragrant. This shows that they maintain their appearance and uphold a clean standard (which is very important)! Overall, here are a few reasons why I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area: 1- friendly staff 2- very clean and well, maintained rooms AND building 3- FREE parking!!!! 4- breakfast is plentiful Enjoy!
Stayed at this hotel from September 27 - 29 and were more than pleasantly surprised by all that it offers. We booked a one bedroom suite which is unusual for a Hampton property, but really enjoyed the spacious room and all that it offers. Room had separate living and bedroom areas, a wet bar in the living room, and two bathrooms. The condition of the room was great, with everything very clean and well maintained. The hotel also has underground parking with elevator access to each floor, a really nice convenience. The complimentary breakfast was very good both days and was well stocked despite being quite busy. We were somewhat concerned about being 15 miles from downtown as we were in San Diego for a concert, but were pleased that the location is actually very accessible and is only 20 minutes from Petco Park and the harbour area. Would certainly stay at this hotel again and recommend this to others.
Nice clean quiet hotel. Free Wi-Fi, Free Parking, a wonderful free breakfast with delicious hot waffles, eggs, bacon, fresh fruit, selection of juices, cereals, coffees, teas, yogurts, oatmeal, pastries, etc. Pool area austere, basic rectangle surrounded by little more than fencing, much like swimming in a cage. There is no hot tub which was a disappointment.
Great service! Tasty breakfast! Great management ! Nice parking underneath the hotel room with cover, no need to worry about weather condition. Clean room! Free internet service! Quiet room to get good quality sleep!
We had a wonderful experience at the San Diego Hampton Inn. The complimentary breakfast was the best we've ever had at any hotel. The Hampton was clean, quiet and the staff was outstanding! The location was great and the other accommodations such as complementery Wi-Fi, microwave, refrigerator, fitness center, etc. were certainly appreciated. The front desk staff, the cleaning staff and those who provided the great food were extremely pleasant.
This Hampton is clean and fresh. Newer decor. Nice location near the 5 freeway but there is No noticeable freeway noise. Staff is freindly and efficient Highly recommend for a reliable no frills location in Del Mar.
Bad eggs for breakfast (they tasted more like mashed potatoes not eggs) / Not able to take a bath due to drain not working to hold up the water.. On either issue, staff did not really feel like it was of any concern.... :(Thank you for sharing this quick feedback on your recent stay with us via TripAdvisor. We appreciate your honest input on the comfort of our rooms and breakfast offerings and we will keep your comments in mind as we constantly look for new ways to improve our guests' experience. We hope you will return to stay with us the next time you are in town and let us know how we are doing. Thank you,Hampton Inn San/Diego/Del Mar Management Team
First impressions mean a lot. The front desk staff at this hotel are great and go out of their way to do anything they can to provide you with a pleasant stay. Free covered parking and a great location just off I-5 was a big plus. The free high-speed internet and breakfast are nice. The rooms are large, comfortable and quiet. When I return to the San Diego area, I will be staying here.
Careful when you book this place, especially if you book via a third party! We booked and supposedly paid for the hotel when we booked it, yet we had money taken when we checked out. I have since been informed by the company that I booked it through that this is a non refundable hotel and therefore we had already paid! so we now have to claim a refund from Hampton Inn for charging us twice! Not a comfortable nights sleep, pillows were terrible, WIFI was in and out, staff were unhelpful and so on. Simple sum up here, stay somewhere else!Thank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and were very sorry for negative experience at our hotel. If you would like to discuss these issues in more detail, please contact us at the information below. We look forward to hearing back from you soon. Hotel Management(858) 792-5557SANDLHamptonHilton.com
Another fine Hampton Inn. Clean and well maintained property. Friendly staff and free parking. Great breakfast selection. Quiet room for location near interstate. A number of good restaurants about one mile north of hotel. Will stay here again!
If driving to this hotel, be aware that this hotel is tucked behind a gas station. The weekend was quite busy and it was spring break. Breakfast got pretty crowded but th s is expected for such. Great value hotter. It was clean, I tell ya! My favorite part.
We had a very nice suite that was well equipped, cozy, and comfy. We were actually pleasantly surprised. Suite deserves 5 stars.Minus 1 star for front desk attitude about late checkout. I was refused until I pulled the status card. Breakfast is a typical Hampton zoo and if you want something better just walk over to Marriott for real breakfast.
The staff at Hampton Inn was helpful and expedient! What a refreshing change from my typical travel experience. I do a lot of business travel and felt well taken care of at this San Diego Hampton Inn. For me, a quick check-in after traveling is very important and the staff was quick and sharp.
Please avoid this hotel. After Hampton Inn lost our reservation, Lilana was the rudest customer service employee I have encountered in a very long time. I frequently stay at Hampton Inn and was shocked at the treatment I received. The smallest amount of courtesy would have solved my problem without incident. I have never posted a review, but wanted everyone to be spared a similar experience.Thank you for your review. Please accept my sincere apologies for the poor level of service that you received this is not the Hampton norm as our goal is Satisfaction Guaranteed. I have addressed these issues with our staff, and hope that the next time you are in the area you will come stay with us again and experience an improved level of customer service. Hotel General Manager
Good hotel if you have business in the area. Not as convenient to all the tourist attractions other than UCSD. Overall, facility is clean and well kept. Due to my work I have only been able to enjoy the breakfast once, but I recall they have a very nice breakfast. I don't recall if they have the to-go breakfasts anymore.
Stayed here for business. Super comfortable bed and always available complimentary coffee. In room fridge, and good Mexican place within walking distance. Several other places within a mile. The eggs weren't the best at breakfast, but Great diner (Snooze) just up the street.
Hotel has a great location, just a few minutes away from the beach. The hotel staff was professional and friendly and the complimentary breakfast was excellent. I also liked the new service of a digital room key - was able to open the door from an ap on my phone, super convenient.
This Hampton Inn is well maintained and in a good location. The rooms are typical Hampton rooms. Good size and very clean. The staff was friendly and available. The breakfast was a bit of a mad house and seemed sparse.
I have no negative things to say about this hotel. The hotel is above average in all aspects. Loved to gated and secure parking garage. The hotel appears to have recently gone through an update due to modern touches everywhere. There is a beautiful beach less then two miles away with a national park that also has great hiking.
Very pet friendly, breakfast was excellent, nice variety. Coffee and hot chocolate, available all day. My only con , well actual 2. Beds are small, but comfortable. the bathroom area is not ADA, no grab bars around toilet. However, I learned years ago to purchase suction grabs , such in case hotel don't have them.. Staff were friendly, maid service was, good , however, spent all my 5's, on the airport getting there. Be sure, and save out money to tip the maids.
While on business travel, not sure why people need to pay outrageous prices to stay at a high end hotel. You end up paying for internet AND parking which raises the prices even higher. Your only in your room to sleep most of the time.This was an excellent hotel and as far as cleanliness, customer service and additional services... this compares to many of the higher end hotels I have stayed at. The rooms were just newly renovated to brand new and clean. Fridge, microwave, large TV and comfortable bed and free internet (fast too).Free breakfast (lots of choices) and free garage parking. Right across the parking lot is a gas station with fast food and lots of snacks and beverages for those late night needs.Simply excellent.
The location to most areas of San Diego and it's surroundings made this location perfect for our needs. It's right off the I-5 which puts you close to all attractions in that corridor. It has a gated parking area with an elevator from the garage to the room floors.
The bed was very comfortable. Also nice to have a fridge and microwave. Most features of the room are upgraded except heating at cooling couldn's adjust to a comfortable temperature. Free parking however the garage is very small and there were not enough spots on the lot and garage to accomodate all guest. Bathtub was stained which was not a good look but other than that, the room was clean. The staff could have been alot more friendly and helpful.
Enjoyed staying at this location.Rooms were very comfortable and large.Location was easy to get to all attractions.Breakfast had a great variety of selections. Parking was easy accessd.Good location for handicap parking.
We just spent the night and had a reasonably good stay. The location is outstanding as you are near a number of destinations such as the Del Mar Racetrack. The rooms are typical of Hampton Inn not large but large enough for a short stay.Our only complaint is the refrigeration system. They are wall mounted and hard to adjust to get the correct temp. Additionally, they are very noisy and when the compressor kicked in it got noisier. They need a central system.
We stayed at this hotel the night before my son's wedding. The bride's family stayed there too. It was clean, had a great breakfast and very helpful staff. We reserved two rooms and were given rooms next to each. That was nice. The brides family was just down the hall. I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when I go back to San Diego. The price was great too!
This is a very good hotel to stay at, everything was excellent. We only had 2 somewhat complaints although it wouldnt stop us from coming back...parking is very limited, you might have to find a place unprotected to park and the internet is not even worth using
The hotel is new and clean. The parking is self park and free. The breakfast is good. The rooms were a bit long and narrow, but everything was clean. Just don't think you are going to hang by the pool as it's the size of my bathtub.
There was definitely an issue with the bathroom exhaust fan system as we had a bad stench of sewer gas in our bathroom for the three days we were there. We asked at the desk and all they did was spray which worked for about 20 minutes then the stench returned. Should have offered us another room.
While visiting our son for the Thanksgiving holiday, we enjoyed many local activities. We hiked Torrey Pines, visited the UCSD campus, Birch Aquarium, and the San Diego Zoo. We were sure to make the breakfast a part of every day. The airport is very close too! Perfect for our vacation!
My sister I stayed at the Del Mar Hampton Inn using Hilton Honors points when my husband had surgery last week. We were worn out so were pleased at the ease of checked in helpful recommendations for places to eat. Our room was small, but had everything we needed was comfortable very clean. Our breakfast was a treat from hospital food. They were very gracious about assuring us a full refund of unused points when we checked out 2 days early due to my husband's early release from the hospital. It was a great experience during a stressful time.
My room was perfect, very clean and accommodating. I will definitely consider this hotel again. The breakfast was great each morning with fresh fruit and coffee. You can make a waffle and they even had fresh blueberries. My room had fresh clean linen and all was perfectly clean. My room was quiet and clean as well as the rest of the hotel. The staff was very accommodating.
This was our first Hampton Inn, landed late in San Diego, 17 miles north. great room, fantastic breakfast, did exactly what it said on the tin. Our only problem was getting to it, needed better signs from freeway. Underground parking a real advantage for tired traveller. Will stay again.
Second time at this location very clean, friendly staff and near the I-5. Parking not a problem, this hotel has a ground garage. It's nice not to worry about you car. Breakfast is included, make your own waffle station. Oatmeal, eggs, pastries, fruit, yogurt and cereal. Coffee, juice, milk and hot chocolate.
I just spent a week long business trip in the San Diego area. Staying at the Hampton Inn was a pleasure. It's located a bit north of the city with easy access to the highway network without traffic noise disturbing your sleep or concentration while working in the evenings. The hotel serves an excellent breakfast and there are a couple good restaurants in walking distance for the evening meal and many others a short drive away. While this is not close to the downtown attractions that would bring me here on vacation, (i.e., Old Town, Gas Lamp District and the Waterfront) it is the ideal location for business travelers or meetings as long as you have transportation. I had a meeting on the south side of town this morning, approx 26 miles away. It took about 30-45 minutes to get there, which is not a problem if you plan properly. I have another in the morning and I'm not concerned about making it on time.I will be attending a conference in San Diego during February and I will definitely be staying here again.
Had a wonderful stay as always - very comfortable bed and super clean. Service was top-notch as expected and usual. I didn't have breakfast but it looked appealing and a wide variety to choose. Area was clean and well stocked.
This hotel is located near the business area outside san diego city centre. It has a good spacious room, free wifi, and free snack and drinks for HHonor hilton member. Price is highly competitive and room is clean.
I enjoyed my stay there. The room was clean no problem. The location was ok having access to the highway and local surrounding business when you need things. The staff showed hospiliality during our stay. I enjoyed the breakfast .
We stayed here to have easy access to Del Mar, La Jolla and San Diego. We were able to get to all places of interest on demand with no problems. The staff at this hotel is friendly and very good at providing the best service. Our room was clean that the carpet appeared new. We were able to park in the underground garage and take the elevator to our room. Overall, it was a safe, comfortable and pleasant experience.
I always enjoy this hotel for my overnight stay before my flt home and my first night of vacation before I drive up to see my family the next day. I arrive at midnight and there is never any stress w ck in and always s good breakfast in the am. Easy access to freeway, coming or going.
If you are just looking for a cheaper hotel in Del Mar, this may even be a fair choice, if you don't mind very dirty rooms, no parking spaces if you arrive after 10 PM, scant breakfast if you get it after 8:30 AM and practically unresistant concierge service.
The hotel was extremely clean and well located. The staff went out of their way to be sure everything was perfect. The morning breakfast was quite good as well. making it the perfect start to a great day. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone needing a place to stay in the area.
I stay at this Hampton Inn routinely the personnel are exceptional - desk, housekeeping, breakfast prep, etc. Rooms are always clean, quiet, comfortable. There are many other hotel choices in the area but whenever I'm in the area (sometimes monthly on business) I always stay here.
I was disappointed about the Hampton Inn Del Mar. My preferences as Hilton Honors member were ignored. The room we were given overlooked a Taco Bell and the freeway. Needless to say the noise level was great. The front desk staff simply did not care about our satisfaction. The lamps did not work. I have stayed at Hampton Inns before and have been satisfied but this was not the case with this hotel. On a positive note the breakfasts were pretty good.Thank you for your review. We highly appreciate your feedback and sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced during your stay. We will be sure to take your comments about our property under consideration as we re-evaluate guest needs and continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you to our area.Thanks again,Hotel Management
Good location no views whatsoever but the staff we incredible. I was particularity impressed with Josh at the front desk. We needed a tad more space since we were traveling with my young daughter and he went out of his way to accommodate. The Breakfasts each morning were wonderful with friendly attentive staff.
Beware there is limited space for have breakfast in the morning, so get there early. Watch where you park, some guest may have just walked their dog. Hope the people above you know how to be respectful of those below, elephants above make a lot of noise. If you happen to visit on a day that may involve children you may want to pick another hotel, we could hear virtually everything going on around us. We have stayed at Hampton's before and this is why we have stopped visiting. We try to visit Homewood's as their rooms are almost sound proof. We once stayed in a Homewood with a family of seven next door (children teenagers) and we never knew there was anyone even next door. At this property, we could hear the parents, next door, telling their kids to go to sleep, as if it was on the tv we were watching.I sincerely apologize for the noise you encountered from other guests during your stay. Our guests comfort and safety is my number one concern and I apologize that your comfort was interrupted. Your review will assist in correcting issues in the future. I do hope that the next time you are in the area you will consider staying at our property again. Thank you.Kind Regards,Hotel Management
Pros: 1) Clean and decent rooms 2) Supportive staff 3) Good and healthy breakfast 4) Nice swimming pool 5) 24 hrs Internet connection 6) Nice location (You will find lot of restaurants, grocery stores near by - walkable distance) Cons: 1) Coin Laundry is missing 2) Internet connection needs to be reset with your checked-in room credentials every 24 hrs. This will be a painful if your connection gets disconnected in between the meetings as part of 24 hrs duration.
Very please with the service and the cleanliness of the hotel. I wish the breakfast items had more bacon! ) The parking spaces in the garage are very tight however it is nice and secure with a gated entrance. They say that breakfast starts at 6 AM however the wonderful people would always have coffee out about 5 AM which was nice because I had to leave early for work
Always like the Hampton Inn for their great service and the free breakfast. The location is great close to the highway but not noisy. We got a room on the fourth floor, with clean and comfortable beds. Over the weekend the breakfast room got a little crowded, but there is still space in the lobby to sit down. Great to find parking space either in the garage or outside, they pointed out to us that they even offer Hilton Diamond member parking. The fitness room is small, but enough for your daily cardio. We definitely would come back if we need a place in Del Mar.
The room was very small, no room to relax at all. The beds were too small, the hotel only offered double beds A king or Queen bed was not even on the menu If you don't mind feeling like a sardine - check in !!
From the minute we walked into the lobby we knew we made the right decision. The staff, the room, the amenities, and the location were all perfect for us. Would highly reccomend for a couple or a famliy.
My husband and I had a comfortable stay at the Hampton Inn. The onsite restaurant served delicious appetizers. The room was clean, the size was comfortable and met our needs. The site includes an relaxing outdoor seating area to accommodate large groups of guests. The hotel is located in a nice, quiet area. However, don't expect shopping or restaurants within walking distance. Shuttle and taxi service was very prompt. Customer service was outstanding.
We were here for a family vacation during the summer. The customer service in this hotel was poor as well as the air conditioning unit was dated and did not work properly. The hallways were not air conditioned and it was hot. The bathroom tub had cracks in it.We are sorry we were not able to provide you with a better quality of service. This is not typical of our usual Hamptonality and welcoming staff, and we are always looking for ways to improve our customer experience. We'd also like to apologize for the malfunctioning air conditioner in your guest suite and have reported the issue to our maintenance team. Thank you for your feedback and we hope you will come back and stay with us again soon.
The Hotel is perfectly positioned between LEGOLAND , San Diego , lots of great beaches close by. Nice rooms , great new updated facility , great free parking around facility and underneath parking garage . Breakfast standard Hampton Breakfast with something for everybody .Vons Grocery store as well as Restaurants close by .
New facility presents great value. Very reasonably priced and easy to access business in La Jolla. Preferred to stay here compared to Embassy Suites - La Jolla and the Hilton Torrey Pines. Would certainly return here - in a moment.
Access to this hotel is easy as it is just off the freeway. The lobby and the rooms are clean and tastefully furnished. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast is excellent and there are many items to choose from. A great stay overall.
I was here for a Scripps visit. This was the best hotel. Free Parking! Free breakfast! Clean room! Easy on easy off I-5. And very close to shopping. We were able to find 2 excellent restuarants close by.
This hotel is clean, quiet and it does its job: a good room to sleep. The room has no fridge or a safe, which is surprising for this type of hotel. The breakfast was so so (horrible eggs, but nice DUI waffle).
We were here for an early dinner before starting a tour, and the restaurant was not busy. Very modern looking, and the food was good, but nothing exceptional. I don't think I'd make it a destination for eating, however.Dear Lipadad,Thank you for sharing your experience at 750 Restaurant. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed the food but are disappointed we did not WOW you during your dinner. We appreciate your feedback as we look to make future improvements. We hope to welcome you back again in the near future.Megan B., Guest Relations
This is a review of the customer service that I experienced at the Hilton. You would certainly expect better customer service from a 4-star hotel. After booking, I immediately reviewed the information and noticed the date was incorrect. So I called them to make the necessary correction. Apparently, it routed to a different date because the preselected date was not available (that's what the agent told me). They would not give me a refund, allow me to change my date, or even a credit to be applied to future reservations (not even a partial credit!). Now I'm stuck with a reservation that I can't even use. Thus, this review will only be limited to the customer service as I won't be able to use the reservation to enjoy the room. After this experience, I'm boycotting the Hilton. It's unfortunate as I always choose the Hilton above other hotels. No longer a fan!We thank you for submitting a guest survey. It is very unfortunate that you booked a non-refundable/non-modifiable reservation online. This review, while being pointed at our hotel as the one providing poor service, highlights the drawback with booking these type of reservations online. Hilton urges guests to book reservations through our websites. While these other internet booking sites offer a significant discount, the reservations mostly are not guaranteed a specific room type (king or double) and, most importantly, the reservations are not modifiable and cannot be canceled. This is clearly stated through the website that you booked on. Please use Hilton.com to book your stay. With our reservations, we have the flexibility to assist you when reservations need to be modified.
Basic hotel that could use a good cleaning and updating, but cheaper rates then the chain hotels. Nicely located in Chinatown beside the adult entertainment clubs and crazy Chinese singing karaoke or something late at night. Plus side was free parking in a cramped lot.
This place is legit. It's definitely not the Marriott or Ritz Carlton but whenever you book this hotel the rate will likely be much lower than most others. If you're coming to the city to hang out in the hotel room then don't stay here....if you need a clean and safe place to sleep and cleanup at then this is the place for you. Free parking and an unbeatable location.Definitely get a room in the back of the hotel. Rooms are small but not claustrophobic. 15 min walk to Union Square. Located by several fantastic shops and restaurants.
We were looking for a place to stay in San Francisco for the family (3 kids) and found Royal Pacific Motor Inn on hotels.com. I compared the price at hotels.com with the price if I were to book directly at the hotel on their own web-site. The price was almost the same (156 USD + tax, total 186 USD incl. tax), but I made the booking through hotels.com because there it was clear that we could stay 5 people in the room (often there is a limit of four persons which makes it a bit difficult if you have three children). At check out time they wanted to charge me 215 USD per night incl tax, that is almost 30 USD extra per night. They refused to acknowledge that my price was given including tax. So they have charged me two times for the tax.This is a kind of discussion you don't want to end up with during a vacation so make sure you have a correct quote if staying here. Otherwise the hotel was OK.
I have nothing to say against this accommodation. It was clean, it has great location and parking was also provided. WIFI in the room, comfortable bed, kind staff and they also have a room under supervision for your luggage at the day when you need to leave the room, but have a lot of time before you need to leave the city. Anyway, we were there just for sleep (who would stay in the hotel room when you are in SF!) and our sleep was without disturbance, so we (me - 23 my mum - 55) were totally satisfied :)
I looked all over the Internet for a reasonably priced hotel in or near down town San Francisco. The Royal Pacific motor inn fit the bill. We were pleased all the way are undo and free parking topped it off.
We checked in this Inn for a weekend stay. We are very satisfied. I was worry at the beginning but after we stayed for a night, I was happy to say I was worry free. This is in the center of Chinatown, which is a prime location of San Francisco. Its very easy to access to banks, restaurants, Walgreens. Furniture are not new, there is no flat screen TV. But we were outside most of the time so its ok. We can walk from here to Fisherman Wharf (around 30 mins). The bonus is, parking is free. So we saved for parking.
Stayed here for 6 days for my Son's Wedding. The room was clean, the beds comfortable, and the staff (especially LuLu) were great! Breakfast and Dinner in the restaurant were good. I would highly recommend staying at this Hotel.
Somewhat bare bones, but it had one queen bed, very comfortable, TV, small table and chairs, luggage rack, nice tub and shower, really, a great bargain! No fridge or microwave, but there was free coffee in the office. Quiet and clean.
I needed a no frills place to sleep during the day and wifi internet while I was working in Denver overnight.I though a large chain would be a safe bet. I talked with the person working the desk and she let me check in early (12 noon instead of 3pm) and I thought I was off to a good start,... More
My spouse I have repeatedly stayed in this hotel when visiting family in the area, consistently finding it well maintained with a friendly, welcoming, competent staff. It is the only hotel for us in the area.
Very nice room. We sat in the lobby by the fire and had a snack with wine. Very nice and peaceful. Would stay here again. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Easy to find hotel. Lovely pool. Too cold tonight!
I was checked in/out by Michelle at the front desk. The property was very nice and clean. We were welcomed as we entered and able to get checked in efficiently. I liked the fact there were waters, a snack and a fresh remote waiting when I went in the room. Michelle helped me out by printing my tickets so I... More

Rooms very comfortable, kitchen with plates and the works, nice separate wash/shower area in bathroom and living room with foldout couch!! Room was very clean - includes nice buffet style breakfast with hot items and many, many choices.
1st time in San Antonio. Wanted to be near the River Walk. Was a bit of a hike to the Convention Center but manageable. The hotel staff was friendly and the free breakfast and afternoon snack were good. The pool was on the roof and was nice. Asked for a room with a nice view and got a view of... More
Went to a Cardinals baseball game, and this is about 2 blocks away from stadium and 1 block away from ballpark village. We also visited Anheuser-Busch brewery, about a 5 minute drive. The hotel and staff are top notch and the breakfast was good and hot, also free. The free popcorn and 5:30 kickback with adult beverages and food are... More
I chose this hotel because it's location, I was there to visit the Gateway Arch and the courthouse museum. The hotel is across the street from the museum and next to the Arch. The room was very comfortable and clean. There was a cocktail hour with food that was free and free hot breakfast, both were great. I highly recommend... More
We had never stayed in a Drury hotel before, but from now on, we will always consider it if there's one in a city we travel to. The hotel itself is beautiful and was a nice luxury for us compared to the budget places we'd been staying in on our trip. They serve free food in the evenings that totally... More
This is a nice hotel, clean and secure, with very good evening snacks and Drinks from 530pm to 7pm and a Very good Breakfast Buffet 6am to 9am. Approximately 2 blocks to Busch Stadium and right next to The Arch park (under reconstruction). I would recommend this to any one.
My 2 Freinds and I had tickets to see the Who on a Saturday night down in St. Louis and needed a room in order to not travel back to central Illinois after the show. Now on a Saturday night on Easter weekend it was very busy time for the city and not so easy to find the desired room... More
Very nice, helpful staff that goes out of their way to greet and assist. Rooms are clean, well-maintained. Parking is less-expensive than most downtown hotels. On-site garage was full, but overflow garage was only a block away. Exceptional experience!!
Somewhat generic really nice hotel. Was disappointed king suite came without a view of the Arch. Which was basically my own fault for not asking before we settled in to the room. Room fee includes evening bar drinks and above average hot breakfast. Would definitely stay there again. Old Courthouse across the street is some kind of federally administered historical... More
One of the best hotels I ever stayed at! Perfect in every way! The location is perfect - between the Old Courthouse and the Arch Plaza. 2 blocks from Busch Stadium. A free shuttle to Busch brewery only 2 blocks away. The fitness center and pool is awesome! There are 2 bikes, 3 treadmills, 1 elliptical, many weights, weight machines... More
I would have given the Drury at the Arch a 5 rating, but gave it a 4 only because I think the rooms could use a little updating. Aside from that we loved our stay at the Drury Plaza at the Arch and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again in the future! I will also be looking for Drury Hotels... More
We typically book Drury hotels while traveling and this is my second stay in this location for business. Ask for a room with a street view ..not interior...had to change rooms and while it was much smaller the street view was much better than looking into your neighbors room. Breakfast okay, social hour limits your free drinks to three. They... More
We've stayed at many hotels in the St. Louis area ands keep coming back to this one. We can get a reasonably priced suite that gives us plenty of room for our family of 5. The free happy hour has served as dinner for the kids and the free breakfast is always a plus. It's within walking distance of the... More
We have never been to St Louis before, so we wanted to be centrally located to activities we had planned. Great rooms, very quiet. lots of perks, breakfast, midday snacks, pool, exercise room, secure parking was a big plus for us. the rate was reasonable too. Within walking distance to a lot of things to see and do!
I've gone to this location even as a kid. It's the only place I'll stay when visiting the area. It's rooms have a pefect view of the arch and the river. It's walking distance to the park and to 360 on the rooftop which my husband and I always have a ball at when we come to town. I love... More
I've stayed here twice while in the Mount Vernon area. This is an older hotel, that is well maintained. The rooms are clean, the bed is comfortable. There is also a small coffee and tea shop on the grounds, called the Java Hut. Reasonable priced...More
Writing the review largely to give a shout out the the women at the front desk who tried to help us after discovering that the hotel was overbooked and that our hotel.com booking was essentially not valid, despite the fact that it had been booked, paid for and guaranteed, several months prior. The only notification we received was a call... More
We enjoyed our first stay her at this location and received an overall good impression. We didn't realize it was right next door to the Knights inn Carmel hills and were afraid it might be a bad experience like it was at that hotel. Luckily it was completely different in a good way! The hot tub is great and the... More
Loved the room nothing bad to say about this place besides the hard mattress in the room my wife and I booked. The staff was very helpful and nice. I would definitely stay here again if they updated the mattresses. I mean the location was awesome ! Right off the freeway, down the street from cannery row, and to top... More
Our room was clean warm and inviting. The fire place was wonderful and cozy because of the rain. The hot tub in the room added romance and relaxation that was so needed for my husband and I. A morning walk to the park and then into town was very enjoyable. We found a very sweet restaurant for breakfast Old Monterey... More
The staff makes this already clean and well maintained hotel a great place to stay while in Cedar Rapids for work. The breakfast is included. The king bed room is large. The desk was sturdy and plenty of outlets for charging.
We booked this hotel because we just needed a place to sleep after attending an evening Hawkeye football game. All the hotels in Iowa city were booked, so we had to expand our search to Cedar Rapids. We knew we wouldn't be arriving until after 11pm, so I called earlier in the day and requested a late arrival. When we... More
I stayed here with my family for two nights during graduation weekend. The hotel doesn't have elevators and we were put on the second floor. We asked for a first floor room as I have a hard time walking upstairs, but was told no. The hotel claims they are smoke free, but the hallways smelled like smoke really bad. The... More
This was a very nice and clean property. The staff was very accommodating and the evening cookies were great. Also, at least for my visit coffee was available any time I wanted some and the cookies went well with a nice cup of coffee! The free hot breakfast was good with srambled eggs, saugage/bacon and assorted fruit and bagels. Overall... More
We have stayed at a Hampton Inn several times because we are family of 5 and it is accommodating. Since the rate is usually between 125 and 200 you get what you pay for. This time we definitely DID NOT GET WHAT WE PAID FOR. Because it was Easter weekend, we were charged 350 per night. What we did get... More
Amazing Time! Friendly and Relaxing Hotel! My family and I felt extremely comfortable at this hotel. The front desk workers were very kind and helpful. The room had plenty of room. Will definitely be back again.
Great place to stay! I was only needing a one night stay to go shelling on Sanibel for a day, totally satisfied with the accommodations! Breakfast was satisfactory, had a nice pool area, very close to the causeway over to Sanibel Island. Very clean.
The Hampton Inn in Fort Myers Beach was wonderful. It was quiet, had a nice pool area and the lobby was quite large. We arrived and were upgraded to a suite! The staff was very friendly and helpful, Great suggestions for food and events.
Very clean suite breakfast selections in the mornings we're awesome!! Including the waffle maker!! Fresh baked cookies every evening!! And the staff EVERYONE that I came in contact with for my week stay was alway pleasant and smiling faces and very helpful!!!
Everything was great. Highly recommend staying here. Staff was accommodating. Room was extremely clean and comfortable. Complimentary breakfast had a variety of choices. Everyone loves the waffle maker. Overall stay was outstanding. Will definitely return.
We enjoyed our stay here, made it easy to go to fort Myers Beach one day and Sanibel island the next. Minutes away from shopping and dining. Great price for the location easily get to anywhere you want to go.
Great stopover for the night close to airport. Very clean with all amenities. Pool much smaller than in picture but adequate and prettily landscaped and very clean. The complimentary breakfast was very nice with sufficient choices to satisfy any family including waffles, fresh fruit, yogurts, pastries, and eggs and sausage
Convenient to beach, off beaten path, close to restAurants and shopping. Clean, quiet, helpful staff. Great job Javier! Would definitely come back. Breakfast adequate. Fresh fruit. Good coffee. Dining area clean. Only downside was loud ac and the duvet was thick enough for a blizzard.
The staff is very courteous and helpful. I recommend this hotel for anyone who needs a nice out of the way place to stay. It is a convenient location.

Let's just call a spade a spade. There was an arrest outside of our hotel room at 1am. The place was filthy. Never stay here. However, the people running it were very helpful, kind people. I hope that they can invest in their property and make it better.
From the tattered mattresses to the joke of a breakfast, this place is the place of bad dreams. Which is exactly what I kept having when I realized our door DIDN'T LOCK PROPERLY. The only positive thing about this place was that the front desk person was polite and courteous.
A group of us went for the weekend to Palm Springs and stayed at the Desert Eclipse.

Great location! The hotel has an excellent staff and wonderful rooms! Our room was nice and clean and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Great breakfast and nice swimming area as well.
We found this hotel online with a discount coupon. Checked out the website and everything looked great...it boasts free shuttle service to Disneyland and Knotts and that it is a mile and a half away from Disneyland. Try about 5 miles. Took forever to find it. It was in this wierd, old part of town, off the beaten path, right on the main drag of Brookhurst street. Outside appearance was a little icky. It had an unattractive closed down restaurant as part of the hotel and an old shuttle that was sitting in the front. To our dismay, there were no longer any shuttle services offered. The rooms were old and a little bit dingy. You can hear people in the other rooms taking showers. The beds were not at all comfortable. TV got only a few stations. Definately not what we expected. We thought it was going to be a classy hotel by Disneyland. We felt slightly misled by the website. The perks The rooms had a microwave and little refridgerator. The pool was nice and secluded, very quiet and clean. My nephew and I swam for 2 hours, all alone! We were the only ones out there, it was great! Friendly staff, willing to help. Overall, this wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I will be much more diligent in the future when I do research for hotels.
Stayed one night while traveling summer, 2015. The staff was friendly. Complimentary breakfast was the typical selection. Breakfast area was small. The refrigerator that contained yogurt was a bit obscured. It was on the floor underneath a countertop. I did not notice it until I saw someone squat down to open the door and remove a yogurt.

Don't let its outward appearance fool you. If you want a solid night's sleep on your journey, this is the hotel. The mattresses are firm and comfortable.

We've been camping at Spur of the Moment Ranch for several years. It's a great convenience for those with ATVs to be right on the trail system. Their location is great, too. Ann Skip are very friendly and helpful.
Convenient area to freeway in Culver City. Easy to book thru Booking.com. I chose not to stay after viewing room. Carpet needed vacuuming, mirrors with fingerprints, hair in sink, dusty furniture, poor quality of towels. Called Booking.com who were extremely helpful in talking with manager of motel. We received full refund.
Great idea to rent town-home-sized units. Was very useful for our family. Kids loved their own room as opposed to a hotel suite, etc. Kitchen amenities were very useful. Felt like a small home away from home (which is what we were after). Very few options in Duchesne, UT. Would say this is definitely the best option for a family.
There are several other hotels in the area I would try the others before this one. I would not choose this Travelodge ever again. Service was not great rooms were bad. They even charge for ice. Good luck
The staff was really nice, they had a smile and greeted in a friendly manner. The staff was always there to help with all the needs and the questions that I had. The room was a clean and the bed was really comfortable.Nita, Thank you for been satisfied 100 of your stay.
The Travelodge in downtown Phoenix is an architectural gem. It still has the 1960s Googie exterior design, a definite attraction. The hotel grounds are very clean, so was my room. There is a cute patio area with outdoor carpeting and lights. The price is right if you just want a comfortable bed and hot shower. The WiFi is free and the TV works well. Restaurants are within walking distance, including a McDs next door if you go for that kind of cuisine. Judy,That your stay was wonderful and it was clean for you and everything was walking distance. Yes, we do over best to satisfied every person.
great hotel, a bit old, but right in the thick of Waikiki beach - I totally would stay here again! The rooms are a bit small our balcony faced away from the beach, but still - a great deal for a nice simple room!!!!
This hotel was excellent value for the money and we had a sea view as well. It is very well located in the centre of the activity. It is very handy to good breakfast places as well as other restaurants.
Best spot on Waikiki - the views are magnifient. Staff are lovely. Rooms recently renovated. Prices reasonable. Close to everything. Able to watch the Hula shows from our balcony. Hoping to go again next year and wouldn't stay anywhere else.
This place is nice and simple and is so close to everything. When we come back to Hawaii we will definitely be staying there again as the price was so good. The staff were also very helpful and the rooms were very clean.
We stayed there thinking it would be creepy and not like the photos showed. Boy were we blown away! Absolutely beautiful. Very clean and the owners are very attentive with respect of your privacy. I would go back in a heartbeat.Thank you!
I recently stayed at the Big T Motel. I enjoyed talking with John, the owner. My room was very clean. The A/C worked well. Although a little dated, everything was in working order. My room had a fridge and microwave. I parked right in front of my room. The printed sheets on the bed and the colored bath towels gave... More
We stayed here for two nights before our cruise. The room was clean, comfortable, and spacious. The staff was highly professional and courteous. The Hampton Inn breakfast is always delicious. This was a wonderful place to stay before sailing. The only down side: although there is a convenient parking garage, parking fees are extra.
Disappointed that the hotel charges guests for parking. Check in on the sixth floor. Desk on the first floor is for information to tell you to go to the sixth floor. Breakfast is consistent with the hotel chain. Drink cards in place of cookies is a nice perk.
This hotel has become our regular place whenever we visit Miami. It's a short walk to the Metro Mover, trolley, Publix supermarket, and many restaurants. Love the convenience of having the sink outside the toilet/shower room so more than one person can get ready at a time. Special shout out to Jorge at the front desk for making us feel... More
Picked this hotel based on location and reviews from Trip Advisor. The weekend was two ball games at Marlins Park with the Cubs. Perfect location for the ball park. Eight minutes away by car and close to Metro if you want to go by train. The place is clean and the breakfast buffet is quite extensive. Great sports bar next... More
Great room which was done very upscale way.The furniture was of the highest quality and made the room feel homely.Property looked beautiful from the outside and was located near some trendy restaurants.
This hotel is almost brand new and in a very trendy area of Miami. Very nicely appointed hotel with a very nice bar and pool on/in it. Some staff particularly the front desk and door staff was great. Disappointed in housekeeping and breakfast staff who generally wouldn't speak to you even if you spoke to them. Internet also didn't work... More
Great Hampton in Brickell. Have stayed numerous times and has always been a wonderful hotel. Highly recommend for the location, cleanliness and the extremely pleasant staff. Welcoming and friendly. Can't wait to go back
Just returned from a cruise, which included 2 nights in Miami. Lobby is on the 6th floor, close to many restaurants and bars. Rooms were nice (on the smaller side), bathroom bigger than most hotels. Ask for a room on a high floor since there is much traffic in downtown. Breakfast was included and is your typical Hampton's breakfast a... More
Very clean! Staff very friendly , helpful, accomodating. They have a shuttle to Cruiseport for small fee. Good breakfast. Great restaurants only two blocks away - recommend by front desk staff. Check in is on sixth level. Great hotel all the way around!
I stay regularly here in Brickell and the hotel and staff never let me down. The hotel is right in the center of Brickell, next door to the bars and restaurants. The metro rail and transit line are at the end of the road and the train to Miami airport takes 20mins. This is a great place for business and... More
This hotel and its staff are truly amazing. The art is funky, fun, tropical and all real! Rooms are young, hip, yet classy! Front desk treat me consistently like I am royalty. Stayed with this property two times in the past month for business.
I was lucky to find this hotel that was very close to the hotel, which i was taking a 2.5 day review course for my certification. It was very upbeat in its decor and our room was quiet, clean and comfy. I traveled with my family so free breakfast was a plus so that we could fill our bellies until... More
I stayed here recently on a business trip to Miami and was very pleasantly surprised. This is a step up from most Hampton Inn's I've stayed at in the past. The location is great if you need to be in the Brickell area. It's right near 13th and Brickell. The rooms are comfortable and the free wifi is great. The... More
Very well served while I was there. Enjoyed my stay. Great time food, amenities, close to metro system and airport. I would recommend to any of my family and friends. Hilton honors was a plus in helping me register.
Very nice one night stay at this hotel! Stayed on the Elite floor (15). Hotel and room was extremely clean. We were given 4 drink coupons at check-in to use until 11pm. However, the bar closed at 10:15pm because the bartender was sick and no one else was there to fill in for her. In the room, there were snacks... More
We booked this hotel based on the excellent reviews. We were in Miami for 2 days prior to our cruise and we found this hotel to be everything we were promised and more. Located right near the people mover metro station so it's a convenient walk without the need for a taxi. We arrived at 7:00 am because we were... More
Great Location near metro mover station, Nice accommodations within walking distance to many attractions. Room was plenty big for 3 people staying. Staff was very accommodating to our requests. Would recommend this place to others.
Only stayed one night before a cruise. But, clean, friendly staff, helpful staff, accessible, well located, and a hotel that recycles!!!! Comparable pricing to anything in Miami. Do wish all elevators were working...takes a while to get one.
I was pleasantly surprised with the extremely professional staff I met at Hampton Inn Suites by Hilton - Miami Brickell Downtown.

Sorry to have to say that this was a total disappointment. When I checked in, I was told that someone had called and cancelled the last two nights.

The Hilton Hotel is located very close to all major shopping in the Concord area. The hotel itself is a nice example of a Hilton hotel, and the staff and rooms reflect that level of service. Expect to be taken care of well.
Above par when comparing with the other motels in this area. No breakfast which is normal in all the Motel 6's.

We are continually working to enhance the guest experience and will use your comments to do so. We hope to see you back next time you come to town.
I stayed here with a friend for two nights. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean and felt safe. It is located right between the magnificent mile and the millennium park, which had many attractions worth going for a tourist.
I booked through hotwire. The location was excellent, however the room I got was the smallest room available. It was no bigger than a cruise ship inside cabin. Housekeeping forgot to leave soap and towels one day. Overall its an ok hotel for the price.
My husband and I recently stayed one night at the River Hotel. The room was clean, but small. For an overnight stay it was perfect for our needs. Will definitely return for short stays in the city!!!!!
Stayed here with my wife 7/26 27 hotel is in a great spot in the city just off of the river and directly across from the Trump building. It is within walking distance of Navy Pier and surrounded by great restaurants. The restaurant within the hotel has a very extensive menu though we didn't eat there. But we did have a few drinks and the staff is very hospitable. If the weather had been cooler we would have sat outside.The hotel was very clean and our room was nice the only thing I didn't like was there was no counter in the bathroom but this could have been because our room seemed to be handicap accessible, perhaps that was error in the reservation not sure.Overall it was fun staff was nice, hotel was clean, and we had a good trip.Thank you, Tyler W, for choosing the River Hotel and posting your review. We agree with you -- our prime location in the heart of Chicago is ideal for visiting and experiencing the city. We will be sure our dedicated staff members see your comments about the clean room and fun staff as they will be most appreciative.Please come see us again!
The best hotel so far I have stayed. Staffs are very friendly especially the manager (Pedro) he was very sweat. I miss that hotel now...They were able to offer early check in which really helped us as we took early morning flight... Thank you.
Our recent stay at the River Hotel was excellent. We stayed in the two bedroom suite since we were a family of 4. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is great we could walk to almost anywhere!
We stayed at the River Hotel for 3 nights over New Years and very much enjoyed our stay. GREAT location for all of the New Years events put on by ChiTown Rising. The staff was wonderful and even got us a room with a better view at check-in. Pedro was great at the front desk!!! Rooms are smaller than what you would find in other hotels, but there is so much to do in Chicago we really only spent time in our room when we were sleeping. It is right on the BigBus tour line, so we found it really easy to get around town if we were headed somewhere further away than we wanted to walk.Thank you, Kelsey W, for choosing to stay at the River Hotel during your New Year celebration in Chicago. We agree with you - we have a prime location to enjoy all the attractions and festivities taking place in the city - year round!I am so pleased that Pedro and the hotel staff were able to be of service to you... I will make certain they see your kind words.Thanks again!
We stayed here March 8-10, 2013. Check-in was breeze. Very friendly staff. The room was better than I expected it to be. We were within walking distant to many stores, restaurants, Navy Pier, L stops and bus stops. The workout room was much smaller than the photo depicted but was well equipped for it's size. I would definitely recommend their valet parking. Very affordable with unlimited in and out privileges. Overall, I was very impressed and would definitely stay here again!

Room very very small, no view. Sink was clogged not enough towels when we arrived but was fixed right away when brought to your attention. A safe would have been nice. 655 for 2 days (includes valet parking) was pricey for what we are used to, otherwise we enjoyed our stay. Staff was excellent room nice clean. Great air conditioning.Thank you for staying at the River Hotel. We appreciate your candid feedback about your experience. I apologize for the issues you experienced initially, but am happy to know the team responded appropriately. Please know we have many room types and sizes available I hope you will book a larger room and try us again on your next trip.Thank you again!
We loved the location of this hotel, right by the river within easy walking distance of both the loop and magnificent mile. Staff were friendly helpful. The room was clean comfortable.
First the room was super tiny. Like so tiny you could sit on the toilet and reach out and touch the bed. We could hear rats running in the ceiling. There were several holes in the sheets. It is not worth the money and there are so many other great choices in Chicago. Hello kellydD9581QQ,Thank you for choosing to stay at Chicago River Hotel and providing feedback about your experience. Please know we do offer different room types of different sizes to suit the different needs of our travelers. Our smallest room type is small but should have all essentials someone should need for their stay. In regards to your comment about rats, this is not true. We do not have rats in the ceiling nor anywhere else in the building and take this very seriously.

Because it was our first trip to Chicago, we worried about choosing a hotel by the web. Ended up at the River Hotel and were happily and totally satisfied. Our 2 BR, 2 BA suite worked very well for the family. Dcor was up-to-date, beds comfortable, and kitchen adequate. Baths were very nice. Good exercise facility and handy laundry. Staff extremely helpful. Location was great - on the Chicago River, near restaurants, theater district, and subway stops. Architecture boat tour leaves a block away. Very good value.
Stayed here 10/22-10/27/2017. I live in Chicago's north suburbs and had to be downtown early for long days working. Stayed here to avoid the commute. Worked out really well. The rooms are small but excellent for a solo business person. The location is excellent for business in the Loop. Price is excellent too.Hello Jim N,Thank you for staying with us at Chicago River Hotel during your recent visit from the suburbs. We are glad to hear our location and the price point made your long work week easier than having to commute so far each day. Hopefully we will get the opportunity to serve you again in the future!

We loved the location of this hotel in the center of everything in Chicago. The room was on the small side but very comfortable and pleasant. Our view of the Chicago River was spectacular. I would definitely stay there again.
Great location. From the staff. They need to remodel the elevator and some parts of the hotel. Siri did not work for two days in a row. I told the lady at the front desk and she offered no compensation,
We had a great experience at River Hotel. Due to airline issues, we arrived at 1:00 am, and they held our room for us and even gave us a river view at our request upon arrival. They gave us restaurant recommendations and helped out with getting around. We never felt like our questions were bothering them or they were too busy for us. They even helped us print our return flight tickets before leaving.We did not feel that the room was small at all, like we saw some others say. It was the same size as other hotel rooms we've been in. We loved the charm of the building, rather than being in a newly built hotel. We liked the accommodations in general. My only negative was our water pressure in the shower. It was practically nonexistent...I felt like Kramer on Seinfeld...took forever to do my hair afterwards.The location is AMAZING. Right in the middle of things and along the river. The L-train stop is nearby with several lines that meet there. It is right across from Trump Tower (take that as you may, I suppose). Like others have said, you can walk to so much. Overall, amazing experience. We will go back.

On a vacation to Chicago IL we made reservations at the River Hotel. From the excellent care from Roman King upon our arrival to the very efficient, clean and comfortable room our stay at the River Hotel was wonderful. The River Hotel goes above and beyond the traveler's expectations with very helpful extras. The complimentary chilled purified water in refillable bottles and complimentary laundry facilities were wonderful. Roman King greeted us warmly, facilitated a very speedy and smooth check in and gave us excellent restaurant recommendations for our dinner meals. The location near the Trump building is perfect for easy access to transportation and walking to key Chicago sites. We are now big fans of the River Hotel! Thanks for a very enjoyable stay.

River taxis go between Michigan Ave and Navy Pier. House of Blues right across river. Room was small but very clean. Nothing fancy, but still nice.
My husband and I recently stayed at the River Hotel while on a long weekend getaway to Chicago. It is in the absolute heart of downtown, and VERY conveniently within walking distance of just about everything touristy (Magnificent Mile, the bean at Millenium Park, we even walked all the way to the Shedd Aquarium). We got a really good rate for the room. It was small, however was still cozy. We had a river view and a fabulous view of the word TRUMP (..tower across the street). The only reason I would rate this 4 and not 5 stars is the bed... was... not at all comfortable, and I hate to say that. Both my husband and I were not well rested the entire weekend. None the less, it was perfect for what we needed and we had a great time! Staff was super friendly as well.Dear Hillary W,Thank you for choosing to stay at the River Hotel. We truly appreciate you taking the time for your review as all feedback is welcomed. I am so pleased you found the staff friendly and were able to enjoy our prime location in the heart of the city.

We stayed here one night and normally wouldn't be able to afford a hotel on the Magnificent Mile. The room was small but very clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable and we had a quiet night's sleep.Didn't check out the hotel's restaurant but there were plenty within walking distance as well as bars and clubs, and close cafes in the morning. Overall, great value
This is a lovely hotel next to the Chicago River and two blocks from Michigan Ave. The staff were incredibly helpful. The room was not large but was very comfortable. We stayed in the Clubquarters section of the hotel. Snacks are provided during the day and each floor has a water station with chilled filtered water.

I love being able to pass along great comments to our staff members. The entire team will be so pleased they were able to exceed expectations. I will be sure to pass along your kind words and my thanks as well.We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit!
This was a pretty decent hotel for business travel. The room and bed was comfortable. The rooms are definitely small, but I didn't really spend much time in my room anyway. I didn't love that you have to go to a utility closet outside of your room to grab a ironing board and iron, but not a big deal -- kind of unique and boutiquey, I guess. This is definitely a unique hotel and modern hotel.The water pressure in the shower was really bad though, unfortunately. It took absolutely forever to rinse since there was nearly no water coming out -- not to mention the cold and uncomfortable feeling of being wet and cold without enough warm water rushing out. Why do so many hotels have water pressure issues This always drives me nuts -- it is so hit and miss too. One hotel will have great pressure in the city, and the next horrible.. I wish more reviewers spoke to water pressure haha. Or is that just me who cares about thatThe location is excellent -- right on the river and close by everything you need. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.I unfortunately got a room with no view so I cannot comment on the view, but I am sure the view would have been incredible from that location, if you had a river view. My window was quite small though, so not sure how they are on the other side of the building. Overall, if you're staying in Chicago, you will likely enjoy your stay at this hotel. It's basic and does the job. Very clean, modern and standard. One of the biggest things that determines my feelings on a hotel is the bathroom / shower experience.. its like make and break for me haha! So, unless they fix the water pressure issues, I likely won't be staying here again.Hello cformosa4,We truly appreciate your visit and thoughtful review.

We had a good experience here. It is a bit pricey for the amenities and the size of the room, but fit our needs. The rooms are a lot smaller than most hotels. This was fine as we used the room as a home base and not a hang out place. The bed seemed somewhere between a queen and a full size. We did find a long hair on the mattress pad (I check for bed bugs, and you should too! I didn't find any or experience any here or ever, but I am really scared of them). There is no tub, just a shower stall. Small bathroom. But again, fit our needs. As other reviews have said, the sheets are very scratchy. This was my only complaint. The location is great, right in the middle of downtown, convenient to everything. It was just about 3 blocks from our El stop. The restaurant downstairs was pretty good, and very convenient for breakfast. We found the staff polite and helpful, though our interactions with them were limited. The fitness room was sufficient, the machines were fairly new. It was not fancy, but the equipment was good quality. It is a small space. The filtered water and bottles on each floor was a nice touch. We would go back.
My three night stay was absolutely perfect. The check in process was so easy it seriously took 3 min . The girl that helped me checking in was so friendly and welcoming . I had a long flight and horrible cab ride and this young woman was so refreshing. My room was clean , modern and quiet. The room had a keurig coffee machine which was nice . They have free cold filtered water and bottles on ever floor. My room view was outstanding. Convenient location to all the downtown tourist spots. I will absolutely stay here again because the hotel was nice but Honestly the staff was incredible .

This hotel could not be better situated , right on the river a block from Michigan Ave.As a result it is within walking distance of most of what anyone would want to see in Chicago.The rooms are a good size , well appointed and clean.A pity the area adjacent to the elevator on the 14th floor wasn't vacuumed for the 4 days we were there..
I had a week-end in this delightful hotel. The staff were welcoming, cheerful, helpful and polite. The two rooms we had were spotless and the beds comfortable and clean. The rooms are not big but perfectly adequate. There is a restaurant right inside the hotel and the food was excellent. I would definitely go back if I am ever in Chicago again, as will my son when he takes his wife.

We are delighted to hear you found the staff to be welcoming and helpful and your rooms to be clean. We pride ourselves on both of these and love to hear when it shows to our guests. We look forward to seeing you and your son again next time either of you are in town.
Very nice hotel.. excellent staff. Room was very clean and nicely appointed. The shower was a little cramped and odd shaped. But it was really nice overall...including evening wine. Will come back in the future.Thank you for choosing the River Hotel. I am happy to know you were well looked after by our service team. I will be sure they see your kind words. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit!
We stayed at Club Quarters this weekend. It was the SMALLEST room we've ever stayed in. It was fine for one person and even though the room was well appointed, it really didn't fit our needs. Plus we were in the Tower. Very scary looking...More
The River Hotel is a very special place perfectly located in a beautiful old building, right downtown and with a spectacular view of the river and its bustle from our window. The place is really warm and comfortable.We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
Our stay was made very memorable by the incredible view of the Chicago River this hotel provided as well as a very pleasant stay in the hotel itself. We stayed on the 16th floor with an amazing view of the river. We chose a small room, but it was still well designed and comfortable. Great artwork! We appreciated the free wi-fi and coffee in our room as well. Our room was clean and quiet at night. Jay was very friendly and helpful at check in. Everyone we met who worked at this hotel was very nice. Best of all, is the hotel location! The River Walk is right outside the hotel. It is a great place to run or walk if you want, or to just sit and watch all the boats going by. We walked everywhere from this hotel. Great nightlife, museums, Eataly and Millennium Park are all close by. The restaurant Bella Bacino, located in the hotel lobby, had an amazing kale salad and a lighter Italian pizza that was also very good. There's also an outside patio, too. Also, the Corner Bakery Cafe is just down the street. We definitely will be coming back! This is our new favorite location in Chicago.Thank you, travelbuff101, for your thoughtful review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you were able to enjoy the iconic views as well as our prime location in the heart of Chicago. I am especially pleased to hear your comments about the friendly and helpful service provided by Jay and the hotel staff. I will be sure they see your kind words. We are so glad to be your new favorite location in Chicago and look forward to seeing you in the future.
No frills hotel but clean and safe. Our room was on the 8th floor with a bit of a river view And small but we spent so little time in the room that it didn't matter. Staff was friendly and helpful.
I stayed there last night after bicycling the tunnel hill trail from Karmak. Super clean rooms, very affordable and within walking distance of two good eating and drinking establishments. A great find after a long hot bicycle ride. The lady at the front desk was very nice although she wasn't excited about me keeping my bike in the room. They... More
Every part of the experience was 5-star. Yet the price was barely more than the older hotels in town. Very quiet rooms despite being next to the highway. Restaurants nearby, but not really walkable due to the highway. Nice pool.
I have travelled from Ontario, Canada to Best Western Valley View several times Most recently December 2015, February 2016 and I have scheduled again for this coming weekend.

I visited this place last summer and it was one of the good hotel i visited so far. Quite and comfy. Front desk lady was nice. Big room and good breakfast. Lots of good restaurants nearby.Room is clean.
The hotel was very nice and the breakfast was delicious but the buffet area is extremely cramped. Would be nice if they had pay per view so we could have watched the fight but other than that no complaints!
This hotel was so clean. So well kept. The value and then to have a hot breakfast included was fantastic. I would recommend anyone to stay here. This was our half way piont driving from PA to Nashville.
Stayed at this fine establishment for the second time since November and our experience was literally a mirror image of our first stay. Lori Womack is the GM and she and her entire staff are very focused on the guest experience and it shows in the details. We asked for a king room near the lobby and that is what... More
Staff very helpful and friendly. Great price! Clean remodeled room. Close to area restaurants. Very good breakfast! Will be back as I travel to Roanoke often. This was a last minute find and I couldn't be happier!
Quiet, friendly, clean, love the fresh cookies that greeted us. Nice full hot breakfast., more than just a waffle. Comfy bed, tub, spacious.i would defiantly recommend a stay here. Lots of parking too. Nice staff.
Come for the clean rooms and fluffy pillows but STAY for the full American Breakfast! Make your own waffle, pile on scrambled eggs, sausage patties, cover with sausage gravy.

My husband I were traveling back to NY from Nashville. After driving many hours hundreds of miles, we needed a clean comfortable bed to sleep in. We stopped at the Best Western hoping they had availability, they did. The room was large, very clean, the bed was comfortable we even got free breakfast in the morning. I... More
Room was very clean. Breakfast was good. Only problem is that the breakfast serving area is too small and too crowded for the large number of guests. Attendant did a good job keeping the items stocked, but again not a good location and size to try and feed so many guests. Very frustrating!!
Outstanding! Many thanks to the management and staff for going over and above the call of duty to help out our animal rescue group! We drove overnight from Tennessee to meet another rescue group from Connecticut to deliver a huge load of former shelter dogs and cats on their way to the cool, blue north!

This is the second time we have stayed at this fine hotel while traveling from South Carolina back to CT and we will continue to do so! Staff and facilities were welcoming and location was close to many eating establishments. Heated pool, great welcome bag to Best Western Elite members and cheerful front desk made this a great experience!
This is our 2nd hotel that we've stayed at on Route 66. The price was very reasonable but with that price comes some sacrifices. One of them being is no breakfast. The rooms are small, quaint and the beds were comfortable. The hotel that we stayed at the night before outside of Sequoia National Forest was twice the price and... More
First of all, it's a miracle that this motel is still standing and mostly functional. It's very authentic for what it was built for, which is to say cheap, one-night lodging for people driving long distance. But this place is not for everyone, at least. The rooms are spartan, in keeping with earlier times, and not very big. Our room... More
Will definitely stay again. Employees are exceptional. Always smiling and knowledgeable. Loved the private balcony and the view. Indoor heated pool was great. Bathroom is small. The mattresses are a little to firm and pillows are a to soft.
Late in the day after 11 hours of driving, along this stretch of I-29 there's few options so we chose the Desoto Inn. Big mistake. First, the non-smoking room we were assigned wreaked of smoke. Okay, change rooms. Our next room assignment had mold in the bathroom and ants on the a-c. That's enough negatives for anyone but we were... More
This hotel is very nice. Young lady at front desk was helpful and kind. Rooms look exactly like it does on web. Very clean and neat. The hotel is surrounded with all types of places to eat within walking distance
It is a family ran motel. At first it didn't look very appealing but i asked to see the room.

We stayed 2 nights at the Pelican by the Sea Motel. We were in town for the Seafood festival which was only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel.

This hotel is located right on Main St. It is, however,quite outdated, but the rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. Pastries for breakfast and no decaf coffee. Four stars only because of that.
This hotel had great customer service. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Affordable rates. We were also impressed with the selection at the continental breakfast. Good food and coffee/tea choices.
The Marriot always exceeds my expectation. The service is friendly and the breakfast was pretty darn good. The rooms were clean with a microwave and a fridge. This is our go to hotel when we go over the border shopping.
Stayed here for a week at the beginning of May and one week at the end of May. Staff are very friendly. Room always cleaned with nothing missed. Extra towels was no problem. Breakfast was simple but good.
The Hilton Garden Inn, is a beautiful, well maintained hotel. Ideal location in Chesterton, Indiana close to all. Nice meeting space and pretty outdoor areas as well. The lobby is cozy, modern and ideal.Thank you so much for the positive review. We truly appreciate your feedback!
Great stay as always. Love being able to use a bike while I'm there... Food and bar area are the best in town in my opinion, great staff. The cars a block north race a bit and cruise thru town at night and my window was facing that street so heard that for too long at night, same cars with... More
Modern has redone their hotel and it looks and feels brand new, and totally-Modern . The Cocktails were excellent and food great--All the service was exceptional and our bed was so comfortable we actually looked at the brand it was.
The staff are friendly and helpful. We had pre wedding photos taken in the lobby, bar and outside and everyone was happy to be helpful in any way possible. The room was great! The bathroom was outstanding and our friends loved the bar. I cant say enough good things. We have already booked for our anniversary next year.
Friendly, clean and very well appointed. Could not ask for more. Although we did not dine there, the food looked excellent as well. Great coffee in the morning. Will definetly return and recommend to friends!
We have stayed here before and once again enjoyed our visit.

A friend and I enjoyed our two night stay at this HIE. Everything was very clean and shiny, and the beds were extra comfy. Since it was August, we were invited to have pancakes in the lobby during the evening, which fit very well in our schedule. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, especially the desk people and breakfast buffet... More
Very nice hotel only about a year old. Rooms were very clean, nice size with very comfortable bed and furnishing including a microwave and fridge. Inside was well lighted and smelled new. We were on the second floor. Brunswick is a Railroad town and many of the railroad engineers stay at the hotel Check in is a the Diner. Diner... More
Guestroom was clean and orderly as we would expect of a Wyndam Hotel. Breakfast was not well served or kept up during the time it was available. Plenty of coffee, though!
Very good value. Our heater was not working. We told the staff and was given another room right away. We found the staff helpful. Breakfast is adequate.
I've stayed here before while visiting family in Samammish. The room was clean but had no wasted space, the area is quiet, the staff were responsive. Pleasant staff. the internet was a little slow for my daughter, but I had no problems when I used it. Not advertised, but there is a little gathering area with table and chairs under... More
After a terrible experience at the beginning of our trip at a Days Inn, I was a little afraid of what I would find here. We had an advanced purchase booking, however, so had no choice but to brave the stay, and I was pleasantly and thankfully surprised! Room was beautifully clean and smell free, bed was comfortable, and the... More
We needed a hotel in this part of town, but had few options. We chose this hotel based on the brand and the price. We could have stayed elsewhere for less money, but assumed the higher price meant we'd be more comfortable. We were wrong. I would consider this hotel to be at the lower end of budget hotel comfort,... More
I am a frequent guest at this property during my business in the Seattle area and this experience was consistent with all of my other stays. The staff is extremely customer service oriented, especially Megan. The room was clean and well kempt.
The queen bed was comfortable. The room was clean. Bathroom is tiny and the proximity of the door to the toilet not optimal. Breakfast room clean. No boiled eggs or protein. There were bagels, yogurt, 3 dry cereals, milk, coffee and probably juice, oranges and typical red delicious apples.. It would have been nice to have something a little more... More
Extremely clean rooms, even in the corners! The owners obviously take pride in the establishment and our stay there was very relaxing and pleasant. The room itself was a bit on the small side and there was no breakfast included, however with the fridge and microwave this wasn't a problem to buy and reheat something ourselves. The price was excellent... More
Although an older facility, it is spotlessly maintained and very well equipped, with microwave, fridge, coffeemaker and newer TV in our room. Staff was friendly and efficient. Close to dining and shopping and a quick trip toward the beach. Only drawback is road accessibility, and if you are coming off I-75, take Jacaranda Road to Center road, but do NOT... More
This hotel is 1 of 2 hotels in the town of Winnfield,LA. I have been very familiar with this little town since I do have family that lives here.

This place was somewhat too expensive for me, but I chose it because close distance to the Convention Center was critical for me, and closer hotels were even more expensive. The place is just 10 minutes walk from the Convention Center. The road from the enter to the hotel is uphill. My room was clean and spacious, with a closet. The windows faced downhill with a broad view. The only problem was a fan below the windows. I heard its noise when I opened the window. Nevertheless, my overall rating is very good.Dear mikhail534, Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Hotel Sorrento.I am so pleased to know that you enjoyed the hotel's location and the guestroom appointments, I am, however, disappointed to learn of fan noise, when you opened the window. Please know that I very much appreciate your feedback, as it is only in this way that we can improve upon our shortcomings. We hope you will return again so we can ensure your stay is flawless from beginning to end. Best regards, Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
Beautiful hotel in a great location. Staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed in the Sorrento Suite, which was the perfect space to relax and also enjoy while getting ready to go out for the evening. There were no issues with noise at all. The bartender could actually make a cocktail and the breakfast was excellent. We will definitely return.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We strive to make this a relaxing and welcoming place for all our visitors. I'm happy to hear you enjoyed your breakfast and I agree that our bartenders can make a cocktail! Please come and stay with us again soon. Angie M. MykelGeneral Manager-Hotel Sorrento
Excellent hotel for location and price. Had two rooms for seven people and found them very comfortable. Rooms were spacious with comfortable queen beds. Would have like to have breakfast included at this price.Dear Smrboston,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent family vacation experience at Hotel Sorrento.We were thrilled that you enjoyed your visit! Your comment regarding breakfast is well received. We have been discussing lately the cost surprise that many Guests have with breakfast. We currently offer a BB package which is very useful and a better value and by the end of July we are testing a coffee feature in our fireside lounge, for the busy morning period that will offer delicious and quick options, along with the Dunbar's regular sit down menu. Your feedback seems right on target with our thoughts.I hope that you will find a reason to return, and see for yourself the options we are adding to breakfast to delight our Guests.Thank you again for choosing to stay with Hotel Sorrento.At Your Service, Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
I'd always stayed in downtown when I visited Seattle, but decided to try something different this time, which led me to The Sorrento. I couldn't be happier about my choice. The First Hill location is quiet, mostly residential plus a couple hospitals. It's sort of between Capitol Hill and downtown, which are my favorite neighborhoods and within walking distance. Immediately near the hotel, there are Starbucks, Top Pot Donuts, McDonald, Walgreens (I think) and Bank of America - all that convenience! The hotel itself is full of old world charm w/o feeling stuffy or dated. Its restaurant Dunbar Room was excellent - the ambience and hospitality actually reminded me of New Orleans. I stayed at the junior suite - it's big and has a lot of nice details from a design standpoint. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, which made my stay even more wonderful. My only frustration was weak, spotty WiFi - it could just be that particular weekend but I'd keep in mind if you travel for business and WiFi is crucial.Any comparison to the Big Easy I'll take! I am happy to read your comments about the staff, I agree, they are wonderful. We're working to improve our Wi-Fi for the future. Thank you for the kind words regarding your experience at Hotel Sorrento. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!Angie M. MykelGeneral ManagerHotel Sorrento
Travelled with my partner to Seattle for the first time in July 2013, and after researching around on Tripadvisor and compare notes with other websites, we decided to pick Sorrento Hotel. And we did not regret it! :)It set a good start for our Seattle trip - we arrived a few hours earlier than the usual check-in time, and when we approached the reception to check-in, we were told we can do so right away - that put a HUGE smile on our face, since we've been up since 5am to catch our flight and we were totally worn out! Excellent customer service!This is an updated classic semi-luxurious hotel - I personally love the building, the hotel classic decor and settings, the room is updated and yet classy, clean, spacious and unlike other old hotels, it does not have that 'moldy' carpet smell. The room comes with your own freshly ground coffee and french-press.:)The location is great - within walking distance to literally everywhere. We walked to a whole lot of places, i.e. Pike Market, Capitol Hill, etc... we even walked all the way to the Space Needle!There's a li'l bar inside the hotel and I did enjoy a couple cocktails there. There's also a bar across the street called Quarter Lounge, check it out. And if you need pharmacy or coffee fix, they are all along the Main St right outside the hotel. Very convenient.Hope this helps. :)Wow! Thank you for such a great review.So glad you enjoyed your stay! Hope to see you again soon.Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
A perfect place to stay near major hospitals with discount rooms for patients. The large suite was very comfortable and well appointed but the air conditioner was very noisy and the pipes were leaking from the unit. All of the staff were very friendly and most helpful with special needs for the patient.Thank you for your feedback - we're glad you found our hotel convenient for your stay. Thank you also for your feedback on your air conditioner and the pipes. We are in the process of upgrading many things at the hotel including the pipes attached to the air conditioning. We hope you'll return for a visit in the future!
I stayed in the Sorrento at First Hill in Seattle on business. While an older hotel it was warm and inviting with a friendly staff and a great location. The lounge was a fantastic place to hang out and the bar/restaurant just right. Note to the hotel: The single elevator seems to be a bit creaky and should be replaced, though.Thank you so much for your kind comments. I am so glad that you found our location to be so convenient. Hope to see you again soon!Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
This hotel is fantastic in so many ways. Check-in was a breeze as we were warmly welcomed. Upon inspecting our corner room, I saw that it was 2 double beds for our romantic getaway, which was not what I had planned. In a few minutes after calling the front desk, the clerk personally came up to accompany us to the same room 2 floors higher with a king bed--perfect! It was a suite but we have never seen such spacious hotel accommodations. The living room was huge the bedroom oversized as well. The bathroom was tiny, but not a problem. We have a round window that opened from the shower it was fun to open it a crack watch the street below as I showered! However, the street below was a problem overnight because the Sorrento is 2 blocks from the Virginia Mason emergency room entrance where all the ambulances begin end. I was awakened by sirens all night long, this wasn't even over a weekend! That is the only negative aspect of our stay, but it's enough to keep me from going back. We ate in their restaurant which was outstanding. We frequently utilized their free shuttle service to the downtown area. It is also close enough to walk if you have the energy and time and aren't carrying a boatload of shopping bags. We did not need a car while we were there which meant we did not use the valet. The staff was outstanding in every encounter I had with them. The beds were great, the view isn't great, but the windows were large. And the interior of the hotel is just plain gorgeous. The coffee bar is very nice since we love French-pressed coffee there is a small frig in the room as well. I only wish it was in a quieter location. I booked this stay through booking.com and was pleased to find that this did not affect how we were treated at all.Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us. As you mentioned, we are located two blocks from the hospital, but by city ordinance, the ambulances are supposed to turn off their sirens when they are four blocks away. Please know that I will be following up with our local ambulance services about their compliance with this ordinance. Otherwise, I was pleased to see that you enjoyed your experience. We look forward to seeing you again soon! My best, Sam Johnson
We had a great stay at the Sorrento. Staff was excellent very helpful with suggestions and making reservations for meals, etc. . We stayed in a Queen Suite. It's and older hotel with only 76 rooms but that's the type of hotel we like to stay in. They have a car that will take you anywhere in the downtown area. Location is excellent. Very easy to get around. There's a bar restaurant plus more restaurants and bars within walking distance. we love this review! Thank you for such kind words. Appreciate the praise!Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
From the minute the car pulled up outside, I felt we were in for a treat. It is not a place for minimalist loving, clean lines types but if you want old world grandeur a cosy, shut out the world, maybe even a club feel then this is the spot. Great staff, good food, very comfortable ensuite bedroom. It was tempting not to leave the hotel at all (we did!) due to the heavy rain just curl up on the sofa in the Fireside Room with a book (we did that too!) A very contented few days!Thank you so much for you comments, Mayloughlin! We're so glad you appreciated our quirky coziness and our staff! We hope to welcome you back again soon.
I stayed at Hotel Sorrento for 6 nights in September. I loved the character and charm of this hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It was 5-star service, particularly with the friendly doormen always assisting and welcoming guests.The lobby and fireplace room are so cozy and atmospheric. Loved the wine hour they put on each evening. Drinks and breakfast were excellent, too. When the weather cooperated, we enjoyed sitting outside around the fire. The location was perfect, a quick jaunt to the main attractions and the convention center, but away from the hustle and bustle. It is a downhill walk to Pike Place Market and surrounds.. so we enjoyed walking down there, walking around, and then taking Uber back to the hotel once we were tired. Also enjoyed being a short walk to Capitol Hill. We loved that they changed the carpets in the elevator each day. Just another example of Sorrento's panache. Our room was clean, quiet, charming, and comfortable. Loved everything about this stay!The word panache is simply not used enough! We love it as a descriptive for the Sorrento! Thank you for all the lovely feedback, especially in regards to the service. Our team wants to relay how much they value our guests, and we are always happy when it shows. It sounds like you were able to enjoy the best of both worlds during your stay. The Fireside is such a wonderful space for when it is cold or dreary and the Garden and the fire pit is such a treat when the rain decides to stay away. We couldnt be happier that you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you again if you are in our neighborhood in the future!
I have stayed at a bunch of places in Seattle over the past 20+ years and my favorites have changed as staff, ownership, dating, maintenance, etc change. For years it was the Alexis then the Fairmont and Four Seasons then The Inn at the Market. the past few years we have stayed at the Hyatt but I thought I would try the Sorrento this weekend as I found a 249 suite deal. The rooms were huge and perfectly maintained and appointed. We loved having a book shelf filled with real books. The common areas were great and I honestly love a hotel where you can actually use the stairs anytime not just when the hotel is on fire. The staff was super friendly and helpful. This is our new favorite.Wow, parisryan, you know your Seattle hotels! I am thrilled that we are on the top of that prestigious list. Real books, real stairs, and super friendly staff, we have it all! Please come back and visit us again soon, we would be delighted to welcome you back. Cheers!Angie M. MykelGeneral Manager- Hotel Sorrento
This is the best Seattle hotel experience. The rooms and beds are so comfortable, in fact I purchased their pillow for home. This boutique hotel caters to your every whim and offers amenities and services you won't soon forget. The hotel is walking distance to everything the city has to offer.Thank you for your kind words! So glad you enjoyed our bedding, I forget how spoiled we are! Sleep tight.Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
So lucky we found this hotel on Trip Advisor. The decor was all wooden and very traditional (right up my husband's alley!). And it was very old school. . .in a good way. The staff was very helpful with all of our needs (and we had a couple special needs as my husband recently was in the hospital). Our room was great, bed super comfy, pillow choices, etc. Can't wait to get back to Seattle!Thank you so much for the kind words. I hope your husband is recovering quickly and I am glad that our staff was helpful in making him more comfortable. We hope to see you again, under more pleasant circumstances. Thank you!Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
Ehhh. It wasn't what we expected at all. The bar service was great, although very small. The room was really hot at night and the heater is really old. Not worth the price per night. One of the car hop workers were confusing and slightly rude but the rest of the staff was nice. Could be reminded about manners though.
My husband and I stayed at the Sorrento the night before leaving on and after returning from a cruise. So we got to see the hotel on a Friday and Saturday night a week apart.The staff was wonderful. When we arrived, they got our name from the luggage tags and were already getting us checked in before we even came in the hotel. The concierge was helpful in arranging scheduling the complementary town car service to the pier and area restaurants for us, as well as the dock for our cruise departure. They also picked us up when we returned.The hotel restaurant was good, though not exceptional. We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning and room service the other. Service was friendly.We were subject to a Sweet 16 party our 1st night in the hotel. We complained about the noise and when we returned for our 2nd night the next weekend, we were upgraded. We appreciated the gesture, however that weekend, a Bat Mitzvah was taking place. Also a very noisy occasion. So 2 young ladies enjoyed their big nights, while we did not.The hotel is lovely. The staff exceptional. Street noise is not a problem. Parties on the 7th floor - big problem. Great location - close enough to everything without being too close. The complementry car service is a big plus.
Classic old hotel, with friendly and attentive staff. Great location. This is not a new modern hotel, but one with warmth and personality. A delightful discovery. The only complaint is the slow wi-if.Thank you for your kind words. So glad you find our Hotel to be unique and our staff to be so attentive. Made our day. Randall Obrecht General Manager Sorrento Hotel
I'm a classic girl. When I travel, I usually stay in private clubs or five-star hotels, and studiously avoid the trendy. A friend raved about the Sorrento, which I'd heard about via its intriguing cultural programming and Night School series, and when some us suggested a weekend to meet up there, I thought I'd give it a go. More than anything, it reminded me of the hotels I like in Europe, the sort of family-owned, off-the-beaten-path but always in the best locations kind of places one only ever discovers through word of mouth. Well here's a little secret for you: in Seattle, stay at the Sorrento. There's even a charming little book in the room detailing its history, as a Belle Epoque refuge in a tranquil setting that became the place to take an apartment for wealthy local families during the Roaring '20s. Much of this enchanted ambiance remains. Highlights I enjoyed dinner in the Hunt Club, and the perfect cappuccino with the paper at breakfast the next day, a glass of wine by the fire in the main lounge, with its echoes of Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood, another of my favorites in the region (without the high-altitude dizziness here), curling up on six pillows on my bed to read in blissful silence with a view of a gargoyle standing guard on the roof outside, making a very civilized cup of tea in my room with Theo Chocolates from the well-stocked minibar... the list of memorable perfect touches goes on and on... I would encourage you to check in to the Sorrento and make your own. A perfect ten in my book it gets its own chapter.
A bit delayed in adding this review but we still have fond memories of the Sorrento. Everyone on the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The room was gorgeous - we were even upgraded to a suite - and service was impeccable. Highly recommend the Sorrento for business or personal trips.
Like I said, Service Service, Service, the old fashion way. We booked this on line and went off the reviews from Tripadvisor. The hotel is more incrediable in person. We happen to love the decor. The staff was over the top friendly and helpful. Someone said it was a noisy intersection, we didn't notice, our window faced the front of the hotel. The room was awesome, with a separate lounge area and bedroom. I felt like a queen in bed with all the down pillows, I was watching the Royals and waiting for the new prince to be born. I wish we could have stayed longer. We will be back if opportunity allows it. Thank you for your kind words! I agree, a perfect place to watch the Royal wedding! Hope you came down for afternoon tea. :)Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
My son lives in the neighborhood, so before I got to know the area, I initially visited the Sorrento for the convenience. I quickly realized what a remarkable place this is to stay. The service is outstanding, the rooms are quiet, beautiful, and comfortable, and the ambiance can't be beat. It is more expensive than other nearby places, but it is so worth it. We are so thankful for staying with us given your son's close proximity, I hope we will become you new home-away-from-home when visiting!Mike WestGeneral Manager
Close to everything, charming, classic, modern, elegant, w/achievement of service excellence. My go-to for every visit to Seattle. Expect a great experience with easy access (assuming you enjoy a nice walk) to everything the city has to offer.Make sure to pay attention to the mat in the hotel elevator each day - they've never missed a day.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your stay, and we are so please to hear that we are your go to hotel for your trips to Seattle! We look forward to welcoming you back again soon.
Just had another spectacular stay at my favorite hotel in Seattle the Sorennto. I was in town to attend the annual Bumbershoot festival, and I wouldnt dream of staying anywhere else. The level of service here is nothing short of stellar. I cant thank Lisa and her team enough for handling my myriad requests. And every department went out of their way to personally greet me during my stay which of course is no surprise because this hotel is truly a home away from home gem. Cant wait to come back!Dear Troy,Thank you taking the time to share your recent return visit to Hotel Sorrento, on TripAdvisor, with other travelers.I was delighted to read that enjoyed the Bumbershoot Festival and found our hotel and team top notch and successfully able to resource any requests that you had.No need to dream of any other location in Seattle, we want you back! Please allow us to coordinate your return visit and personally oversee any requests that you may have. Warmest regards.Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
I was very impressed with the Sorrento Hotel. The bed was covered in high quality pillows of varying firmness, the sheets were also high quality, and the comforter was similar to the Heavenly bed at Westin. Free high speed internet access was definitely a major plus, as were the free NY Times and Wall Street Journal in the lobby.Although their valet parking was expensive, there is plenty of metered on street parking in the area (meters not read from 6 pm to 8 am).My only complaint was that the room was somewhat small for a hotel of this quality. Although the square footage was probably about average, a lot of in was wasted on the long hallway in the room. The actual living area was somewhat cramped, especially when the pillows were removed from the bed. Still, I thought the hotel was an excellent value for the money, and I would definitely stay there again.
We spent one night at the Sorrento to attend a friend's event. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 3pm, but they got it together reasonably quickly and were suitably apologetic. Otherwise the service was attentive and personal. The hotel has old world charm and would make a good choice for a romantic weekend or quick business stopover. We didn't try the restaurant, but the food served at our event was excellent.Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay with us. I'm happy to read that our staff responded appropriately to the delayed check-in. I'm pleased to work with such a professional staff. I'm sorry to hear that you weren't able to dine in our restaurant during your stay. However, the excellent event meal you described was exactly what we aim in our Catering department. Our Executive Chef worked to create a catering menu that has functionality for large groups, but retains the quality you expect in a restaurant setting. So, in a way you were able to try some of our restaurant highlights! We hope you have a return stay planned, and that you'll be able to try out the actual restaurant. We'll be sure to have your table waiting. Cheers!Angie M. MykelGeneral ManagerWe hope to welcome you back soon and hopefully yo
Stayed two nights. Felt like they only cater to the rich and famous - that applies mainly to the front desk people and the one female staff member during the Hosted Wine Hour. The housekeeper on my floor, the restaurant gentleman at breakfast, and the valet gentleman were very nice.45.00 per night for valet parking! I realize parking is a premium in Seattle, but Wowie! The only other option is street parking (move it by 8AM) or metered lot across the street. Neither option desirable considering the known car thefts in the area. I hit the restaurant for breakfast only once. Over-priced, fair portions. Friendly gentleman served me. Not many people there at 8:00AM. Ate my protein bar for breakfast the next day instead. The hotel is OLD. The room was updated with modern amenities, including USB ports and plugs for gadgets, flat screen TV, fridge, modern shower fixture, over the sink lighting, free internet.The floor in my room creaked at every step. The room smelled musty. The windows do not block the sound well and one would not latch. Thank goodness for the room darkening curtains and my personal ear plugs! The HVAC was OK - did the job and was not loud. King Sized bed was comfy with lots of pillows. Noisy - The hotel is a couple of blocks from Swedish Hospital and Virginia Mason - hence sirens at various times of the night. Also note it IS in downtown Seattle a few blocks up from I-5.Nice walk in closet. Stocked honor-bar (very pricey! 8.00 for water!) . Save your money, walk 2 blocks up to Bartell Drugs for water and snacks. The bathroom is VERY small. You have to close the door to use the sink. The door will not stay open unless you block it with something. The light from the streets at night are very bright so you have to close the door. Definitely room for only one person. There is no counter space, unless you count the little shelf above the sink. When I mentioned the door at check out, she said we'll check on that. Yeah...right.Dear Neelee, Thank you very much for your honest feedback. At Hotel Sorrento we continue to improve and make upgrades that are meaningful to your Guests, your feedback is being used to prioritize these improvements. I do hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back again in the future so you can have an impeccable stay with us. Sincerely, Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, the team at the Sorrento makes you feel welcome and works to make sure you have everything you need. Everyone was kind and gracious. I loved that the rooms had a french press system with quality coffee and tea. The beds and bedding were very comfortable.
I love old hotels when they have been impeccably preserved like this one. The rooms are comfortable, everything works in the marble bathrooms, the staff is helpful and friendly. The new owners seem to be trying to relax a little of the stuffiness without sacrificing the elegance, and they are doing a good job. The location on Pill Hill makes it convenient for doctor visits. Be sure to ask for their medical rate. The restaurant is good, but you can also go across the street to the Corner Cafe for breakfast or lunch, or down one block to the popular Vito's for dinner.This old dame is quite a charmer! I'm glad you appreciate all the work that has gone into keeping her as beautiful as the day she opened! Yes, we're definitely about being upscale, not uptight. Glad you felt that. I'll be sure to pass along your feedback to our new management.Hope to see you again soon!Angie M. MykelGeneral ManagerHotel Sorrento
The Sorrento is a wonderful hotel! Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are quite comfortable. They offer valet parking. We enjoyed drinks in the Dunbar Room and breakfast the next morning. We stay at the Sorrento whenever we are in Seattle.Thank you for your continued support and patronage of Hotel Sorrento! It is always so nice to hear from our regular guests and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Mike West General Manager
This place has mostly construction workers and some other kinds of guests I care not to name...If you are looking for a place kind of on the questionable side this is the place for you..There always seemed to be something going on...
Older property, clean room, clean linen. Think Motel 6. Hunting, fishing, traveling hard, bachelors - save some money and stay here. Water tasted like it had a trace of paint thinner in it, but that's probably East KY these days - careless fracking and mountain-top removal going on. No highway or train noise - the hotel is up a quiet... More
Contemporary hotel. Great concept. Rooms weren't ready until after 5 due to hotel being full w/ concert goers. Other than that small glitch, was a great hotel to stay at. Parking was easy w/ garage across from hotel. Overnight parking 18 or hotel valet at around 22-25. Within walking distance of downtown restaurants and bars.
We stayed here for the Thunder festival and the location was so ideal. We were also fortunate to have one of the rooms facing the river. The staff was very friendly and the room was beautiful. And the bed was sooo comfortable - which I've found to be a standard feature at a Starwood hotel. I would definitely stay here... More
Modern loft vibe, with convenient built-ins, Bliss toiletries, comfy bed, and open lobby with lots of seating for drinking and eating. We were in town for Springstein concert and YUM center was only two blocks away. East valet parking and easy on/off interstate. We will definitely stay again!
It served the purpose of being close to the airport. Other than that, not much good to say. Very dated, loud heater that made it hard to sleep, awful towels. Had the creeps all night. Housekeeping did as good as they could with old used-up rooms.
The manager kept changing rates without notice during my stay. Questionable business ethics. Only cereal and coffee for breakfast. Noisy except in rear rooms, which are not used in winter. Poor maid service.

I stayed here for two nights and although it is not fancy, it was adequate. The bed was very comfortable. Even though it was on the highway, I could hear no highway noise. My room had a mini-refrigerator and a coffee pot with coffee pods. The bathroom could stand a little TLC but it wasn't bad. It had hot water,... More

There are few motels in the area unless you want to stay in Richmond so I stayed here. Very basic, no frills but clean enough and quiet. No breakfast but there is some dining nearby. There was no comfortable chair provided in the room.
I usually dont write reviews but in this case feel like i need to Warn others... We booked a non smoking room on line. The Place looked nice from outside... but room we got reeked with smell of cigarretts! Complained about it and was told that no rooms to trade was given a can of room deodorizer..Needless to say...

I recently stayed at this Motel 6 on a trip to the area. The motel had easy access to both Highways, was quite, comfortable, allowed pets for no additional charge, and was a great price to stay. The room was small, but was packed with amenities and had enough room for me to pop up a dog kennel inside. Lots... More
I had never stayed at any Motel 6 before, so my wife and I were a bit apprehensive. It may not actually be located in Big Bear Lake. I believe that it's just over the line in Big Bear City. My GPS couldn't find the address in BBL, so you may want to punch in BBC. The location may be... More
Everything about the OB Hotel is fantastic. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable. The balcony we had was great and had an awesome view of the ocean, the beach, the end of Newport...the whole scene. The staff was courteous and prompt. We were even able to check in a few hours early. Parking, while a bit tight, is right on site - a welcome feature in OB. What a great spot in a great town! Go and enjoy this wonderful hotel and all the area has to offer...
A simple nice hotel for the money. Nothing fancy, but it will do considering the price and location. I would stay there again. A little street noise, but not nearly as bad as I expected from its location right by the street. Great value.
Very nicely appointed small room, but acceptable lodging for the price when spending the day away from the Motel wine tasting. Very small outdoor swimming pool (probably smallest out door pool have ever seen -- even smaller than indoor pool at Best Western Plus in Albany, Oregon -- another guest had stayed many times at this Motel for business, and commented he had never seen anyone in the pool. But, when there to dine and visit wineries without children, swimming pool irrelevant. But families with children who want to play in the pool, or adults that want to swim some laps be advised that this is not the Motel swimming pool for you. Good, adequate complimentary breakfast (2 choices) with coffee or tea at Denny's next door. Had not experienced this arrangement before, and was certainly nicer and more convenient than the 5.00 credit given by Adelaide Inn in Paso Robles, CA, at expensive for breakfast restaurant located two blocks away from Motel.Thank you for your review. Yes our pool is on the small side, but we have a large area to lounge and soak up the sun. We are glad you enjoyed our arrangement with Denny's for our rewards members.
This little hotel on the outskirts of town is a gem! Clean, comfortable and friendly! The rooms are large, and the staff was very efficient. We would definitely stay here again when we come wine tasting!Thank you for your great review and we are glad you had a fun time! See you on your next trip to the beautiful Napa Valley.
Interestingly, the only vines you will see here are a few sad ones that grow around the edge of the parking lot. The location is ok for doing winery tours as you have access to the major Napa and Sonoma routes. The room was clean but the place was noisy. We had a room with a connecting door to another room and you could hear anything/everything through it from our bathroom. Lots of walking around noises from above as well. If I stayed there again I'd go for the top floor and make sure it wasn't a joined room.
Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. We have always been a Best Western and have just gone through a 100 remodel of our property I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.
The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.
At the southern end of the Village of Napa, it is easy access to Napa and the valley. Very clean, and very comfortable. Quiet pool area. Breakfasts from Denny's is a nice feature. The have winery coupons which allow 2 for 1.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay!
A huge thank you to Nicole, who was super efficient in finding a group of badly prepared friends, Wineries that stay open after 4pm at 15h50!!!! She was not phased at all, went online and found some AMAZING options within 10 minutes drive from the hotel. This is the hotel you want to stay in if you want to visit wineries that are still open after 4pm. The hotel rooms were huge with loads of space and big beds. More importantly there is a hot tub and pool that closes at 10pm. So after a day in the sun, it is a fantastic option. The hotel has a Denny's attached but also an iHOP within 2 minutes walk across the road. However, the hotel offers a substantial breakfast 'snack' of yogurt, cereal bars, fruit, tea, coffee and juice. Again, thank you Nicole for your professionalism, beautiful smile and calm approach! Thank you for your feedback! We appreciate your business and hope to see you again!
Very nice staff! We used our Best Western Rewards points to obtain a free night's stay. They upgraded us to a two story suite! Very special. Room was spotless and everything was in perfect working order. The entire facility is well maintained and safe. While we were on a busy highway through town, there was no noise in our room. A substantial breakfast is provided at the Denny's adjacent to the hotel. Across the street is ample shopping, and there is a Starbucks nearby. We will stay here again.We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we were able to upgrade you to the suite. The perks of being a BW Rewards member.
Great property! Wonderful beds! Upgraded furnishings in room 309. Good location to everything. Very quiet. Staff was friendy welcoming. I booked this hotel via the 800 and the gentlemen was super friendly and helpful. Rate was 107/night, which for Napa Christmas week was a very good value. If you sign up for the Best Rewards program you get coupons for breakfast at Denny's which was on property. Even it had an upscale feeling to it. No complaints whatsoever about this hotel experience!Thank you for your review of our property. I am glad you had a great time.
The hotel was noisey during the night with people coming and going knocking on doors and people walking around all night long. I could not reccommend staying there. The internet was not working and there was no attempt to get it fixed. Some tall black guy walking around minding everyones business.
While the room itself was clean enough, with newly renovated bathrooms, it stank of Lysol, and since I would not advise leaving the windows open, given the homeless people and drug addicts who wander around the open halls here, the rooms can be quite stuffy. But the problem is less the room, but rather the kinds of people that management allow to stay in the rooms. We stayed next door to Room 29 which is blatantly a brothel with people coming and going all night, and I even got solicited one night for some fun by a prostitute in the parking lot. Random people knocking on our door at 5am, smashing bottles outside the door, people arguing and fighting in the middle of the night. Rows of homeless people sleeping around the sides of the building. While they do have a security guard who wanders around, he does not do very much. The area is not dangerous per se, as we would come back for nights out on the town late at night and no one bothers you walking the streets as long as you mind your business. I could go on, but do yourself a favor, and dig into you pocket, pay a few dollars more, and stay away from this place. That way, you can actually enjoy your stay in SF.
We know people start a motel to make money .... but this is crazy !! The guy who helped us was very nice to us, nothing wrong there ... we got the room via booking.com ( bastards) the room looked okay at first ... pretty clean, a bit old, but okay ... but after our first night we had red little spots on our bodies ...we thought we had mosquito bites, but after another night we knew it were BedBugs ... we looked it up later on .... and we knew it cam from the bed .... what a bummer .... !!
Our window was broken, luckily we were on the third floor but it got very cold, and the heat had only one setting which was 80 so then we got heated out, heard sirens all night and loud cars, and they wouldnt move us to another room. Phone didnt work so each time we had a problem we had to walk all the way over to the office. Needles and homeless people all over the stairways. Elevator smelled of urine so bad we could never take it. No hot water, and very low water pressure. It was in downtown SF in which is another story, of course tons of homeless sleeping everywhere around the hotel. Lobby workers very rude and uncaring.
we booked this hotel and they told us we could cancel our reservation 24 hours before the stay.i read the reviews and saw the hotel was bad. So i canceled. They said there was no cancelation policy. So I canceled my credit card. But then I found out that the charge went through.
We stayed in this hotel with my father, who was coming to SF for a medical appointment. I booked the room online for 2, no charge in advance. It was very hectic and stressful trip for us, so appreciated very friendly and helpful staff. When we were checking in we couldnt get the CC thru, they let us stay with a promise we would take care of it next afternoon after we get off the hospital. We had a booking for 2 days, but we decided to go home after first night since we were alreaady done with our business in SF, they didnt even charge us cancelling fee. The room was ok, I would say it is perfect for people who only need a place to crash out- cant beat it for the price and location.Come on guys, you are in SF there are homeless people EVERYWHERE
The biggest problem of this hotel is the location, the hotel itself is not that bad. It is clean in general, rooms are very tiny, it doesn't have a fridge and microwave. So basically that's a fine place to sleep, have shower and not more than this. So, If you plan just to sleep in that hotel several nights, it is fine. The hotel can't be blamed, that the district is full of homeless, hookers, drug dealers and junk. However, that district it still in historical part of the city and very close to the Market St and the tram lines.
I am so sad I did not see the ratings for this place before I made 2 nights reservation. My family and I rented 3 rooms and what a mistake! One room had dirty sheets and we had to ask twice before they came and changed them. The maids did not seem happy about the ekstra work and for them where sheets with stains are apprently clean sheets no matter what. They even started to argue about it with my husband!The cable tv was not working proberly and the channels we could recieve was not even the same in all 3 room even though they where located right next to each other. Many of the channels kept on freezeing both the picture and the sound.No airconditioner in any of the rooms. The surrounding area seem quite dodgy, particuly at the back of motel. The homepage promise free high speed internet in all the rooms, but ups! That only works in the lobby! The beds are exstreamly small even acording to european standard! There are no refrigeater in the rooms. The window in the bedroom are plainted over with white paint so people can't look in, but several spots are free of paint and there are no curtain.Buttom line: I'm NEVER comming back again to this place!
The hotel room and bathroom were clean. No smoke odor or any other odor. Sheet and towers were clean. Everything work in my room (TV, lights, heater). My room was for one person really. They have bigger room too. For the price this is a nice hotel and close to must of the attractions (walking distant).TV work fine. It only have a table and a chair only, the bed and to night stand.Be careful if you park in the back of the hotel, take anything that will attract the attention. There are lot on homeless etc... but they won't bother you. I was walking late at night (2AM) with no problem. The room with the ice and soda machine was close. But they are around place to buy ice an anything else. Subway restaurant is across the street and lots if Vietnamese restaurants in the block. If you want a fancy hotel, this one if not for you. This is for people that will be out all day and return to take a shower and go sleep and watch tv while relaxing.
Please DO NOT book this place. As soon as I got there, I felt scared. However, I couldn't leave because I couldn't find an affordable place due to a convention going on. I thought that I would spend all day doing tourist stuff, and just come here to sleep, but it was a nightmare! There are a bunch of homeless people, drunk, high, suspicious etc around the area. I'm from a country with the highest crime in the World and I have been in many cities, but I have never felt so scared. There are trash bags in the stairs and they smell like pee. The rooms smell like weed and smoke furthermore, the smell of cleaning chemicals were worst. I didn't see bed bugs however, there were hairs in the sheets. It feels like they never changed them. The shower didn't work. I heard two men next to our bedroom having loud sex. I saw 3 transsexual men in the room downstairs in underwear. People tried to get in our room several times therefore, I put the table against the door. If you have family, don't even think about staying here.
a very average place to stay, but I am a very budget conscious traveler and and dont mind to save on a hotel to spend in other places, such as shopping at nearby downtown San Francisco!With in walking distance from Union Square and all the attractions restaurants and night lifethe city has to offer. NO WIFI in the rooms
Room was super clean, bed was great. Now the not so great stuff. Bathroom was like the inside of a cave. One weak light, barely enough to see what you're doing. Shower needs to be redone as floor was badly chipped and looked super bad....More
This hotel is just spectacular! The staff is friendly and he service is phenomenal. The rooms are spacious with incredible views. Rooms have floor to ceiling windows. Its a small boutique hotel with lots of Meeting space and a great restaurant.
The lobby and staff were very nice, but once you leave downstairs it is run down, has an old dcor, and smells far from pleasing. The rooms are tiny, and we asked to be switched to another room because the air conditioning unit was so loud. The 2nd room was equally as bad. I work in the hospitality industry and would never recommend this hotel to anyone.Hi Zanzibella - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us. While our rooms are cozy in nature, as Chicago's first Silver LEED certified hotel we're proud of our eco-friendly efforts. We appreciate your candid feedback about some items not being to standards in the room, such as the air conditioning. We will certainly ensure these types for things are checked daily so as not to occur again. We hope to welcome you back in the future.
This hotel is decent, but not perfect if you are on the picky side. Pretty design sinks that are a hassle to use, not enough hanging spaces for towels, broken elevators, etc.... The staff is great, helpful and super friendly. Overall, a satisfying hotel.Hi nelliebenoit - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us. We are happy to learn that you enjoyed your stay, and that our helpful staff was able to assist you. The depth of the sink is designed to conserve water in keeping with our eco-friendly policies. We appreciate your candid feedback about some items not being to standards, such as the elevators. Thank you again for visiting us and we hope to see you soon.
Decent hotel won on price line, rooms are extremely small. Staff was good. Location was OK at best.. Would rather pay more to be closer to the action and bigger rooms. Probably would pass on price line as well.Hi winks1996 - Thank you for choosing Hotel Felix for your recent visit to Chicago. While our rooms are cozy in nature, as Chicago's first Silver LEED certified hotel we're proud of our eco-friendly efforts. Thank you for posting your review and we hope to see you again soon.
I stayed two nights at Hotel Felix - the room was a bit small but the bed was large and comfortable. The lighting in my room was at the end of the bed, so the far end of the room was a little dim, I had to turn the desk lamp on to see my suitcase. Also, some of the spotlights in the ceiling above the bed were not aligned with their hole (they had come loose and left a gap) which didn't help the lighting situation. The rest of the room was ok for a short stay but any longer and it could be a little uncomfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful and it's ideally located. You're only a few minutes walk from the L train stations. The bar and restaurant options in the hotel are quite limited - you have to go next door to the local bar for a drink and the lobby doubles as a sushi bar. I'd recommend if you're in town for a short stay or business but not for a longer visit.Hi Knoggers - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our urban location, and that our friendly staff was able to assist you. We appreciate your feedback and we hope to see you again soon. Safe travels.
Hotel Felix is in the heart of the Chicago action, minutes away from the Miracle Mile, great restaurants and the lake front. Found an amazing deal on line which made this affordable. Room was very small but clean and nice. Hotel staff courteous and friendly.Hi Mark C - Thank you for posting your review. We are glad you had a great stay with us and that the location was enjoyable for you. We appreciate your kind remarks about our staff. Thank you again and we hope to see you soon!
As Stash members we received a quiet room as requested on an upper floor away from the elevators. There was a musty odor to our tiny room that was otherwise clean and bright white when we entered. Toiletries are by L'Octane. Electrical outlets are adequate. Coffee and tea are served in the lobby in the morning. I was a little put off when a transient person walked in, used the lobby restroom, came out and made inquiries about jobs then proceeded to hang out talking loudly on a personal phone call. The staff seemed uncomfortable dealing with the situation.Hi VaporK8 - Thank you very much for posting your review. We appreciate your feedback, and we have shared your comments with our team. Thank you again for visiting us and we hope to see you soon.
I stayed at the Hotel Felix for a week and had no complaints. Although not a chain hotel, they still offered complimentary tea and coffee in the mornings. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. It was an overall pleasant stay and there is no reason that I wouldn't return.Hi madeinukeng - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our complimentary, fair-trade coffee and tea in the lobby every morning, and that our friendly staff was able to assist you. Thank you again for visiting us and we hope to see you soon.
Stayed back at the felix from 2nd-7th march 2011, thank you so much to Kristina Zakaryan for sorting out my reservation. the staff are so helpful, the doormen even more so. julian was cool, + the other guy (he had an english mum) was so helpful.Once again, my king room was huge, i was given a room that was adjusted for wheelchair users so i guess i had extra space. Great TV, great bed, beautiful lobby, a really nice place to chill in the morning with a free coffee.WIFI is free and very fast, clean, crisp, modern hotel, what more could you ask for...except maybe having a tea/coffee maker in the roomthanks Felix, we'll meet again, dont know where, dont know when......
Just got back from a two night stay at Hotel Felix and have no complaints. Check in went smooth and every employee we encountered were very friendly and helpful.Yes, the rooms are very small, but they were extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. We weren't there to spend alot of time in the room. I will say that the sink was the most shallow that I have ever used, but like some people said, the place is very hip.You can spend an extra 100 a night to get a bigger room and fancier hotel, but it was just fine for us and would definitely consider staying there again.
A lot of the posted reviews are negative because of the smallness of the rooms. Ok people, the whole concept about boutique hotels are that they are small, unique with their usage of limited space and fairly reasonable because of it. If your principle concerns to have a large spacious luxury suite, than the Hilton millennium is down Michigan ave and will cost you at least 4 times the price. Then you can complain about the high cost of staying in Chicago. The Felix is located just 4 short blocks west of the Magnificent Mile and about a 15 minute stroll to the Navy Pier. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We arrived at just about noon and our room was ready. It was clean and fresh and the bed was very comfortable. There are numerous restaurants all around the facility and the area feels very safe. There is complimentary coffee and tea every morning and their is a small bar with limited times and services available.Overall we found our stay very comfortable and made our weekend in the Windy City a very enjoyable one.Hi Bolte59 - Thank you very much for posting your review. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our urban location central to dining, shopping and more and that our helpful staff was able to assist you. Thank you again for your kind remarks feedback. We hope to see you again when you return to Chicago. Safe travels.
This place it out there in the woods. It is a bit hard to find. The location is very quite. It feels peaceful and secluded. However also maybe a bit creepy for the squeamish hearted. The place is pretty rustic with some hunting trophies on the wall and some dust and grime here and there. Not really sweet romantic getaway... More
Situated right on the Chinatown gates, Astoria is perfectly located. A few blocks from the muni the cable cars, bart within 1 block but the hotel itself is terrible but it's very cheap. The whole place needs a refurb something doing about the smell which lingered in the corridor room.I found the bed comfy but won't be in a rush to go back. We were also lucky to receive complimentary pubes in the bathroom on arrival.
I've stayed here at the Astoria Hotel every time I've visited The City except once and I've been visiting on a regular basis since 1986-1987. I stayed once at the Olympic Hotel on Mason Street near the Hilton and the Marriott off of O'Farrell St. The Olympic was on par with the Astoria but was bought out by the Art Institute for dorm space or whatever so it's been the Astoria ever since. I guess if I was a Hilton, Marriott or Hyatt kind of guy I wouldn't mind throwing away 200-250/night just for a place to sleep. Not to compare the two properties obviously but there are many more ways to spending your hard earned vacation money there in San Francisco as any other expensive locale. But maybe I have it all wrong which is a distinct possibility. What is it they say about real estate: location, location, location... At the corner of Grant and Bush next to the Chinatown gate, you couldn't ask for a more convenient location. And for you Starbucks junkies, there's one across the street. And it's cheap and that's one word you'll never hear associated with San Francisco. I guess when I can book r/t airfare and 7 nights at the luxurious Astoria for much less than 1,000, I shouldn't complain. I never pay full fare and if I think rates are high I just won't go, simple as that. But a few simple amenities wouldn't hurt. Like, for instance maybe a couple of microwaves in the community room on the second floor so the guests can warm up some leftover restaurant food or even warm up a cup of coffee for heaven's sake. Don't know how much it would cost to Wi-Fi each floor but the community room has it but I'm sure most guests would prefer the privacy of their own rooms. The breakfast items served on the second floor daily works for something on the run. And how about some vending machines and ice machines. We're not asking the owners to break the bank here but I've talked to a front desk person there who has mentioned these type of amenities to the owners for years and has had no response.But then again who do you think is going to absorb the costs of these added amenities and renovations. Their loyal customers like myself. Maybe if some of us took our business elsewhere they'd get the message. Probably not. Food for thought Astoria Hotel. Is anybody listening there.. I must give a shout out to the hard working housekeeping staff. They do a heck of a job and at least my room has always been clean, or let's say clean enough. And maybe add a few more channels and upgrade the TV's and make sure all the remotes work. Just saying...
While this place is relatively inexpensive, it isn't worth the savings! As soon as we walked in, we noticed the room smelled like urine. There was no remote for the tiny television, the towels looked worn and unclean, the mattress was as hard as a rock, there is no ventilation (no ac, no fan) in the room and there are no screens on the windows. The worst part was that we were attacked by mosquitoes all night! The tub didn't drain properly (while I was showering, I was standing in several inches of water) and the bath mat for the outside of the tub was a piece of paper! It is a shame because it is obviously a hotel that has been in SF for a long time, and could be charming if the owners took better care of it. We will never stay here again.
we stayed here for 6days,its in a good location,right at the gates of china town and trendy places to eat at,but it is old and the rooms need up dating,
The room was basic but clean, quite old fashioned and needs updating but the bed was comfortable enough and we got a quiet nights sleep where we were on the 7th floor. The room was cleaned each morning and fresh towels given. The free buffet breakfast was good, loads of different kinds of bagels, chocolate muffin/cakes, toast, eggs, cereal, tea and coffee. The bagels were the best i've tasted!! The breakfast room was very small and just a kitchen really but was nice and gave me that travelling vibe whilst i made and ate my toast alongside Germans, French and Dutch fellow travellers. One thing i did not like about the hotel was the lift!!! By the second day i was taking the stairs! All 7 flights of them...! The lift is tiny, very scary and just felt like it was about to go at any second! The hotel is situated right next to the Chinatown gateway which is a great location. 5-10 minute walk to Union Square and the main shopping area. One day we walked to the Coit Tower from the hotel and then kept on walking down to Fishermans Warf, if you look at the map you will see we covered some distance but in my opinion - its the best way to explore around. We even walked all the way back!!I was pleased with our stay, for the low price we paid we got a comfortable bed to sleep in, clean bathroom, free breakfast and it was in walking distance for pretty much everything we needed.
I stayed for over a week. You get what you pay for, but it was fine where I stayed (5th Floor). For 56/night (taxes incl), close to everything, and away from the seedier parts of downtown, it's a pretty good deal.They don't change the sheets every day, but do you change your bed sheets every day at home I believe they change every 3 or 4 days, but you have to ask them.I didn't see any bed bugs. But I took precautions, just in case. I kept things off the floor, and I put a big clear plastic garbage bag around my suitcase. And I brought double-sided tape to use as bug trap if I needed it (which I didn't).The breakfast, if you chose to buy the breakfast tickets for 4, consisted of toast, bagels, milk, juice, boiled eggs, and a chocolate snack (all bought from Costco).There is WiFi, but you have to go into this big room on the second floor to get it - no big deal.If you need some deals or ideas of what to do, in the lobby, you will see a rack full of brochures. Some of those brochures have coupons in it for restaurants or ideas on what to do in SF.Yes, you don't get the quality of service in a 4 or 5 star hotel, but you get what you pay for. It's either a one-star (if you take the shared bathroom) versus the two-star (private bathroom) facility.I would recommend this place to people who aren't fussy and who don't have high expectations.
Pros- Very good location- Newly renovated- Clean rooms and fully equiped baths- Comfortable for business trips- Good internet connectionCons- The smell, I noticed it in many hotels similar to this one (but you get used to it)- If you get a room with the view to the street, it is very noisy (the windows are very old)- You cannot pay online, and if your company pays for you, make sure all the papers are signed in advance- The furniture and the beds are old
Clean comfortable room, accommodating staff, only a few complaints- room a bit cramped for 2 beds, street noise on front side and low water pressure in sink. Other than that, would recommend for overnight or long term stay.
This was a great find. It was in a good location. Everything was in a good distance! We like to walk so it was perfect! Rooms were newly refurbished! Basic but perfectly clean and fine! Comfortable bed. Perfect for us we enjoyed or stay so thank you! Dear Kaylrd,Thank you for staying with us at Greenwich Inn. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed our convenient location and newly renovated rooms. Please think of us again when booking your next trip to San Francisco!Warmest Regards,Greenwich Inn
Stayed here for 3 nights whilst visiting San Francisco . Great location everything within walking distance. Rooms lovely they have just been re furbished with everything you need coffee facilities/iron/hairdryer etc . Continental breakfast available in reception which you can take back to your room.Free parking but spaces are limited. Reasonably priced for San Francisco would recommend.Hi Kevin, Our location is definitely one of the fantastic things about our hotel. We are so lucky to have a property in the heart of San Francisco, and which is so convenient for so many of the city's attractions. We are delighted that our hotel seems to have been so suitable for your needs, and we hope that you will stay with us again when you are next in town. Best wishes, Hotel Management
Dirty sensation. Carpet full of cigarrettes holes. Very old and used. Very noisy AC. Free parking. Thick walls, you listen your neighbourgs snoring. The are is nice, bacause you have some bars around and the neighbouhood is suitable. Near Fillmore Street (genuine american, San Francisco Street, full of live, no tourists).If your budget is low, and you are not very ambitious with the room, is one the cheapest way to stay in SF. Leave you lugage and go to visit the city.
The hotel is simply horrible, dirty, smelly and noisy beyond belief. The sheets have not been changed when we booked the room and mould and dirt were 'dripping' out of the extractor in the bathroom. Even for 100 a night it was a torture. I stayed in the area a few years ago in the Ramada hotel which is now unfortunately closed, the hotel was simply lovely. While searching for a similar hotel, Greenwich Inn appeared, I don't know what I was thinking booking it..
Easy to walk to various points of interest and neighbourhood felt safe and friendly. Lots of restaurants nearby. Free parking and relatively cheap rates. A good base for a few days in San Fran.
Don't let the outside looks fool you! This might be a motel kinda of place but the owners did a fantastic job renovating it to today's standards. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. As we got there late evening, they helped me locate a parking spot within the property. (review of parking to follow so keep reading)We got a 2 queen room and it was much bigger than I expected. There was plenty of room to roam around without feeling cramped. Everything was clean and well appointed: big flat screen TV, microwave and fridge, coffee maker, iron, closet. Beds and pillows were very comfy. There were also TONS of outlets (including usb) to charge all your electronics. Bathroom was just the the best. It is an open tiled bathroom with the most amazing water pressure ever. It felt like getting a massage in the shower! They offered a light breakfast but we didn't try it. Plenty of really good restaurants less than 5 min walk away with a lot of choices (italian, japanese, brunch, veg/vegan, chinese, mexican, you name it.) Although parking is free at this hotel, the parking lot is limited and a bit tight which can be unnerving if you drive a big truck. We were lucky to get the last parking spot on our first night (it looked like they were sold out and parking lot was full) But did I say it was free :) Just park the car and take the bus. There is a bus stop less than 5 minute walk away. It was a 20 min ride to the Wharf and also 15 mins to Golden Gate Bridge Visitor Center.On the down side, it can get noisy as it is just off the street and you can hear cars pass by. It didn't bother us too much though and we still got a good night sleep. If you are light sleeper, just be aware. What a lovely review! Thank you for taking the time to go into so much detail to demonstrate how happy you were. You had the experience that we want to provide for each and every one of our guests! We are delighted that our property was such a wonderful match for your accommodation requirements, and we hope to welcome you back again soon! Best wishes, Hotel Management
Extremely satisfied with my stay here as we were looking for a place to stay last minute. The room was well worth the price - clean and modern with lots of space. There is free parking available too which is extremely convenient. Ricky at the front desk was very helpful and answered any questions we had. Would definitely stay here again.Thank you for your wonderful feedback - we are thrilled that you had such a wonderful experience with us, and that our hotel was so suitable for your needs and expectations. We appreciate your review, and are delighted that you intend to stay with us again we are very much looking forward to welcoming you back. Best wishes, Hotel Management
Stayed here for 6 days. Location is very good, right in the marina and cow hollow area which has many good restaurants and bars. MUNI stops right around the corner. The hotel and room are pretty run down. Old and and show signs of wear and tear. Tv made a weird noise. No AC, just heater(which also makes noise). Beds are ok. Bathroom is nice. The cleaning staff does daily cleaning of the room. For the kind of price paid, I didn't have high expectations, plus it was just a place to crash at night so overall it worked out. Area can sometimes be noisy due to the fire station being around the corner and bar/restaurant patrons walking the surrounding streets. If you are a light sleeper maybe some earbuds would be good. Overall: it's a budget hotel that shows its age and wear and tear. The location is very good and feels safe. If you are looking for a place to just sleep in, are not too picky about a room and don't have much money to spend in a nicer hotel then this would work for you.
This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Beware of room 20. This is the room with the weird vent on the door. So noisy and cold because you can't close it. Holes in sheets. Grimy, old and dirty. You are desperate if you stay here.
A great location right off Lombard street. They are in the process of of remodeling, so the rates will probably be going up. The rooms have big TVs, tiled showers, hair dryers, very nice beds, everything is new. The rooms do not have refrigerators, ice buckets, or mini-shampoo. Dear Ralph B,Thank you for your four star rating and many compliments. We hope we made such a good impression that you will continue to stay with us whenever you visit the area. We look forward to welcoming you back soon.Thank you,Greenwich Inn
Stayed there on 18/19 September 2004. Rooms are simple but clean. Area has good selection of restaurants and bars and an especially good cafe for breakfast, Home Plate on Lombard opposite the Ihop. It is noisey due to traffic and poor insulation, but was good location for travelling around. Fishermans Wharf is about 15 minutes walk and the no. 30 MUNI can be caught on Chestnut.
Like staying at your grans house but your gran stays on the main bus line to town.That is all you need to know, oh and you don't really like your gran that much.BUT i have to write 200 characters which is a bit silly to be honest so ill just comment on how 200 characters is a bit silly until it accepts that some places only need reviewed with a sentence or two.
Good hotel, really good bed.Hotel is doing work to renew it.Parking is a little small and you are close to the road, so expect to be wake up early.But if are visiting San Francisco it might not be a bad thing.Reception is a little awkward when the hotel is doing the work, its in a room, so you are not sure if its a reception or if its someone room.Thank you for your review. We appreciate your understanding whilst we are finishing our renovations, and we hope that you will return when everything is finished, so that you can experience our wonderful, fresh product. We really hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back! Best wishes, Hotel Management
I am from Miami and used to go to the Sand Bar lounge (which is no longer there) when a lot younger. This accommodation is what you would expect from a motel of the 50's. Clean enough, terrazzo floors, and furnishings were just barley suitable. Over all (considering rate) we enjoyed. Beach front and nice pool.
This was our second visit to this beautiful resort. It's island decor, accommodations and relaxed environment are wonderful. Beach views spectacular! Unfortunately our visit was cut short because of Hurricane Irma but management and staff support and consideration were truly appreciative. Will definitely return!
I had the Lincoln Suite again. I will always request that suite when I am going to be staying there. The Jacuzzi is great and the bed is comfortable. I am told that it is the most requested room in the Hotel.
The room was clean, the bed was decent, and there were plenty of towels. The place wasn't too fancy (hence the 4 stars) but if you're looking for a place to crash, it will do the trick. The staff was nice as well! It's a bit of a walking distance from downtown which is actually up a pretty decent hill.... More
We stayed here for 2 nights and the women at the desk were wonderful. We got there on a Tuesday evening only to find out that most everything in town was closed as it wasn't season yet. The desk clerk was so helpful telling us what she thought would be open and gave us copies of menus to help us.... More
The staff is truly willing to serve and meet your every need. The rooms were probably the cleanest I've stayed in, in any hotel. Conveniently located near the mall, other shopping eateries, freeways and Fresno City College.Dear Happy Guest - Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers. I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as much as you enjoyed your stay. Take care!
The room was covered in boxwood beetle bugs, both dead and alive. While I understand there was an infestation in Ridgecrest, I would think the cleaning staff would be sure to vacuum at least the dead ones and attempt to get rid of the live ones. I told the office staff and they were nice, but just repeated that there... More
You can't expect much for 50, however our room was clean, although the furnishing are well worn. The bathroom was large and AC worked. The area attracted homeless folk which may put guests at ill-ease. Doors did triple lock.
In the past, Motel 6 has not been on my hotel radar. I went a couple times when I was a kid and all I remember from those trips is smokey-smelling , musty rooms, with broken and/or outdated furniture and beds I didn't want to put my suitcase on, let alone sleep in. Fast forward to today and a lot... More
I was hesitant because of some of the negative reviews. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Our room was clean and the staff was friendly enough. It was admittedly loud (our room faced Polk St) but bring some earplugs and you should be fine. It's walking distance to Union Square and Polk Street has a bunch of bars if you're into that. The surrounding area is a bit rough but most people won't bother you.
We were in San Francisco for 6 days, and we stayed at the Monarch.They were nice enough to check us in early,but the room had a slight smell and a view of the apartment that was 10 feet away. The bed was clean,but the pillows really really flat,and I am not a pillow person.It was cold in the room so bring warm socks(this was in Aug), warm pajamas and a pillow.The washrooms were clean and the bathtub deep.The safe did not work and if the temp.outside was hot,we would be in trouble,because it the AC was missing knobs.The tv had 15 channels and HBO( a few great movies).The Wi-Fi worked and the morning coffee was good. The biggest problem was that the area was loud at night with the homeless and druggies talking/yelling until 1am.In the morning the homeless were very visable and at night,I would not want to be coming in late if you are on your own. SO the hotel it self is worth the savings,but the area I something to really really consider and I am a city girl.Stay in little Italy or near the Warf,these are the cleaner and safer areas. Enjoy your time in San Francisco!
We booked here for a week months ago. As our cruise dates changed, we emailed our cancellation notice. We received confirmation of the cancellation and was shocked to find out that our Visa was charged the first night despite the fact that we had cancelled a week prior to our arrival.Our Visa company is now trying to recuperate our funds, but no reputable hotel would be so underhanded. ALL attempts to communicate the management/owners of the hotel has been to no avail.Do NOT book here unless you are 100 sure, do not risk it. We're out over 100 US but it's the principle of it that hurts us more than the money! Shysters!
I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews but I found the Monarch to be very comfortable. The rooms were clean and the linens were fresh. Our room was always cleaned by the maid service prior to 11am. The staff also was very helpful in getting cabs, shuttles, and directions. Also I wanted to let people know that this is a big city neighborhood. There are homeless people in the neighborhood asking for change, but you find the same people at the wharf and union square. So if you have a budget or even if you dont I recommend the Monarch. You can walk to Union Square in 10 minutes, spend 7 bucks on a cab to the wharf, or walk around the corner to Van Ness and shop for a new Land Rover or Mercedes.
This is a well managed, clean hotel with nice enough rooms and a great cleaning staff. Just don't expect to do a lot of walking from your hotel after dark or to be able to leave your windows open at night. We heard people yellow/fighting in the street all night and a lot of dog fighting. I walked to and from the hotel during the day with no problem but at night this is a pretty sketchy location.Bottom line- if you are looking for somewhere clean and affordable, this place is fine, just don't plan to spend time in the few blocks around the hotel.
The hotel is very well located close to Van Ness avenue and close to the main points and attractions in SF.
This hotel is definitely not top notch. If you can book it cheap then it will provide you with a bed and a bathroom and cable TV. One thing that really pissed me off was that the wifi is extremely slow that it's almost impossible to use.So if you can book it cheap, good for you, if not, look for somewhere else.Thank you very much for your feedback, which is much appreciated. We are sorry that you didn't love our hotel, but we trust that you found your room to be clean and comfortable, and suitable for your needs. We are very sorry that you experienced issues with our WiFi, this is something that we are addressing with our provider, in an attempt to provide a better service for our guests. We would love to host you again when you are in the area thank you for your review. Best wishes, Hotel Management
This hotel is simple but clean and with charm. I like the room in the 4th floor. It is big and clean. The bathroom is quite enough and clean after a long stroll around the city. I feel that the bed is new and I saw too that they are delivering new bed mattress to the other rooms. The price I paid for the hotel is just enough for the expectations. Kinda just exact. I didn't have any negative vibes. The ladies staffs are great and helpful. I will come back on this hotel.
the room was horrible with dirty showers. I would agree: that's the worst hotel I have ever been respectively that I left before I slept there as I just couldn't imagine, sleeping there during my holidays! I certainly will not recoomend this place to my friends!Dear Dimitri, we are sorry that you did not have a great stay with us. We aim to provide clean, comfortable and pleasant stay for all our guests so we are disappointed to hear that this was not the case. Our room service team generally does a great job when it comes to preparing the room for upcoming guests, so it is strange that this had happened. Please know we will look into your experience further to ensure this does not happen again. We hope you will give us another try.
How lovely to finally find our hotel and discover the sign reads the NARCH HOTEL!, thankfully it didnt live up to its accidently given name! The reception staff were polite, if a little unapproachable, we had to discover all the facilities of the hotel by roaming around....only after 5 daysof braving the homeless people to use the phone in the street, did we discover the payphone and vending machines. They could really use a map of the hotel, or at least show you the facillities on arrival. Our room was comfy and clean, the bed was a brilliant size and so nice to crawl into after scaling the hills all day!! The maid service was excellent. The down sides were apparent straight away, our room was facing the corner of a busy junction, on the 6th floor....the constant traffic woke us up frequently as did the fire trucks which used their sirens freely and at least twice in the night, every night!!!!! The area is dodgy looking but actually not as bad as we anticipated, true there are homeless people everywhere and the street cleaners dont seem to venture that far, but we never had any trouble ( in fact i encountered more scary situations in the lift with non english speaking leery men who find it 'funny' to wedge you into a corner...) most homeless people were friendly or kept to themselves. Take a right as you come out the hotel, and you'll find a fantastic sandwhich shop QUIZNOS, right again and a cinema,diner and cocktail bar which are all really nice yet not mentioned in our guide. Lovely trip overall!!!
You get what you pay for this is a great deal if you don't mind the area. Staff was very friendly helpful and rooms, bedding bathroom was clean. Here are some tips/info you should know: It is right across the street from a facility where the homeless get services they are always hanging out there. The closest BART station, Civic Center, pops up in the middle of what could be called a homeless tent city. As a woman with 3 children traveling with me, all wheeling airport bags, we were very out of place walking to the hotel the kids were terrified. I felt much safer walking to the hotel from the west side-Van Ness street where there is great access to public transport.I wouldn't rule out going back to the Monarch on another trip if I needed a budget hotel, but I wouldn't bring kids there I'm not sure I'd go alone.Erica H,Thank for such a well-thought out and kind review. We always appreciate when a guest has taken the time to be so thorough. I am glad that you enjoyed stay at our hotel. We aim to provide comfortable, pleasant stay at a very competitive price. Thanks again for your stay and we sincerely hope that you visit us soon again next time you visit San Francisco.
Nice hotel close to downtown and Civic Center and one block from Van Ness. Hotel reminds me of small european hotel with beautiful lobby and elevator. Staff was helpful. Secure building, all rooms are inside secure lobby. Rooms are clean and roomy with windows that open. Coffee and tea in lobby. It is downtown SF so there will be some street noise. Paid parking next to hotel. Good place for the price. Felt secure staying alone.
We arrived in San Francisco on the Friday, did some sight seeing, bought souvenirs, We eventually got to the hotel around 9pm, we parked on the street just minutes away from the hotel, there were a few homeless people in the streets and didn't think too much of it, Next morning we went to our rental vehicle only to see it was broken into and a few of our belongings were stolen, The front desk was helpful in calling the police for us to get things sorted out. The next night we chose to pay for the valet service at 35.00 a night. because once we did more driving around we realized it was a very bad neighbourhood, not child friendly or even adult friendly for that matter . The hotel offered coffee and juice and the morning and this was not very good. Overall was not enjoyable to stay
First the bad - you get what you pay for, the building old and the lifts are rickety - one of those lifts where your not sure if you will make it up to your floor or not! The safe isn't electronic so you need to go to the reception pay 5 and get a key. Slightly worryingly the receptionist told me they only have a certain number of keys for the safes. As mentioned the streets close by are full of homeless, drunks and junkies. That said, there isn't too much the hotel can do about that.The rooms are not too bad, enough space and have a walk-in wardrobe to hang your clobber. Despite my earlier comments the hotel is central enough to get around the main attractions in a short taxi journey. A good place to stay if you aren't planning on spending much time in the hotel.Thank you for taking the time to provide a review of your stay. We are glad that you enjoyed our central location, and found our hotel so convenient for exploring the city. We are sorry that there were some elements of your stay which you did not enjoy. Please rest assured that although our lift is old, it is quite safe. We are sorry that you felt some areas of the hotel need updating but we do appreciate your feedback on this and will take your comments into consideration. Best wishes, Hotel Management
The hotel decor is a bit dated and the rooms slightly neglected. The bathroom wasn't great we did complain about our shower and the did quickly send a housekeeper to take a look at it. The rooms were a moderate size. There is a bit of noise from the streets below however it is a city destination. What I wish we knew beforehand is that it is opposite a night shelter for the homeless therefore there were. Few people on the street corner talking/signing and praying to themselves. Was slightly intimidating walking pass in the evenings. The valet took 20 /30 mins to collect the car when requested during the stay- though the staff were helpful. Rooms don't have a coffee machine either. The lighting in the rooms was dim - little impractical and the plug sockets a bit suspect. Dear SGee2013, We're sorry to hear you had this impression. We do our best to make sure that you're completely happy whenever you stay with us -- our Front Desk team is always there to help make this happen. Hopefully we'll get a second chance to show you our best. All the best, Monarch Hotel Management
Hotel Monarch is old hotel, but furniture was the room is not bad and there was enough for us. There were even hairdrier, iron, iron table in the room. Room was clean enough. At the begining, when we were going to our room, we felt the smell in the corridor (old carpet, corpses) In the room though it was ok. Location is not bad. It's not the center, but we got to most places on foot, that took from 15 to 40 minutes (Chinatown, Academy of Science, Piers). Hotel proposes guests free tee-coffee and WI-FI. Tee and coffee was ok, but WI-FI didn't work in reallity. Our laptop found good connection, but if we opened web-pages, they can't be downloaded. Once we witnessed, how six different people came to reception with the same problem. The staf tried to help, but in vain. But if Internet connection is not important in your trip, it's not bad place to stay.
Hotel staff was awesome during my entire 4 day stay! The hotel however, needs serious updating and plumbing maintenance. Decor is okay, rooms are small, floors/walls are quite thin. I could here the activities and conversations of those in nearby rooms. Insufficient ventilation in bathroom causing serious fog for hours. Area is heavily populated with homeless people with a community centers across the street from hotel. Wifi was horrible. No microwave. Refrig in select rooms. Elevator issues due to being so outdated. No breakfast, but coffee available 24/7 in lobby along with knats. Again front desk guys and housekeeping were very nice. Easy walk to union square, clubs, bars and food. Management really needs to invest in updates to the property's plumbing, wifi, guest accommodations to include refrig/microwaves and the environment immediately around the hotel as much as possible. Some guest room views are an open space shared with the apt complex next door and displays trash and a view into tenants' apts. I paid too much for my experience.We are obviously very pleased with your report of the great service that you received at our hotel. We do occupy an older building most of the buildings in this area are quite old, but we work tirelessly to ensure quality standards are upheld for our guests. We are very sorry to hear that this was not particularly evident to you. We are sorry that our property was not more suitable for your needs. Best wishes, Hotel Management.
Got a nice road facing room, with nice bed. Lot of choices of restaurants available. Quick check in and friendly staff. Nice recommendation for food. Free wi-fiBut poor walls. You can even hear others radio or water running in adjacent room. That's a problem!Hi Ratnangi M, Thank you for choosing the Monarch Hotel for your recent stay. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed many of our amenities and the room, We do have a good location with access to many restaurants close by. We are glad that you enjoyed your stay overall. We are constantly making improvements throughout the hotel, as far as noise is concerned, we we do ask guests to keep the noise level low after certain time and if needed help our guests shift to another room to accommodate their needs. Thanks again for your stay and feedback, hope to be your host again next time you are in San Francisco.
I rarely write reviews but after reading some of the scathing reviews, and wanting to cancel my own reservation after reading them (but had booked a nonrefundable reservation), I wanted to make sure this sweet little hotel receives the credit it deserves. I just stayed one night, prior to a residency interview in SF, so to be fair, was only in the hotel to sleep.First of all, the front desk is incredibly accommodating and efficient. Check in was a breeze. I requested the quietest room, and the nice man at the front desk gave me a room on the top floor away from the supposedly noisy elevator. The lobby is perfectly nice, did not smell, and I was very comfortable sitting there waiting for my ubers. The room was clean, quiet and the bed was comfortable (and I am actually quite picky about springy mattresses). There are some homeless people across the street, but I was never bothered or approached by any of them. Honestly, if it upsets you to see homeless people, SF is probably not the city you want to visit. The only negative was that the hallway did have a mild odor, but my room was fine. Overall, you stay at this hotel to spend less than 100 on a room in a very expensive city. It is not a luxurious experience, but it is a perfectly comfortable place to spend a night and I would recommend it.Thank you so much Lauren for making an exception for us, and taking the time to write such a comprehensive review of your stay with us. We're delighted that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you found us to be a reasonable, yet clean and comfortable hotel for your short stay. We sincerely hope that your residency interview went well - you might need to recommend somewhere for family and friends to come and visit you! Thank you again for your review, Best Regards, Hotel Management
We wanted to be close to public transportation, the wharf, and attractions. The room was nicely done and we could watch the sunset from our window.

This hotel has had bad publicity in the passed... However the new owners are making it work.. They are in the middle of renovating the property. I found it to be extremely clean...I would recommend staying here..... And I will be staying there next time I attend the Salinas Rodeo..
Stayed here for a couple of nights it was ok. Its right next to a Shell gas station and the freeway which was a huge plus. Denny's is on the property so breakfast was easy. They do allow pets the guy next door had a dog barking all night so my wife didn't get much sleep. The check-in office smelled like cigarette smoke both days. I had to use the washer and dryers which charge about 6 dollars (all quarters) a load which is crazy and they supplied me with change which was cool. The bed sheets were very thin. They had nice sinks, tv was ok but cable channels were average. Parking was tight. Overall it was ok some good things some bad.
We have stayed on and off at this property for the last 10 years when coming to LA-Always Clean and great service. The recent upgrades to the rooms are very nice and create a modern space.

We stayed for seven days, as the basis for a holiday in San Francisco, with several trips around the Bay Area. For our purposes, it was the perfect hotel.It was booked via our travel agent, and when I afterwards saw previous Tripadvisor reviews, I was quite concerned. However, I'm really glad we weren't put off by them.It's clearly quite an old hotel, and we were staying in one of the motel-style rooms in the main part of the hotel. As Brits on holiday for the first time in America, it felt like lovely quaint Americana. The fittings and furniture were clearly new a good few decades ago, but everything was functional and clean. The staff were helpful and polite. The location is great for public transport - just a few minutes' walk to Market Street, and then you're right next to MUNI stops, and the Civic Center BART station, so travel around the city and beyond is very convenient.It's a very limited breakfast (but that's advertised), and a great bonus is that it's right next door to Sightglass - a lovely coffee roastery and coffee bar, if you want a good coffee to start the day. You're also right around the corner from two excellent craft beer bars - City Beer Store, and Cellarmaker.Being in the South of Market area (SOMA), you do feel you need your wits about you if out after dark, but it's the same in any city really.Overall, if you want a stylish hotel with modern fittings, this isn't it. But we wanted a budget hotel in the centre of the city for a holiday, and it was perfect for us.
I agree with all of the other reviews that say this hotel is shabby and run down. Staff are slow and totally not helpful. We had a suite across the street, well OMG, It was like something out of a horror show. We came from Canada and didn't know the city at all. We had picked up a hotel guide along the way and the Knights Inn was the featured hotel so we thought it had to be okay. Who ever put out that guide should be sued. Thank God we were able to find another hotel the next day. The room had bed bugs and when I told the person at the desk she accused me of bringing them with me.I tried to get a hold of Varsha Patel but she never called us back. I see she is quick to respond to bad reviews though. You are better off sleeping on the street instead of staying at this dump!!! Varsha wake up and smell the coffee! Go across the street and sleep in one of your rooms then you will know what everyone is talking about.
We only spent a day and a half in this beautiful city. But I will for sure be returning for further exploration. We stayed at the Limited Edition Ramada Inn on Lombard, down on the wharf. Clean and fairly quite accomodations. The man at the front was extremely nice though.Explored the wharf at night and in the day and thought it was fantastic. Did a trip to Alcatraz. If you haven't been I suggest a trip there. Beautiful and full of so much history. Nice day trip. As I said already didn't get much else in but that. For sure requires more time than we had to commit to..
I booked a room at the Ramada Limited Downtown San Francisco for 4 nights (19-23 May 2007) six months in advance at a room rate of 113 per night plus tax. The advertisement stated that there was free continental breakfast, free wireless internet in the rooms, refurbished large rooms, free coffee makers, etc. Despite having booked well in advance I did not get a room in the hotel but rather in the annex and at the same room rate. The annex was across the street and partway down the block and this was not at all like what was advertised.1 There were no elevators. I had to carry my bags up several fights of stairs to get to the room.2 The room was tiny (9 x 13 feet) and had only a single twin bed. My confirmation was for a queen-sized bed.3 The room was dark because the light bulbs had been removed from the lamps and the overhead light was dim. The carpet was filthy, so perhaps this was deliberate.4 There was no internet access. There might have been access if you walked back across the street and down the block to the main building and then stood in the lobby but I did not try this,5 The continental breakfast was only available to guests in the main building according to Samir, the desk clerk.6 There was no coffee or coffee maker.7 There was no bathtub - only a small shower stall. In any case, it would be ill advised to take a shower because only two thin hand towels were provided for guests making it impossible to dry off.8 The air conditioner was broken. It was running but not cooling and all of the knobs had been removed so it was impossible to adjust any settings. Perhaps for this reason, the room had a foul odor.I returned to the main building, it was now about 3.30 PM, and I asked Samir for a different room - similar to what was advertised when I booked the room. He told me this was impossible. I then told him that I would not be using the room and I would find other accommodations and he told me that my credit card would still be billed the full amount because I had already checked in. I returned to my room down the street and I called Ramada customer service telephone support and a nice fellow named Jason (I believe) agreed that this was a problem but he said that all Ramada properties are independently owned and thus he could do nothing for me. He gave me the name of the manager of this property and suggested that I keep trying to contact him directly.I packed an overnight bag and left my luggage in the room as I did not want to haul it down the stairs and around the city looking for another room and I was going to be charged for the room anyway. I stayed in the Marriott that night and retuned the next day to check out of the Ramada. At the desk was the acting manager, Bobbie, who explained that the manager, Mr. Monday, was in Indonesia. Bobbie had not been told anything about my problem but he quickly found me an acceptable room in the main building and helped me move my bags so I completed my stay at the Ramada. In compensation for my problems and having to take a room at the Marriott the first night he took 12.90 (!) off my total bill of 515.76 (not very impressive).I am extremely dissatisfied by this affair. The property is not as advertised and the price is far in excess for similar rooms in the city. Indeed, the room I was given in the annex was dangerous and uninhabitable. The Ramada staff at the hotel were unwilling to help until I was about to leave early, the telephone support from Ramada was unable to help resolve this problem.
I LOVE San Francisco but this place was not a highlight. We waited for almost an hour just to check in (checkout was not much better) and in that time 3-4 different people made complaints ranging from no hot water to toilets being blocked (2 Toilets), the receptionist handed them a plunger to deal with it themselves!! When we finally got checked in we had to go accross the road and up steep narrow stairs (which I fell on twice) to get to our room which was not much bigger than the queen size bed in there. Their free wi-fi only works in the reception area and the breakfast a danish or muesli bar (only allowed 1) was very lacking!The neighbourhood left A LOT to be desired, I did not feel safe. It is in a bad part of town and is not local to the shopping area.This is one place I will not be going anywhere near EVER again.Dear Guest,You did book the smallest and least expensive room, however, it is very clean and well-appointed and does have a TV/remote, coffee/tea maker with condiment package, iron/board, hairdryer and a closet area however, you are correct, those few rooms do not have good internet connection, thus the lower rates. San Francisco is a very compact city and land is limited and we really can not do anything about that fact. We do have a very clean hotel and we do our level best, and it is clearly indicated that we have two buildings opposite each other, we market our hotel honestly and have done our level best on accuracy. We are also in a quiet street where the main Police department and all the superior courts are located just in a 2 block radius, and 4 blocks to the main cable car station, visitor center, SF Nordstrom/ Bloomingdale shopping center, our area is known for fine restaurants, lounges and cafes - SoMa District. Wishing you all the best.
DISGUSTING DUMP! If this hotel is an example of the Ramada chain the health department should shut them down. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I shall never visit another Ramada hotel again. The room stinks. I am guessing the carpets have never been cleaned. The room was not cleaned. The bathroom is filthy. The tv gets 4 channels and stopped working the second day. The elevator does not work so all luggage had to be taken up to the top floor by hand. The phone does not work, the sheets are full of holes and the curtains smell. DO NOT STAY AT RAMADA HOTELS. I believe deseases cold be hatching in the rooms. Where is the San Francisco health department to protect the public Health department and tourist bureau start doing your job, SHUT THE DUMP DOWN NOW!.
This is the most perfect and convenient place to stay in SF, SoMa, during various Folsom Street events such as Folsom Street Fair and Up Your Alley. I am very pleased with the rates, the location and the quality of the rooms and will gladly return there in the future.
My wife and I were just staying at the hotel for one night and believe me when I say I didn't expect much to begin with because you get what you pay for, which is fine.I just needed an economical stay for one night - that's all.Well this one night stay turned out to be a nightmare!1) We arrived very late because our flight got delayed into San Fran. When we finally got to the hotel it was after midnight and there was one attendant working the front desk.As he was checking us in, the hotel system went down. The man spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out what to do and could not check us in at all. When he finally had everything back up, it all went down again which led to a much longer wait just to get our room. We finally got our room key well past 1am, which was after more than an hour of waiting.2) This next issue makes the first one seem like nothing.Our room was on the 3rd floor and the next morning I wanted to go move my car closer to our room. I called up the one and only elevator they have in the place and took it down to the main floor. Well just before I got to the first floor the elevator just stopped. I realized It was stuck. It is a very small and old elevator which made me feel so claustrophobic! I pressed all the buttons trying to go back up, open the door, the alarm button and what not. I even knocked on the door and screamed for help.I was in the elevator for about 10 minutes but it seemed like an hour and no one came to my assistance. Finally I kept holding the door open button and the door opened a crack and I pushed it open the rest of the way. It was on the ground floor thankfully so I was able to walk out. I had a did that just happen moment and was in total shock.What was even more shocking was that there was a sign on the first floor noting the the elevator was out of service! That's great but where was the frickin sign on the second and third floors Who was the genius that decided one sign would be enoughI got to the front desk and spoke with the man on duty and explained the situation. All he said was that he's new and he will put signs on the other floors (better late than never) and that the manager wasn't in that day so they would reach out to me.I took the manager's email address just in case. We checked in and got the hell out of there.Well it's been a week now and I haven't heard anything from management at all. In fact I emailed them a few days ago explaining why I had such a horrible situation to give them a chance to address it and I've gotten nothing back.I realize the elevator situation and the system going down might just be bad luck but it's how the staff responded that makes me upset. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever.If you decide to stay here don't expect service you'd get from an average hotel. It's far worse.
This was my first visit to a Guest Ranch and thus first visit to The Hideout. Simply fantastic. They treat their animals and their guests very well, and to a person, have a customer-oriented approach to the experience.

Thought the outside/area was a little questionable but we were pleasantly surprised inside. Our room was super clean and was updated. Modern furniture, too. Staff was nice. There was free coffee in the lobby in the morning but I didn't try it. Wifi didn't work well when we were there.
Very good hotel, we have stayed here for years and will continue to do so.When staying in Ranch Cucamonga California we never consider any other hotel the Best Western Heritage is the only place to stay. Very close to the malls, restaurants, easy access to freeways it is a very well located Hotel.
Room had a beautiful view and its in a beautiful clean area. Lobby reception area is under renovation but they were still able to service us efficiently. Only one thing was that our non-smoking room did smell like a smoker was there.
Nice roadside motel. Beds and rooms very comfortable. Not much to do in town but near Painted Desert and Petrified Forest. Some good restaurants in the area too. Room was comfortable, not big, but a good value for what we paid.Dear Guest, Thank you for taking time to take our survey. We greatly appreciate your stay with us. Tina Gill General Manager

Overall, I enjoyed my two night stay at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in Downtown Chicago, but have a few concerns. I was in town with a bus load of University of Louisville fans to support our basketball team during the game with DePaul University. There were not enough suites available with two double beds at the hotel to accommodate our group. So, I had to share a king-sized bed with my roommate. We were really disappointed that we couldn't have our own bed. So, we each rotated sleepng in the bed one night and then sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room. However, the sofa bed was absoultely horrible!!! The mattress was very thin and the inner springs poked through the surface of the mattress. This made sleeping very uncomfortable. Also, the top portion of the mattress where your head goes was higher than the rest of the mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a slant. The mattress was so uncomfortable until I closed the sofa bed and replaced the cushions. Then I tried putting the cover on top and sleepng on top of the sofa, However, I am 5'11 tall and the sofa was more like a loveseat size. So, I could not stretch out completely. I got very little sleep and awoke stiff and sore. My back and neck hurt. It was also awkward having to go through the bedroom to use the toilet and shower in the bathroom or to get clothes from the closet without disturbing my roommate while she slept in the bed. The layout of the suite was not well-thoughout as far as utilization of the bathroom and closet.On the plus side of the suite, the kitchen was wonderful! We liked having a fully equipped kitchen with appliances and dishes. We also enjoyed the breakfast! Shirley Fuqua-Jackson, Room 1203Shirley, I am sorry that you did not enjoy your stay at the hotel. I wanted to address your concern about not receiving a room with two double beds. When looking back at the original rooming list that we have from your group leader we do not have you and your roommate in a room with two double beds. The room type that your group leader had assigned to your room was a King Suite with the sleeper sofa. The hotel des have a very limited number of double/double rooms on property so we were unable to change room types if we do not have the availability. I do want to express regret over this misunderstanding. I do apologize for the uncomfortable evening that you spent on our sleeper sofa. We are in the process of replacing all of our bed inserts and we do hope that nobody will be as inconvenienced as you in the future. We do have a limited number of complimentary roll-away beds available if you find the sleeper sofa too uncomfortable in the future. We are pleased that you enjoyed the breakfast and the full stocked kitchen. We do hope to see you again. Sincerely, Vanessa KosloskiSales and Marketing Manager
Decided to go with this hotel after seeing it was the best rated for families on TripAdvisor. I would agree wholeheartedly. Location is excellent. Included breakfast is excellent. The rooms are excellent - having the suite allows you to close the door and let the kids go to bed without having to sit in the dark. Full fridge, microwave dishwasher, sink, table so you can easily keep milk/food for the week or just get takeout and eat in the room when you can't face another night of waiting for a table with hungry kids.The valet/concierge staff was the best I've ever experienced. They were all extremely nice and helpful, it was the same crew every day so we felt comfortable with them and most importantly, they very friendly to kids. Especially a man named Adbul - he remembered our kids (4 and 6) every time we came in or out and joked around with them, which made them feel very special.Room was clean and well maintained. To be honest and objective, the first day we were there there was a hair on one of the towels which freaked my wife out, but I didn't think it was a huge deal and it didn't happen again. We had to call for extra towels every night instead of them just leaving them for us when they cleaned the room, but they always brought them up right away. But these are minor points - overall excellent.The pool is on the 19th floor with big windows with city view. The kids were excited but with the sunshine it felt like a sauna so we didn't spend time there. But it was as nice as any hotel pool I've seen.Read the comments about the fact that they only have 2 elevators which caused some people delays, but I have to say we didn't experience that at all - the elevators always came right away even during peak times.Shuttle to Navy Pier drops you off right in front of the hotel. We walked into Phil Stefani's Italian restaurant around the corner and while it was a higher end restaurant, they welcomed us with our kids in our shorts and we had a great meal.The hotel is right across from a hotel with great shopping. Highly recommend the Lego Store. We went to the Legoland play center in Schaumburg the next day (highly recommend) and you can buy tickets at the store in the mall for a great discount. Saved us 28. Easy walk to Michigan Ave. My wife and daughter did the whole American Girl thing and had a great time.Overall a really excellent hotel that we will definitely stay at again.

Very old motel. The parking lot needed to be repaved. Rooms were small but they were comfortable. They could have used some updating. There was wifi. A Dollar General was next door. There are a couple of fast food places North on US 75.

We had to stay here during the Hurricane Irma and this place was the only place I could get a room for my family. The one good thing I can say is the staff is really nice.

Just stayed here Feb '12. Not a horrible place for the . I paid 85 for the room and it's right in downtown atlanta next to the marriot. Usually the location at lone would command 100 minimum per night. Parking was confusing. i don't like to pay for valet so I opted to park my car alone when I pulled up, and about 100ft down the street from the main entrance is a parking garage in the same bldg, so I parked there (15 a day). Upon walking to the desk to check in I was informed their parking garage is cheaper, but it's located caddy corner across the st to the hotel (weird). The desk clerk tried to convince me to go get my car from where it was parked and pull it into their garage - again, weird. I was put on the 9th floor (elevator is pretty shoddy - as soon as it stops at a floor the doors immediately open and shut to keep going, be careful). The room wasn't too bad. Decent size. Old tv, pretty visually unappealing. Bathroom was full of hairs, everywhere. Also there was a bucket under the sink to deal with a leaking pipe. I'm usually low maintenance and don't mind the occasional spot or hair, but this room just felt really dirty and gross. The bed was the worst part. Although it was a king, it was horribly uncomfortable. Worst back pain of my life in the morning. Fitness center is a joke. Although spacious, it has a treadmill and a bike, and a multi gym weight tower in the middle, that is in awful condition and all of the cables are broken. I didn't even bother working out there. Breakfast was modest. Literally ice cold pastries, watered down juices, do it yourself waffles, and reconstituted eggs. Breakfast starts at 6 and I got there at 6:30, and a kid that apparently worked there (no id/uniform) was scrambling to set everything up - I'm guessing he was late for work. Other people he was hanging out with and eating with (other employees or his friends) were also there chatting and having a good time. Very strange, I don't think they were guests, and I think it is inappropriate for the employees to be eating breakfast with guests.Again, for the price I'm really not complaining, you get what you pay for. Location isn't too bad either. Had I paid more of this was a more prestigious brand hotel, I'd be writing a letter to the CEO.shaunbsc,Thank you for your review. Since your stay, we have been actively working to improve our service level, responsiveness, and the functionality of our products to ensure things are operating as they should.

Room was filthy. Staff was mediocre. Stained sheets, used medicine cups in drawer, filters full of dust and leaky shower. Place is a dump and not worth the price. Would not recommend to anyone, especially if you are traveling with kids. Dear Bobby,Thank you for your feedback. We take our guest comments very seriously and always strive to provide comfortable and friendly accommodations. Were sorry we fell below your expectation regarding cleanliness, carpet condition, bathroom amenities and bathroom cleanliness which was unacceptable. We will address these concerns. I assure you that the feedback of our hotel will be reviewed and most certainly forwarded to the appropriate departments. We take the confidence our guests place in us very seriously and work diligently to rectify any unsatisfactory experiences. We hope you give us a chance in the future to show you how great our hotel is.Sincerely,

This property is extremely close to all the Disney Parks and main Marriott hotel (on property). Location, Location, Location. The overall property is very good and the staff is outstanding. Unfortunately our initial experience was very rough but the property management took accountability, immediately fixed the issues and followed up repeatedly to ensure our satisfaction. My family checked into the three bedroom villa on December 26th for seven days at Disney World. The overall layout of the room is excelled and we enjoyed the screened in porch overlooking the golf course and pond (ducks included). Upon arriving, the villa floors were filthy, carpets stained and bar stools worn to threadbare state. We've stayed at many Marriott Vacation Club properties over the years and experienced beautiful, clean and new(er) villas. The cleanliness of our villa was out of the ordinary. I called the GM, Eugene, and he immediately brought his staff to our villa to assess the situation and offer apologies. He committed to having all fixed by the time we returned from Magic Kingdom later that day. Eugene and team came through with grace and excellence. The room was deep cleaned, carpets shampooed and furniture replaced with brand new pieces. The Vacation Club staff treated me and my family like Diamond status owners the rest of the week. Eugene and his team turned a situation into an experience we will never forget. Well done!Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced upon arrival but it is great to hear Eugene and staff were able to resolve the issue swiftly and to your satisfaction. We hope you will join us again sometime soon.
Our golf group decided to visit Orlando again this year. We stayed here from November 1-10. As a Marriott Associate from Niagara Falls, we were able to receive a discount. I still would have paid the rack rate at this property. Our three bedroom unit was perfect for us. We had all the amenities of home. We cooked in our unit about half the time and even used the BBQ twice. Supplies for beer and groceries were nearby. We found the Marriott staff to be helpful and very courteous. Hawks' Landing Golf course was a short drive by shuttle and very convenient. Other courses such Grande Pines were close as well. The facilities were first class. The unit obviously had been renovated with new counter tops, kitchen cupboards, marble in the bathrooms, and new appliances. The balcony overlooked a large pond with plenty of wildlife there. Each room had its own flat sreen TV. The only down side is the analog reception and no GOLF CHANNEL. The small pool area and hot tub next to unit was great. There is also a large pool area as well. Our group agreed that we would love to come back to Marriott's Imperial Palms.
We rented a three bedroom villa here for a week. Everyone had their own room. Property was quiet. No kids running around. Nice staff clean rooms. Best of all was jaccuzi tub
We were a group of 8 ladies aging from 23 - 64. We checked in on a Friday, the room wasn't quite ready so took the shuttle over to the Marriott World Center for a poolside lunch. My only negative of our stay was that the front desk was suppose to call/text when our room was ready and they didn't. We ate, roamed around World Center for a bit and shuttled back. Once back, we napped in the lobby for nearly an hour before I checked in with the front desk and yes, our room was indeed ready. We had a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a living room, dining room and kitchen which was plenty big for our party. Everyone we encountered was more than pleasant and went out of their way to greet us. We used the main pool on a Sunday which was not crowded at all. The store in the main building was complete in their offerings of drinks, snacks, fruit and pre-packaged meals as well as suntan lotions and basic toiletries. The location is perfect for a Disney vacation and a short Uber ride to the Universal Parks. This was our second stay in the Marriott complex and we look forward to our next visit.Welcome back! We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in Orlando. Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We look forward to your next visit.
A great location for a large group. Villa sleeps 10. On site activities provided yet our mission was Disney. Only 10 minutes. Nowadays when you stay on the property you are just as far. Easy walk to Marriott world and the largest pool in Florida. Although site provides pool and hit tub. Shuttles provided to work world center.We found pizza and Chinese's who deliver or many places nearby. Even use the concierge to get you all set. Only setback was an anticipated Full pullout in one room only to have a twin. As we had 5 little ones it didn't put us out but ask if thinking on all days.
Orlando properties tend to be hit-or-miss. This one is definitely a hit. Absolutely no complaints about the property or staff. All good. Location can't be beat. Multiple pools, tennis, half-court basketball. The unit itself was updated, Beds comfortable. The unit we had came with a screened-in room great for enjoying the evening without bugs.
The exterior could use some updating. However, the interior is very spacious for our large family. The resort is very close to Disney parks Downtown Disney. You have access to JW Marriott amenities at no extra cost. There is a complimentary shuttle that will take you there and back. Our kids loved the pool and slides at the JW. There are activities planned if you want to spend time on the property. The only things I was not happy with is there are no utensils in the grill areas, pools close rather early and the motor went bad in our refrigerator around 9:30pm one evening. It was not fixed until the next morning, so the noise overnight and early wake up by the repairman was less than pleasant.
We were in a three bedroom villa. Wow....what a great place to stay... Close to everything...especially the venues at WDW.The unit was spacious, and loaded with everything we needed. The pools were great and a nice area to relax in after a tough day with a 3 yr old at the Magic Kingdom. Easy to get to all the places on International Drive. Easy to get to the airport...plenty of free parking...we really enjoyed our stay at the Imperial Palms Villas

Looking for an awful experience at a nasty hotel, this south Orlando Hampton in is for you. Not only will you be hasseled by complete incompetence, the manager (ha, what a joke Natoya Edwards is) will blindly defend her dump then lie to your face and her suoeriors. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else
Thank you for always makings us feel welcome and at home. The staff was great and room was in great shape. I needed to use the Bussiness Center and it was clean and and easy to access it. Thank you for everything
We stayed here for one night after driving up from the Tampa airport to Orlando area to meet family that has already arrived. I found an amazing rate (under 100 total bill!) and it made the decision to stay here easy. The hotel is at Exit 55, right off of I-4 at US-27, about 7-12 miles from the I-4 Disney... More

Had no experience with riff-raff hanging around or rude desk workers. Very dog friendly. Easy in, easy out, plenty of ice. Easy parking, some freeway noise but windows do not open so AC drowned it out. If you are on vacation, it's not luxury, but if you are looking for a safe, clean place to sleep, it's fine.
We had 4 adults and 1 child (age 7). This was our grandchild's first trip away from home. Room 120 is marketed as a suite. It's not. It's a regular hotel room with 2 queen size beds and then a closet with a full size bed inside of it. I kid you not!The grandparents (us) wanted a seperate bedroom so we were stuck in the closet. There was not enough room for 2 adults to walk around in the room. You open the door and there's the bed. There was 6 from the edge of the opened door to the edge of the bed. The bed was up against the wall. There was one tv in the entire suite. That tv was outside of the closet bedroom. There was one side table lamp in the suite and that was not in the closet bedroom. The closet bedroom had a floor lamp on the opposite side of the closet from the bed and a blaring overhead light. There was just enough room in the closet bedroom to open one piece of luggage. There was a very small side table in the closet bedroom where one could put their clothes in...a bit tough if there's 2 adults in the closet bedroom staying 4 nights. What little carpet you were exposed to in the closet bedroom was sticky as though someone had spilled a soft drink by the side table.Had we known this we never would've booked here. Thus the reason for me writing to help other guests.The staff was extremely nice. We had rented a scooter and that was left in the hotel lobby overnight as none of the hotel rooms on the property would be able to accomodate a scooter. We were provided with plenty of clean towels in the one small bathroom in our suite.The pool was very clean.The breakfast consisted of frozen donuts (no microwave is available in the lobby eating area...if you wanted them heated up you had to take it to your room and use your microwave there), powdered scrambled eggs, bagels, small yogurts, a few pieces of fruit, milk, juice and coffee. Cereals were available from the bulk cereal dispenser and there was a waffle maker. The breakfast area was tiny. Since we stayed here from Oct 23 - Oct 27 there weren't a bunch of families to battle with in this breakfast area. I can not even fathom eating in the breakfast area during summer vacation, spring break, or during the holiday season when multiple families are in abundance. The seating consisted of 4 tables...2 tables accomodated 4 people and 2 tables accomodated 2 people (12 people total in the seating area). Of note, since this was something we had never experienced in any other hotels we've stayed in over a 40+ year span, there were two police vehicles parked outside the lobby with officers in the lobby that started one of our mornings off before heading to the Happiest Place on Earth. We didn't want to know what may have happened for their being there but the officers weren't there to partake in the breakfast, if you catch my drift.Parking was adequate and free. The maids like to trash talk about the guests in Spanish. This might be ok for persons who aren't Spanish-fluent, but we are. There's a sand pit playground area in the courtyard. It seemed to be in good repair. Our grandson didn't play in the area. I can't speak for any noise level this may cause in the rooms that surround the courtyard.Don't say you weren't warned. You get what you pay for. And no, we would never stay here again.
This hotel was a very good rate. We stayed here mid-september on a stop over trip to San Fran. The hotelroom had plenty of space for our family of 3 BUT it did smell really really musty. The shower curtain was a bit worn. The water pressure was great! The breakfast provided was very good but the seating area was so incredibly small. The woman at the front desk was a wonderful help with out Disneyland visit. She gave us some tips and helped us order our tickets.Thank you for taking the time to share your review. I apologize for any musty smell that you experienced during your stay. We will schedule extra daily carpet cleaning. I hope you do not let this prevent you from staying with us in the future.
Very affordable given the Area. Close to Disneyland and also the Anaheim Packing District. We stayed here on the 2nd floor. Place was nice and clean, but we found it a little more difficult having to get to the floor by means of elevator as the stairs were a bit farther off. Service was ok and room had all the essentials, but there was one small snafu. Gf noticed a big spider on the ceiling which frightened her and when I mentioned to the front desk morning person, he just shrugged it off. Otherwise, a decent stay.
This is the perfect hotel for Disney! The room was clean. Everything worked. Staff was very friendly and looked for ways to help. The manager is there and eager to assist. Parking was easy. You can walk to Downtown Disney in less than 15 minutes... and it is an easy walk. Another 5-7 minutes and you're at the gate of the Disney Park. Breakfast was decent. I can't imagine a better value for a Disneyland trip.
We stayed here for three nights while visiting Disneyland. We had two rooms, one standard (for the in-laws) and one suite. We booked the suite in order to have a separate sleeping room for the kids. The extra room, however, was very small (just enough room to unfold the bed) and couldn't be used for much more than sleeping (it had no TV). Strangely, the extra room also lacked any heat (it only had a cooling unit). We were in Anaheim during a cold spell in January so this was problematic but didn't ruin our stay.The standard room seemed a bit more updated than the suite but, aside from some peeling paint, both rooms were clean and comfortable. The hot breakfast was perfect (selection included belgian waffles, eggs, sausages, toast, pastries, cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit) but, as has been noted by other reviews, the seating area is woefully inadequate. Fortuntately, we weren't there during a busy time so the lack of room was more of a nuisance than anything else.I estimated the walk to Disneyland front gates to be about a mile. For us, it took 15 to 20 minutes, which was what we expected.Service was friendly and attentive. All in, given the price, we thought the value was excellent and would stay here again.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay with us. I am checking into the issue you had with no heat in the suites extra room. I am also having the bathrooms repainted as we speak. I will speak to our staff again about reporting any issues about the rooms to me. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I assure you that they will be fixed by your next visit.
I stay here due to the proximity to Disneyland, it's a quick walk to the parks, and because I get the Best Western rewards. If you book enough in advance the prices are in line with the cheaper cost hotels. All BW hotels have decent beds, bathrooms, come with microwave and fridge with a good TV and channels. The housekeeping staff does a good job with the cleaning. They do not offer breakfast, but they do give Denny's breakfast vouchers and they offer a go bag in the morning with an apple, a granola bar, and a small water. I'm usually in too much of a hurry to get to Disneyland to where breakfast doesn't matter anyways. The Stovall's BW is a few hotels closer, but is usually a little more and they charge for parking, but they have a full breakfast. Both are good to stay in. The BW on Ball Rd is nice too, but the walk is further.

Family suite was huge and more than enough room for 6 adults and 2 toddlers. Room was very clean. Very close to Disneyland. You walk across the parking lot to the Paradise Pier hotel. Very Economical price compared to hotels at Disney.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and our Family Suite. Our suite is definitely large enough for families and we are thrilled it worked out for you and your family. Thank you again for your stay and we hope to see you again on future trips to the Anaheim area.
My daughter and I usually stay across the street from the Disneyland main gate. This was a last minute trip and Pavillions was the only place available. What a pleasant surprise. Very friendly and helpful staff. We were able to buy to park hoppers at a discount. The room was clean and comfortable. Wifi worked well. The grab and go breakfast snacks were nothing special. The walk to the parks was doable. We cut through the cast member parking lot across the street to Disneyland Hotel and onward to Downtown Disney. Sometimes we used the Monorail. It cut out a lot of the walk. The only downside for me is no in room safe. In the future I will still try to stay on Harbor Blvd. but wouldn't hesitate to stay here if that didn't work out.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are please you enjoyed our hotel and staff and look forward to seeing you on future trips to the Anaheim area. Thank you again.

If you are going to either Disneyland or coming for business this hotel is situated in an excellent way. Just a 15 min. walk from Disneyland and a 10 min. walk from the Anaheim convention center, thou it is a bit pricey but it is to be expected in an area like this. The rooms are very good and clean and check-in is very fast. Being a European i just don't like the fact that this hotel (like many other in the US) don't have breakfast but a breakfast to go good thing is that there is a dennys 20m away where you can have a decent breakfast, and they even have a small pool and jacuzzi if you want to relax after a days walk in Disneyland. Overall a very recommendable location.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are happy to hear you found our hotel and location helpful to your travels. As you stayed we are just a short walk to the Anaheim Convention Center as well as Disneyland. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area. Thank you again.
This hotel was the perfect location for us. We were directly across from Disneyland and could either walk or take the bus which had a stop directly in front of the hotel. The room was large and roomy with a refrigerator and microwave. We used the hot tub several nights and could see the fireworks. We also had easy access to the Interstate to sight see in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for your recent visit with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed our location and the amenities at the hotel. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area. Thank you again for your stay and review.
Stayed here in July booked with Travelocity. A large part of my disappoint I will blame on Travelocity, I'm pretty sure I was booking a Best Western that was 'right across' from Disneyland and with the inflated price, I was sure of it. When I arrived I of course expressed my concern to the Front Desk and they happily called the other Best Western to see if there was avail, but there was not. They very kind and down to earth front desk clerk checked us in early (9:30AM on a Monday) and we got a 1st floor room very close to the lobby, which I would actually recommend. The room: beds were pretty comfy, bed linens were soft, pillows were plentiful, towels could have been better but did the job. There was a fridge and coffee pot in the room along with a hair dryer. AC unit was a bit loud but when we came back to the room for naps, it didn't bother us one bit. I can't complain much about the room itself --nothing went wrong or was out of place. The location: Here is where I'll get picky. I would not recommend walking to the park with little ones from here. You have to cross a majorly busy intersection, then walk through the Cast Member parking lot (finally found a safe walking area inside). This will bring you to the end of Downtown Disney, from here you can either take the Monorail to Tomorrowland or walk what would be another 'block' to the Main Entrance. I would not do this at night time! Good thing is there is an ART shuttle right in front of the property. I swear by these ART shuttles, 5/day for a shuttle to the front of the parks and runs every 20 mins. Again a positive thing about our room location is that we were able to just open our room door and keep an eye out for the shuttle and then run to it. Long story short, I overpaid on Travelocity, even after considering the location mix up. But the staff is remarkable so it made up for it.
This is a clean and well-located motel. There is ample parking and the breakfast is your choice so 3 items plus a drink from Denny's. Very impressive. We walked across the street and cut through the employee parking to get to Universal Studios which cut 5 minutes off the walk. Great place to stay. They offer park tickets and a shuttle if you don't want to walk.
A friend and I stayed here for the first time over Labor Day weekend, and were impressed. We were running in the Disneyland Half Marathon early Sunday morning, and we requested a 2nd floor room away from the road so we could go to bed early without being disturbed, and that's exactly what we got at check in. The rooms were very nice and clean, and the beds were sooo comfortable. Additionally, they were very accommodating of our weird schedules. On the day we left, my friend had a late flight, and they not only permitted us to check out an hour late, but gave us new key cards with pool-only access so we could swim and sit by the pool until it was time to leave. We will definitely go back, as we've decided that this is the perfect race-weekend hotel.We are so pleased to read you enjoyed your stay. We hope that we see you again next year for the next marathon. We thank you for your patronage.
Excellent staff. Clean room. I am sure they get many visitors asking the same questions over and over again about Disneyland as many are here to visit the park, yet staff is friendly and helpful. Great Italian rest next door.
My daughter and I enjoyed five nights at this hotel which was comfortable and convenient to buses to Disneyland, Universal Studios and also Outlet Mall shopping. Kelly on the front desk provided helpful suggestions for our excursions.It was very much a family-oriented hotel close to the action.There was no continental breakfast available but we were on the go so much that it didn't really matter. I would recommend this as a convenient, comfortable and clean hotel to take your family to with a lovely pool and hot tub. The fireworks from the Disneyland Park could be seen from the hotel poolside each evening.Pleased with our stay.
We stayed for 5 nights with our 2 children, we arrived from australia at 10am and were very grateful to get an early checkin, the motel is a long walk from disneyland and the easiest way to get there is by the art bus which comes every 20 minutes. Our room was clean and services everyday and the kids loved the pool, we did find the room was very hot though and the air conditioning was too noisy to use over night. If we were returning to Anaheim we would chose a hotel directly across from disneyland to make it easier to return to the room during the day.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Pavilions. We are pleased you enjoyed our hotel and look forward to seeing you again on your next trip to the Anaheim area. Thank you again.
The hotel is located on the southeast corner of Walnut and West Katella (opposite of the Disneyland property on the Disneyland hotel side, to the right of the Denny's restaurant). The hotel lobby is located at the front of the property next to the high carport. The lobby looks beautiful, clean, and organized. This is where you get the grab and go breakfast. They do not have a continental breakfast, however you can get a brown paper bag and fill it with granola bars, juice boxes, fruit, yogurt, and pre-packaged pastries. There is also a business center here with two computers and a printer where you can print anything you need for your trip. They also have bathrooms for you to use when you check in. The property also has high-speed free Internet which works very well in the rooms. We stayed in room 204 which is at the back of the property, and our Internet connection was very strong. Check-in time is 3:00 pm and check-out time is 12:00 pm. The hotel is 100 smoke free. If you smoke in the rooms you will be charged 250/night extra. They have free parking and will give you a parking pass for your vehicle when you check-in. Part of the charge when you check-in is a 5/day resort fee. This is a mandatory fee that almost all hotels have. The taxes on the room are 17. The hotel is not pet friendly so don't bring your pet. The property is divided into two buildings the front building is the main building. This is where the laundromat is located on the second floor. The laundromat is open from 9 am-9 pm every day. It costs 2.00 to wash and 2.00 to dry your clothes. The gym is located in the main building next to the laundromat on the second floor. It is open from 8 am-10pm. The main building has an elevator to take you to the second floor. The second building does not have an elevator. The main building has a soda vending machine and ice machine by the elevator on the ground floor. The vending machines here take credit cards and cash as payment. The back building has a soda vending machine, snack vending machine and ice machine in the middle of the building on the ground floor. You can only use cash. Every few doors you will see garbage cans. The property is very neat and clean. There are a lot of plants so it looks lush. The pool is open from 8:00am-10:00pm. The pool is heated and it has a jacuzzi. The pool area is well maintained (cleaned everyday) with a lot of plants around it. It also has a small cabana with a table and chairs and a few umbrella tables with chairs. There is also a vending machine here. Entrances to the rooms are external meaning your door is outside. It's not inside the building. Our room was 204. It is located in the middle of the back building in front of the stairs. It is not a bad room however you can hear the people outside when they are going up the stairs. If you are sensitive to noise, this would not be a good room for you. However, if you're not this room is pretty good since it's located right next to the exit. You can see the Disneyland fireworks from this hotel and the sound they make is loud. So if you have little ones be aware of this. The property is very well lit which can be a problem depending on how you sleep. There is a light right outside our room that is able to shine through the blinds. This took a little getting used. They also have a security officer walking the property at night for your safety. As soon as you walk into the room, you will see a big flat screen HD-TV in front of you atop a 3 drawer dresser. The satellite provider is DirecTV. The pictures crisping clear with very vibrant colors. In front of the TV is the first of the double beds. The bed was nicely set with four very plush pillow's and one body pillow. The bed was firm and very comfortable for me. However depending on how you like your beds depends on how you would like this bed. I slept very comfortably. On the nightstand in between the 2 beds is a small alarm clock and a lamp. In front of the second bed and next to the TV, is a small table/desk. On top of this table is a small data box where you can plug in any of your mobile devices or laptop. It has USB ports and power outlets to charge your devices. On either side of the table, there are plush seats to sit in. They are pretty comfortable. There is also a floor lamp to light up this area. Next to the table and chairs is a small closet that protrudes from the wall. Located inside of this small closet is the ironing board, iron, suitcase stand, and hangers for your clothes. Next to the closet is the countertop where the huge mirror, sink, box of tissue, hand soaps, microwave, single serve coffee maker with packets of tea, coffee, and hot chocolate are located. The mini fridge is located underneath this counter along with an extra towel and the hair dryer. This is now the back wall of the room. The A/C unit is located along this back wall. It is pretty high up on the wall but it has a remote that you can use without having to touch the A/C unit. This is a great feature. The water from the sink takes a good minute to start warming up. There is no safe in the room. Finally the bathroom. The bathroom is small just like in all of the other hotels and it was in good condition. When you flush the toilet, it flushes quick with some strong force. The shower on the other hand has low pressure. To operate it, the handle has 2 knobs. The first knob is round and you rotate it to turn the water on. The second knob has a tab on it and this controls the temperature of the water. Just rotate it to the left or right depending on your comfort level of the water temperature. To get the water to come out of the shower head, pull the little knob that is on the water spout out. They give you towels for 4 people.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are pleased to know you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area.

Perfect location if going to visit Disneyland. No frills but safe, clean and family appropriate. Breakfast is grab and go but there is a Denny's Restaurant on location. Nice clean pool and separate hot tub. Friendly staff always willing to help and advise. No extra charge for parking. Did not use shuttle, as we simply walked across the street to enter Disneyland via Downtown Disney.

The Best Western PLUS Pavilions located in Anaheim, California, is an outstanding value. The rooms were clean as well as comfortable. The staff was friendly as well as welcoming. Disneyland is just a few blocks away, so you can walk there in a short amount of time.Thank your for being our guest, we do appreciate your business and review.
We had a decent stay here. I booked this hotel for the price and proximity to Disneyland. We were able to either drive, walk or take a shuttle to Disneyland with ease and the price was only about 100-110 a night. For the price, it was a good value. But an older hotel. While the rooms have been refurbished and are clean with nice linens, the A/C was an old swamp cooler in the wall and was very loud. And the only way to keep the room cool in 100 degree heat all weekend, was to run it 24 hours a day. Not great for sleeping. Also, there were small bugs that kept showing up in the bathroom, probably one or two a day. Not sure what they were, just kinda gross. The staff was friendly and efficient. The pool/spa area was very nice. The stay overall was good.Thank you for staying with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions.

This hotel is not one I had ever considered when going to Disneyland because it is further out than others. But on this trip I was looking for low cost so I decided to try it out. I'm glad I did! I was pleasantly surprised with how fast and easy it was to get to the park using the shuttle. It was never crowded and often we were t he only people riding. As far as the rooms go they were on par with other places I have stayed in the area. The breakfast vouchers for Denny's worked out great for my party of two. We were in and out in 30 minutes each day and the shuttle stop was right out front. I'm not sure how I would feel about the breakfast if I had been with a larger family with kids, but I did notice you can get pancakes for 2 so maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
Took a trip to Disneyland with 13 family members over the summer. Needed a place that was clean and comfortable but still affordable and this place was perfect. Aside from having clean rooms with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms, the staff is very accommodating (they...MoreThank you for your recent stay. Thank you for taking the time to provide us with feedback. We are glad you enjoyed your stay. We look forward to your next visit to Anaheim.
First off, even with my credit card number, they would not hold the room past 8 PM! Old funky room, fairly clean except for overlayed cigarette stink, cig ashes on the coffee tray, cobwebs in the bathroom, smoke detector removed very little sound proofing between rooms, but that was OK because we had the A/C roaring all night to deal...

The staff was excellent plenty of parking for a 5th wheel tralor good food close right off the 99 freeway rooms were up to date and clean
When we arrived we were greeted very warmly and treated like family!

Dog human friendly staff. Cute rooms, each includes a quaint kitchenette w. pots/pans, kinves/forks ect included. Also a small (gas/electrict, idk) fireplace. The grounds are small yet very cozy. Common area is a comfortable spot to relax for ppl dogs alike. Beach is a short 2 block walk. State street shopping restaurants are a short 5 minute... More
Adorable little place, 2 blocks from the beach and from the center of town. Nothing fancy, but clean, friendly and they allow dogs! Nice kitchenette's that would make it a great place for an extended stay.
My friend and I got a good rate on this hotel it was clean, quiet and well maintained. The bed could have been a bit softer and the breakfast a little more substantial, but for the price I have no complaints. The location is good and the staff was friendly. Would definitely stay there again.
This is an older hotel but my room was comfortable and clean however the furnishings are old. The best rooms face outside as the pool are can get very noisy ! The breakfast area is very small with a bad selection of items, however there is a diner next door if you want a cooked breakfast !
This motel is fantastic. Staff is very courteous and helpful. Grounds and impeccable. Rooms are so clean and comfortable. The only thing I suggest to the hotel is build a workout/exercise room. They do not have a workout facility or room. The Cozy Diner (Same parking lot) has wonderful food and follows the hotel with regards to cleanliness. An upscale... More
Wow! I was thinking this place was going to be just the ordinary Best Western that is sometimes run down. I was totally impressed. Very clean rooms and friendly people. I could not find one thing to complain about. I even brought my own pillow but ended up using their pillow because they were so much better.
My husband and I stayed here while traveling. It was close to the freeway so was very convenient. There was nothing overly fancy about the room. We had a room with 2 queen beds and found it a bit crowded, but for one night it was fine. The room was clean although the shower showed a little wear and tear.... More
The check in area was really nice. The room was ok. Water stain in ceiling. Big refrigerator, microwave, small coffee maker. Had to use ironing board couldn't get it to close. Banquet rooms where nice. There where at least 3 that I know of. ,
As Budget style hotels go, this one still benefits from its newness. The lobby grabs you as you enter. You'd swear you're just steps from a beach but you're in the middle of the mountains.Props to the staff! Carla Bhumi. Once you check in you are in good hands and on a very quality property. However, don't expect to check in before check in time. So, if you arrive early, expect to be told not yet. Parking right next to the hotel is limited. But there is a satellite lot just a few more steps away. Not a problem, unless it's raining. Speaking of which, it did on our trip, just enough to not be able to enjoy the outdoor pool which looked very inviting!The indoor pool does not allow any eating or drinking...eh not a fan of that policy. There is no smoking on the property, not even on your own balcony. Understandable because you're pretty close to your neighbors, but still would have liked to enjoy a cigar and beer in the evenings. Instead there's a rickety table and chair in the corner of the parking lot you can traipse to if you have to smoke. OK, unless it's raining.The rooms are exquisite - for budget style hotels. And you can't beat the location, right next to the Island at Pigeon Forge. Several attractions are within walking distance but drivers in Pigeon Forge are horrible. Some don't even look before they turn and run red lights. If you're with kids, be on the lookout.If you can't get enough Jimmy Buffet lifestyle, there's a Margaritaville restaurant and Margaritaville coffee shop less than a 5 minute walk away.Also, need to mention, the breakfast they serve is a cut above those you would find at other breakfast included budget hotels.This place is really done right. Would love to stay here again on my next visit to Pigeon Forge.Thank you for staying at our hotel and for sharing your great feedback. We are so happy your enjoyed your visit and look forward to seeing you during your next visit to Pigeon Forge.
Absolutely no negatives. Have stayed here before and impressed everytime. Clean, up to date, great value and very quiet. Cant recommend enough..breamfast is good and has variations everyday to give a variety

Normally wouldn't have stayed at a place this expensive but had some reward points that made it possible. Lobby was exceptional. Wood everywhere. Tables and chairs in many nooks and crannies.

The chicago Marriott across Ashland ave.t at Med District/UIC is a gem. Almost has the feel of a boutique hotel. Stylish and roomy, the excellent staff makes you feel right at home. Located in the near West, the hotel has a great location to take advantage of everything the downtown area has to offer. Best part, it is very reasonable for the quality making it worth it to cab or Uber to wherever you want to go. Take advantage of the 13.50 overnight parking in the Rush hospital location just across Ashland Ave and an easy walk.
This hotel is located away from downtown, but can reached with a short taxi ride or the transit system. The rooms were nice and pleasant and very clean! The moment I arrived the staff was very courteous and kind and exceeded all my expectations. I arrived early and my bags were stored in a secure location by the staff so I could explore the city. Staff was very knowledgable about the city and area. The hotel runs a shuttle that runs within a mile of the hotel. The driver of the shuttle was prompt when called for pickups to and from hotel. I requested a late checkout and it was accommodated immediately. I had problems printing my boarding ticket prior to leaving the hotel and the front desk allowed me to e-mail my ticket to them and they printed it for me. I would stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind not being in the heart of downtown and the tourist areas.If you are a light sleeper, request a room away from the street. The hotel is located near a hospital and ambulances go by throughout the night.
This Marriott is right across the street from Rush Medical Center, which is where I had scheduled knee replacement surgery. Many out of towners like myself, who are having surgery stay here, including the rich and famous. I had expected convenience but there was so much more. First, the food is remarkably good and the service was good as well. But what sets this place apart is the staff they are incredibly helpful to and supportive of the patients are are there for anything you need. So if you are coming to Chicago for surgery or other medical care, stay here!Thank you so much for your feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and the food in our dining outlet. Our staff looks forward to accommodating you in the future.
What an amazing staff and property. We had to make a last minute emergency medical trip to Chicago. Arrived early morning and went directly to the hospital. Nighttime came and we had no idea where to stay. Hospital staff said there was a Marriott directly across the street. We made an online reservation and showed up around midnight. The desk staff was terrific, the room was outstanding and they couldnt do enough for us to get settled in. Stayed for nearly a week. The concierge lounge is great. And The gentleman that staffs the lounge in the morning is one terrific guy. His name is Ray. Ray made each morning visit wonderful. He was so accommodating and helpful. This man should be recognized as employee of the Marriott Corporation!Every employee was just great. And the on-site restaurant staff wonderful as well. And every front desk shift true hospitality professionals. While we did have a AAA discount they applied the Rush Medical rate. It really helped us out. A great property. Nice big and clean rooms. If you need to be at any of the nearby hospitals this is the place!Thanks guys!!!! Thank you so much for such wonderful feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we have shared your feedback with the staff. We hope to accommodate you in the future
This Marriott offers quite large rooms, good breakfast (which you can have in the garden) and helpful staff. The location is strange though - it is literally a medical district, so you are surrounded by hospitals, clinics, medical offices, but not much more. This can come handy if you suffer from sudden illnesses, otherwise it can be cumbersome. It' s a long trip to the nearest convenience store. I did not rent a car for my stay in Chicago - and a taxi to the Magnificent Mile will cost you approx. 16.
First impressions last forever. This was my first time staying at a Marriott hotel. I booked our room months in advance of our arrival date. Arrived at 4:10 p.m. and room was not ready. Took 3 people to confirm the room was NOT ready. Spent 12 mins waiting to get a room. No upgrade was offered or same style room we originally booked was offered. Was given a standard room with a 30.00 discount. The room was OK, however the beds were very small for double occupancy and way too high off the floor! No complementary Internet or coffee was offered. No free breakfast either. Do yourself a favor and book at a Hilton/Hampton hotel. You will get more amenities for a lot less . I could have stayed 2 nights at a Hilton/Hampton for what I paid 1 night for at Marriott.Lilac,Creating a Brilliant Experience is our top priority and we apologize for missing that mark during your stay. I understand how important is to receive the room type requested and have a room ready at the scheduled check in time. We have addressed this issue with our employees to ensure that this situation will be avoided in the future. Thank for taking the time to give your feedback and we will continue to improve our overall hotel operation.
Nice hotel, clean, great staff.Very friendly and knowledgeable about surrounding area.I cam for a work conf at the McCormick downtown. The show provided a shuttle from the hotel entrance right to McCormick place, so that is a big bonus, as I DO NOT like to drive around Chicago anywhere NEAR morning or afternoon rush. The valets were very nice and quick with your car, but 45 per night for parking seems way overpriced. This alone would cause me to look elsewhere, if I were personally paying for a stay. The Taylor street restaurants were many and varied, Within walking distance (few blocks) had a few decent meals there, but nothing to rave about. This area is a little too close to (actually considered) the west side for my taste. While jogging a few miles, it it easy to see the areas that you should not venture into, simply turn around and head back towards the university. Did not eat at in-house restaurant, prices are about what you would expect from a hotel bar / restaurant i.e. overpriced, but convenient.
This place is a Marriott but I've stayed at Courtyards that were nicer than this dump. This place should be re-branded to a lower quality Marriott Property. When I see that a property is a Marriott (and not a Residence Inn, Fairfield, Courtyard, etc) I believe it is a NICE place with HIGH QUALITY standards. This property was not that.Room was okay. Nothing special. The room was overpriced by about double for the property.Breakfast was fine, the buffet is priced similarly to other Marriotts. Coffee was average.Location is near Little Italy and the Medical school. Not an awesome part of town and the property matches the neighborhood (not awesome). It's not the ghetto but there are definitely nicer looking areas in Chicago.I will not stay here next time I'm in Chicago. It may be the closest Marriott property to my client but there's plenty of public transportation in downtown Chicago, you can stay other nicer places that aren't over-priced (I recommend Blackstone Renaissance!)
Stayed here on business with the University of Illinois Medical Center. The negative of a hotel in the Medical District is the sirens. Lots of ambulances coming to the Medical Centers. That and the charge for internet access were the only negatives I experienced here, and I will admit that paying for internet access is a pet peeve of mine. The ambulances they have no control over. The hotel has a modern contemporary appearance. The lobby was bright and inviting with a sitting area offering complementary Wall Street Journal and USA Today. Every staff member I encountered was cheerful and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable, with complementary coffee/tea, a refrigerator, and a great work area. I was not able to see any restaurants within walking distance so I opted for the hotel restaurant/bar. The food was excellent as was the service and all reasonably priced for Chicago. They do have a shuttle service available however, I did not use it and unable to comment. Coming back in two-weeks and will be staying here again, even though I have to pay for internet access. :-)QuitemanTravels,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us, and I am so happy to hear how satisfied you were with your experience.

The shuttle service is a good reason to stay here. But Big Karris is THE reason to use the shuttle. He grew up here and is the nicest shuttle driver in the world in the world! The hotel is very nice and everybody tried to make sure everything was perfect. Breakfast was fine. Would stay here again for either something at the United Center or Rush.
We stayed at this hotel after a rock concert. I have to admit, I was not feeling very safe walking back to the hotel. The shuttle said they would pick us up, but after waiting 30 minutes, we decided to walk back. I was nervous.... The room was large and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay here again, but I wouldn't be out walking around there after dark.Cgreno,Thank you for taking the time to complete feedback in regards to your experience from your recent stay at our hotel Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience you may have experienced with the hotel's complimentary shuttle.

My husband and I along with our two children, 5 and 2, stayed here for a short weekend get away. It's very easy to get here by any mode of transportation. 10ish for a taxi from downtown, three blocks from pink line and four block to the bus that will take you to the museums. The neighborhood is quiet with great food just a couple blocks away. The front desk staff was great with directions and the shuttle driver will take you anywhere within about a mile of the hotel. They are all very accommodating and helpful! While there is no pool or great views this hotel is incredibly comfortable, clean and easy to get to. Our family will probably stay here again!travelindreams,Thank you very much for staying with us this month we are very appreciative of your business. It is always nice to hear when our Guests enjoy the accommodations and service that we provide them, and I will be sure to share your kind words with our entire staff. We look forward to welcoming you and your family again in the near future, and until then we wish you all the best.Adam NemirowHotel Manager
I chose to stay here because I had a great flash offer for 3 nights- this was my first trip to Chicago. The hotel is welcoming and comfortable but I hate the fact that if you are not a member of their rewards program you have to pay extra for wifi. In room service- food was deliciious and promptly brought. Fitness centre is small but Ok- fresh fruit available here. Front office staff variable- many were new and knew nothing much- best knowledge came from bus drivers- they were great. Hotel has a shuttle bus that will drop or pick up anywhere within a mile- however Polk on Pink train line is only 5 mins walk from the hotel. Nice to be away from downtown bustle but easily accessible. Hotel is near Little Italy area and bus can also drop you in Greektown for easy dining options. Parking across the road for 13 a night.
Hotel staff was friendly upon checking in, Hotel provided short radius shuttle for shopping trips.. Hotel lacked indoor or outdoor pool, the rooms did not carry microwaves. Maid service was overly noisy during the weekend. Surrounding area was nice quiet and close to Little Italy. The attached restaurant Rooks corner I felt was overpriced but the food and the service for good.
This hotel does no disappoint! From the Front Desk, to Housekeeping, the Shuttle Driver to the Restaurant and Room, they exceed expectations. Not only was the room spotless, housekeeping met me in the hallway upon arrival to ask if they could do anything else! The Bartender is AWESOME - Jim creates his own mixes from scratch and crafts each cocktail individually, no fake stuff here, all done with a great sense of humor and a bit of showmanship! The location is perfect, next to Little Italy and the restaurant/bar seating is indoor/outdoor almost park like with cushy couches and chairs. When in this city I am use to overpriced everything. This hotel is the opposite, from the cocktails to the food, it's quite reasonable. The shuttle driver is super friendly and at your service, upon arrival at Racine Station, I called and the van showed up in less than 5 minutes! On one occasion took us to 7-11, waited for us while we bought water, coffee, etc . When we called from Francesca's on Taylor, he was there in less than 5 minutes. All in all, this hotel is a Chicago Gem. We were in town for the NRA (Restaurant) show and the city was completely booked. 10.50 cab ride to McCormick and QUICK! This hotel will be my place when in Chicago! PS: I was on Marriott Points during their busiest time of year and was still treated like gold!
I was having a knee replacement across the street at Rush Ortho so I stayed here for 2 nights. Great location...and the service is very good. Marriott just needs to spend some money updating. The breakfast buffet is very good...20.00. There are many good restaurants around this property.Jon P,Thank you for taking the time to share some feedback about your recent stay at our property. We are please that you had a good experience with our service. I have shared your comments with the appropriate staff in regards to the updating. We look forward to accommodating you in the future, should your travels bring you back to this area.Have a great day!
Stayed at the Marriott for one night to go to the United Center for the Mary J Blige Concert. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. We dined in the hotel and ate handcrafted burgers and fries that was very delicious.The most accommodating part of our stay was the shuttle to and from the United Center. The driver drove us directly to the entrance of the stadium. The concert let out at 12pm and the driver was waiting or us!!!! The shuttle normally only runs until 9pm I believe but if they have guests that are attending an event the offer shuttle service too then they will stay available until the event is over. That is very accommodating for someone who may not have driven to the hotel or wants to avoid parking fees. The hotel was clean and very welcoming. The staff was very friendly and talkative too.
It is very close to the medical center and the UIC medical center. I walked from the hotel to the Greek neighborhood and it was just 25 minute walk. It is located close to the metro station.Rooms are spacious, clean, and the mattress was excellent. My only concern is the price, a little bit pricey.Marisa,Thank you for taking the time to give us feedback about your recent stay. We are delighted to know that the location was good for you and your guest room was clean and comfortable. I have shared your comments in regards to the price with the appropriate hotel staff. It was a pleasure having you as our guest. We look forward to accommodating you again, should your future travels bring you back this way.Have a great week!Stephanye
Honestly, it's probably isolated with a particular staff member but I am shocked. Front desk is typically your go to person for everything you need but during my stay this is an exception. It's so ridiculous I feel odd even writing this. I ordered a pizza which has nothing to do with the hotel but after an hour and a half I call the pizza place and they say it was left at the front desk because the hotel couldn't reach me. I called the front desk and he stated he tried to call the cell and the room and talked to someone(not me) that said they didn't want the pizza. I told him we were waiting for the pizza and of course we would of answered any call to the room. His response was are you calling me a liar. I called your room and you didn't answer!! I've never dealt with any front desk staff at any hotel I've ever stayed at that was so blatantly obtuse, defensive, and mean. Maybe he was having a bad day but it's borderline childish. He told me the pizza is here come and get it. I did and it was ice cold just sitting there and he was super rude during the exchange. Horrible service.The hotel itself is nice and check in was good. Rooms are clean and overall I would be satisfied if it wasn't for this particular staff member. What a shame.Aleator,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience with us.One of our key priorities is to provide the highest level of friendly and courteous service. While it was a pleasure having you here as our guest, your feedback regarding the service our team provided caught my attention.I am very sorry to learn that the quality of service provided by our front desk staff did not quite meet your or our expectations. Please rest assured that your comments have been shared with the team in an effort to improve our overall hotel operations.Thank you for being a valued customer and we hope to serve you again whenever your travels bring you back to Chicago.
For the second time in three months I booked a Marriott despite unfavorable Tripadvisor reviews and found the reviews to be wrong. This hotel had fantastic staff, a very good restaurant and room service, and the perfect location. Nice size rooms and bathroom. Good fitness area and a safe walking area. I walked all over the area day and night and felt safe. Taylor Street has great restaurants, it is Little Italy. I never had to use a cab as I walked to UIC and dinner. So, I saved a lot on cab fares and maybe that helped offset the expense. The room rates are high, above 325 for two nights and 265 for two nights. Also, in contrast to other reviewers, Gold and higher get free internet, free breakfast. Shuttle is free for one mile. Internet is weak on end rooms. Again, expensive but sometimes rates are lower. If you need to be in this area and can afford it, stay here and you will not be disappointed. If the expense bothers you, find another place, cab everywhere you need to go and see how you feel. I liked this place and will be returning.
This hotel is in the hospital/UIC district of Chicago. It is convenient to medical offices, etc. and a short walk to restaurants. They have an in house restaurant as well, and a fitness center, business center and meeting rooms. The guest rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff is all very nice. The concierge lounge has breakfast, light evening foods and dessert. Its about 30 min drive downtown but there are transit options as well.
I have stayed at this hotel before without any problems. I am a Marriott Platinum member, so I always get placed on the Concierge floor. This time the hotel checked me into Room 420 on the top floor. When it was time to go to bed, I found the bed to be HARD AS A ROCK. I was used to the luxurious Marriott Beds (they sell the mattresses), but this thing was impossible. It was late and I ended up sleeping on the Duvet Cover for some padding. When I reported this they said they would take care of it. The next day after work (after getting little sleep the night before), I tested the bed. Another very thin pad had been placed on the bed. I had had it. I called the Manager to come to the room and housekeeping. The housekeeper was fantastic. She knew just want to do. While she was padding my mattress I noticed something unusual. The tag on the mattress said Beauty Rest, Custom Made for Hyatt Hotels. This particular hotel had not been a Hyatt since 2003!! (And who knows how long the mattress had been there, so it was AT LEAST 10 years old). The manager explained he was sorry but that they had budgeted for new mattresses. COME ON. This hotel charges Michigan Avenue rates and is NOT close to downtown. I could not believe it. On the positive side, the host in the Concierge Lounge was incredible. The breakfast was amazing and the service was great.Finally when I checked out, I noticed an added room charge. I complained and was told I would have to come down to the desk at check out. I gave the erroneous bill to the desk staff. She looked at it and I told her which one was billed erroneously. Then she said what day is that... Good grief.. she was LOOKING at the bill. Finally just said Take the charge off now. I guess from talking to the manager that it is hit or miss whether you can a new or an old mattress. And after all, a good nights sleep is a BASIC requirement for business travel. I will not stay here again... period... obviously customer comfort is not 1.And what did I get my all this trouble 1,000 extra points. That's it, Marriott UIC.. None of my business for you!
My husband and I traveled to Chicago to see a Blackhawks game. We chose this hotel because it was close to the Airport (Midway) the United Center. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean comfortable. One of the great perks, the hotel offered a shuttle so we did not have to pay for taxi/uber.Thank you so much for your feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and our shuttle. We are looking forward to accommodating you in the future.
For those who require wheelchair accessible rooms, you will find this Marriott a very good option. The bathroom size was excellent but the room was somewhat hard to manoeuvre as the furniture is quite bulky and did not provide much room for turnaround.Also, this Marriott has a wheelchair accessible van (brand new) and will drive visitors within a 1-mile radius which includes UIC, Rush, John Stroger (Cook County) and to Little Italy and Greek town - they also pick up!Restaurant food was excellent and very generous
Stayed for three nights with the UIC rate (169/night).The good:+ Comfortable, clean, spacious room+ Conveniently located to UIC and 5 minutes from Taylor street (lots of restaurant options)+ Friendly staff+ Reasonable fitness room - 6 pieces of cardio equipment and free weights with one bench+ Reasonably priced restaurant with good selection of options (for a hotel)The bad:+ Internet was wireless only and was not free - Marriott needs to differentiate itself by making this free across all of its brands. Internet access is now no longer the novelty it was two decades ago!+ No ability to turn up the heat - choice was either Air Conditioning (very cold) or no fan. I went with the latter...
There is absolutely nothing in this town. We needed a bed to sleep in for the week and pet friendly at that, convenient to my hubby's job site. This place was just that. It was verrrry affordable, verrry clean, and close to all the little nothings in town. The owners are very nice and welcoming. Would def. recommend.
Did my reservation through Orbitz so it was about 30 a night. Met three different staff members, and they were all very nice. The room was clean, spacey and fully stocked with towels and toiletries. If you are doing sightseeing in Macon, the hotel is only about 10 min away from downtown.
For a place just to sleep it may be ok. But there was mold in the bathroom. It is very close to the highway but very ran down part of town. There are signs that encourage customers to lock and chain their doors but there were no chains in the two rooms we were in. Breakfast is cereal and muffins.... More
I don't know where the previous reviewer stayed, but they most definitely did not stay at the Spartan Inn. This place is immaculate. In fact, I don't think I've ever stayed at another hotel anywhere as clean as this place! We booked our room based solely on all the positive reviews and weren't disappointed. It's a very short walk to... More
Had a blast , it's do laid back and family friendly. Will try to go back here before I call any other place. They are picky as far as renting to teenagers and young adults. No parting , midnight cut off on any outside activities. 100' from the beach and 50 to 75 cheaper then the places around it. It's... More
We took our 4 month old granddaughter down for her first beach visit and loved it . The rooms were awesome and so clean . You know the old saying you get what you pay for well in this case you get way more then you pay for. The owners are so nice . We will be back !!!!
Great little place to stay but could use some updates on beds and inventory should be taken of what each room should contain....some have more than others. The location is perfect and the place is kept clean.
Pelican Post had no one on duty when we arrived a tad after 6 p.m. on the date we'd reserved. There was a note allowing us to access our room. The room included a small room for watching T.V./cooking and, beyond, a nice large bed. The colors were warm and pleasant, the kitchen, clean and stocked w/ dishware. This was... More
Stayed here for biketoberfest 2015 and this was a perfect location for that. Close to Main Street and more importantly, right on the beach. This is a small family run motel and like most places in Daytona, the facilities are dated. The owners are very friendly and caring. The beds are good, the bathroom shower clean and the a/c cold.... More
This place needs to be reported to the health department. The check in process was awkward. There are 3 buildings one of which I think people actually live in full time. The smell of mold and mildew is I fathomable We left and ended up going all the way back home.
I booked a 7 night adventure for my family thru Expedia but I had to change plans cause our dates were conflicting. I had cancel current reservation on March 21. In the info for the booking it stated no charges will be made if cancelled before April 21. I have been waiting now 10 days and no refund for deposit... More
My husband and I have been finding different places to stay in Weatherford and this hotel is our favorite. The rooms and spacious and clean. The hotel has a large buffet in the morning and an indoor pool.
Stayed here recently to celebrate my anniversary. The location is good, all the restaurants and bars are within walking distance. The hotel itself was nice but me and my boyfriend felt a little out of place. We are 25 and were definitely some of the youngest people there. I chose this hotel because there was a balcony option and the view was nice. Valet could use some work, seems like they are understaffed in that department and its also pretty expensive (42 a day). All in all I enjoyed my stay but will consider other places next time Im in SD. Maybe something more age appropriate and lively.
I stayed here for 2 nights before a conference in San Diego while I explored the city on my own. Location is perfection, right in the heart of the Gaslamp district. I got a phenomenal deal on hotels.com, otherwise this would have likely been out of my price range. It was extremely clean, a decent sized room and great location, for a great sale price, what more can you ask for
I stayed at this hotel while in town for a conference. The main conference hotel was fully booked so I used Trip Advisor to look for an alternative, and found the Horton Grand. I wanted something interesting and authentic rather than international-hotel-chain-plastic, and the Horton Grand really delivered. Yes, it's shabby in places and some of the wooden furniture and fitments are chipped and knocked about, but that really didn't matter. Staying here was lovely. With the benefit of reviews from previous guests on TA I asked for and was given a room at the back of the hotel. People coming out of the nightclub opposite still got a bit noisy on a couple of nights (I was there over the Memorial Day weekend) but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't disturb me over-much. There was worse noise from the room upstairs: the floors (although carpeted) are wooden, and there must have been a family of elephants staying up there! It still wasn't enough to put me off though. If you want a quiet hotel, don't stay in the middle of the entertainment quarter!Service was good, my room was clean, and breakfasts were fine.If you want an experience that's a little different from the McDonald's type of hotel, this one is for you :-)
Great staff.. the front desk, bell service, bar tenders and housekeeping all had a little play in our stay. All performed 100. Great room over the courtyard.. a little noisy on Friday night, but that is to be expected. Clean room, extra towels, great directions from the front desk, they were short some people so the front desk guys brought and took our luggage. Talk about location... walk to Petco Park, bars an restaurants are within 50 feet. Mall is appx 5 blocks. Park the car and walk around. Weather was horrible.. 87 degrees and humid (that's horrible for San Diego), felt like 100 degrees, but the room was cool. Will I stay here again EVERY TIME. Room 319 on 08/15 for 2 nights.
I booked a room here as part of a road trip for 1 day. It was an extremely cute little place. Nice people, clean rooms, and comfy. Coronado is a quiet and beautiful town and this little bungalow was exactly as I expected.
stayed here with the kids, was pricey but worth it, they loved it. The headboards on the beds even lit up like fireworks. Only issue was construction noise outside at Downtown Disney prevented afternoon naps.
Disney has recently remodeled the Disneyland Hotel and it is great! The rooms are large, clean and have many great details classic for Disney. The hotel is steps away from Downtown Disney and the Monorail.
We had a good time during our stay. You can have an hour exclusive-to-hotel-guests entrance prior to park opening hours to the Disneyland and California adventure if you stay here. The parks are walking distance from the hotel so time-saving too.
So this place is filthy and gross......not to mention the needle that was found in my room....when management was informed they said they would remove it.....I asked for my money back and was denied anything...I told them I have pictures and video of this needle that I will post online...they said go ahead and call the police while I was...

Stay at the Lodi Best Western in California was very good. The lady at check in, Maria was outstanding and very helpful - Breakfast was also good - The room was good, and the bed also , Internet was good and fast
We stayed in a standard king room which was more than adequate for our needs. Very spacious, great bed and bathroom. The location was great, very central to many attractions. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. I would definitely recommend to stay at the Orchard Garden.Thanks for the praise! Were always happy to go above and beyond, Suzanne. Give us a call if you're ever visiting San Francisco again, we'd be more than happy to help you with accommodations. Best,Pablo B. General Manager
My wife and I spent lots of time searching for hotels in San Francisco - we were travelling to the city for our 10th wedding anniversay, so we wanted something special. We were really worried by some of the reviews of other hotels (too noisy, poor location, bad smells, poor service, etc.). By chance, we happened upon a review of the Orchard Garden Hotel. It looked good via the website and our initial contact with staff on the booking line was positive. So we took a chance. It helped that the hotel promoted its eco-credentials.When we got there, we were really pleased with our choice. Just steps away from the China Town gate, a few minutes from Union Square and about 10 minutes walk from the nearest BART station - so plenty of bustle if we wanted. However, the road the hotel is on is a relatively quiet one and this is helped by really good double-glazing (as you might expect from an eco-hotel). To be fair, we were staying on the 9th floor. But the room ventilation was quiet and there were no other noises to disturb our sleep - beds are really comfortable, too.The rooms are very nice with a good, clean and light decor. Nicely appointed, too. We ate in the restaurant the first night - the food is very good but, as you might expect from a hotel in SF, quite expensive. We knew it would be and it didn't detract from the experience. We ate breakfast at one of the many cafes in the area - once again, this hotel is in a good location.The staff are friendly and genuinely welcoming with good local knowledge. There is even a little room with a couple of PCs and a printer for Internet access.In conclusion, we are really happy with our choice of hotel and will defintely make this our hotel of choice for our next trip to SF. I thoroughly recommend the Orchard Garden.
This is by far the best hotel in the USA we ever stayed in. Who cares the view on some backyard from the window. Not one sound from the busy Bush Street can be heard. The rooms on front should be sound proof according the hotel staff. The breakfast is basic and rather expensive. Cold hard boiled eggs, bread, coffee or tea and juices from the bottle and of course some cereals. For additionals high priced extras can be ordered. We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The dinner food is great, but the choice very limited, so we had to go to the French restaurant Restaurant de la Presse on the opposite of the entrance in Bush Street. One remark about the sound proof quality of our room. At one moment it looked like our neighbours were really inside our room. They had a normal conversation and we could understand every word of it!!! So we were just lucky with quiet neighbours who did not shout or laughed loud or put on the TV set maximum! You better go for a room without connecting doors.The hotel is extremely green and was awarded for this, too. Free WiFi, which works fast all the time.A special compliment to the porters, who proved to be very helpful with good tips.
This hotel is really great, the location is near to everything: Union Sqare shopping, Cablecar, Financial district and Downtown, etc...Hotel itself is clean and nice and not noisy at all (in comparison to other hotels). We enjoyed our week long stay and would definitely return here the next time around!BTW: go and check the terrace with a great view that let's you relax for a bit during the content-packed days.
Great location in the city next to the Dragon Gate of Chinatown. Nicely sized rooms with comfy beds and lots of pillows. The staff were all friendly and helpful, with an extra shout out to Anthony and Andrew!I'll be sure to pass along your compliments to Anthony and Andrew -- I'm sure they'll really appreciate that! Thank you so much for taking the time to pass along the kind word as well -- I'm thrilled you enjoyed your stay so much. Hope to see you on your next trip to San Francisco!Best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
If you want a luxurious sleep - outstanding service and a reasonable - well for San Francisco - downright bargain - price -- The Orchard Garden Inn is hard to beat -- beautiful all green hotel -- outstanding 5 star hotel like service -- right at the gate of Chinatown - easy walking distance to virtually everywhere on the bay bridge side of the city. The rooms are cozy - modern - clean - the beds are amazing - so comfortable you don't want to get up. Would highly recommend this gem.
Location is great, right on the edge of Chinatown with Union Square and Columbus Avenue both within easy walking distance. We didn't try the food always went out - plenty of restaurants (breakfast cafes) within easy walking distance. Rooms are small but well equipped - the bathroom was as big as the bedroom.
The service was wonderful. Always cheerful and very helpful. This is quite important to me. The hotel is nice, but the tv had a very bad picture. It was an off brand. I'm not usually in the room much, so not hat big of a deal to me. If coffee is important in your room, you may want to bring your own or head out, as it's quite awful. Starbucks is almost across the street :) I also had a very difficult time with wifi reception in my room. I did accidentally lock my belongings in the safe without my code entered and they responded almost immediately to assist. Take note, the safe functions completely differently than any others I've ever used. Our friends did the same thing in their room. Valet is quite expensive, 40 per nt., but I'm sure parking is at a premium. We didn't need our car at all during our stay, as so much is within walking distance and there is a good bit of public transportation. Located right outside of the entrance to China Town.The bed was quite comfortable and we would choose this hotel again.
We stayed at this hotel over St. Patrick's day. The experience was fantastic! The staff were polite and helpful. The rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable. I also liked some of the environmentally friendly features that are built in. The rooftop patio was quite enjoyable. I will definitely stay there again.I'm happy you all decided to stay with us over St. Patrick's Day, and it's great to hear that you thought our staff and rooms were impressive. It means a lot that you'll stay with us again. We can't wait!Warm regards,Pablo B. General Manager
The room is clean and nice. Service is good too. The hotel is right next to the Chinatown, convenient to get Chinese food, and of course many other foods in downtown. There are convenient stores such as 7-11 nearby.Earning your stamp of approval means more than you know, Liwei! Anytime you're visiting San Francisco, I hope we'll be lucky enough to be your hotel of choice. All the best, Collins C., Front Office Manager
I really enjoyed this little hotel. The staff was great, the place was clean, the location was convenient and best of all, it was quiet. I would recommend this hotel and if planning to visit SF again, would definitely book with them.
Check in at this beautiful hotel was effortless, professional and helpful. I asked for two restaurant recommendations and both were winners! We stayed four nights in room 804 which at first glance appeared smaller than expected, but, as it turned out, was just the right size for our two overhead sized suitcases to place on the luggage racks. The room includes a desk with chair, a refrigerator, a small three drawer chest, two night tables, a nice sized closet with lots of hangers, room safe, and a most comfortable bed. Water pressure in the shower was not so good. Wake-up call service did not happen on one of the two mornings that we had requested. Our room was immaculate, linens were great, lighting, both natural and artificial was really good and the location was absolutely perfect!! Within walking distance to many attractions and less than a two minute walk to China Town! Breakfast was included with our room. The restaurant is beautiful and relaxing and the server, Worem, is exceptionally welcoming, warm, and most attentive. Breakfast was a hit and miss, one day perfect and the remaining days, sadly, off. Highly recommend visiting Alcatraz, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory at 56 Ross Alley in China Town and of course, walking around China Town.It's fantastic to hear you had an effortless stay! We're always so happy to give any recommendations, and we're glad they ended up working out for you. Please keep us in mind the next time you're in San Francisco. It would be great to see you back. Sincerely,Pablo B. General Manager
Very nice hotel, quiet, good service and clean rooms. Yes it is expensive but location is fantastic, service is very good so don t complain , you know price in advance and you are in Center of San Francisco.We are so pleased to read you had such an enjoyable visit. True parts of the year are pricier than others, but we do our best to ensure the same good service all year round. Our housekeeping team works thoroughly to make certain rooms are clean and tidy while the front office shares their knowledge of the city and gets folks pointed in the right direction. All of us here hope to see you again in the near future.Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
My husband, and I just visited San Francisco last weekend. We stayed two nights at The Orchard Garden Hotel, and we were very pleased with our stay. The hotel was clean, roomy, comphy beds, and the staff was very friendly, and very helpful directing us to different locations. I would definitely stay here again!!!Hearing that you'd definitely stay with us again has put a smile on my face. I'm thrilled that everything form the service to the room were well enjoyed by you and your husband! I certainly hope that we'll be seeing you back again soon.Safe travels,Collins C., Front Office Manager
I thought this was an above average hotel in a fantastic location.Room: Modern, clean, very comfortable and quiet rooms. They are slightly small but this is typical for hotels I have stayed in in SF. The discreet in-room recycling bins were a nice touch.Hotel Facilities: Not much. There is a very small fitness room and 'business centre'. We didn't use the restaurant - there are excellent dinning options very near by. The staff were helpful. Location: Great location near Union Square and Chinatown. SF is a very easy city to explore - tip: buy a MUNI pass and use it hop on and off the regular busses and the cable cars, too!
Right on the doorstep of Chinatown, good walk to the wharf area. Very easy to stop outside and drop bags off. We got rid of our car otherwise parking is 55 per night so beware if you are driving here. All staff were brilliant, room was clean and ready to go. Fitness room just about served its purpose, but only 3 machines, could be a problem at rush hour. We're happy you had such a nice stay with us, Ikorel! It sounds like you enjoyed everything from our rooms to our staff. Stop back in again soon. We'd love to have you.Best,Pablo B. General Manager
Only small glitch was the breakfast in hotel. Ordered egg which was warm not hotel. Going back there soon so will eat at cafe next door! Hotel quiet and clean. Staff extremely pleasant and helpful. wifi in room great
First time staying at this hotel, last minute booking. Usually stay at the Parc 55 Hotel or the Westin, this boutique hotel is hands down a much better experience from the friendly staff and easy check in to the comfy bed and nice clean and spacious room. Great location next to the gateway into China Town yet still fairly quiet even on the 3rd floor.Dear Irma,Thank you for your compliments. I am grateful that you chose the Orchard Garden hotel. It is nice to know that you enjoyed our accommodations and our entire team. We love our location as it is only a few blocks away from a lot of the attractions in the city.When you are visiting San Francisco in the future we hope to see you at the Orchard Garden hotel.Sincerely,Bruce PinckneyFront Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel
It's not the swankiest hotel in San Francisco but it's in a good location and reasonably priced in the area (compared to other 400+/night). It's right down the street from Chinatown gate so you can easily grab some dim sum for brunch, close to cable car line that takes you to Fisherman Wharf, and close to Union Square shopping. Service was great- I arrived much earlier than normal check-in 11am fortunately they had a room available to check in to which was much appreciated. Room was very clean and comfortable. We also received 10 free minibar which was a nice bonus. Overall a nice stay for our one night in San Francisco.
My husband and I go to San Francisco frequently to visit our son. This was the first time that we stayed at the Orchard Garden. The room was nice, the friendliness and service was even better. We always enjoy a walk through China Town which made to location of the hotel very convenient for us.I'm so pleased that you and your husband finally got a chance to stay with us, Terry! I couldn't agree more that a walk through China Town is a must while visiting San Francisco, so I'm glad that you enjoyed our proximity to the gate. I hope we'll have the pleasure of seeing you the next time you're in town!All the best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
What a great boutique hotel, just outside the entrance to ChinaTown. Just can't beat the location, which is walking distance to everything. Really nice rooms and service. No realy separate bar area, and I didn't eat there. But, you can walk everywhere from here, so no matter. Recommend the rooms and location.Thank you for the great review. I am so pleased to read that you stay was a good one. I could not agree more about the location. Many points of interest are an easy walk from the hotel. The others are a simple bus or cable car ride away. We truly appreciate you sharing your experience and recommending our hotel. CheersQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
Steps away from the Dragon Gate entrance into Chinatown, this modern, environmentally friendly hotel was a great place to stay. The staff at the front desk, the bellman, and the waitstaff were helpful, friendly, and courteous. The rooms were very quiet on the ninth floor. Bedding was comfortable and shower facilities acceptable. Requests were prompt. Breakfast downstairs seemed pricey until you realized it came with juice, fruit, and coffee. Not one complaint on the quality or service. The location is close to Union Square, Chinatown, and the Financial District. I would highly recommend this hotel.Dear guest Emmacakes,Your comment is well appreciated and will be shared with all team members so they read the great feedback from our guests. Breakfast is an experience in itself and well worth the value considering all the extra additions we provide.Looking forward to welcoming you back soon, Pablo B. General Manager
Stayed here for business so unsure what the normal rate is but this was pretty cheap compared to others so it was a good value. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Bathroom is average with average shower. I liked the slippers and robe. Lobby is small and service was fine. My main complaint is the fitness center is very small with only three cardio machines and know weights. They offer passes at another gym for 15. Good location near china town and financial district. Overall pretty decent hotel. I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay with us, Aditya! Our staff is here to make your stay better, so don't hesitate to ask them if you have any questions or concerns. As for the fitness center, I apologize that it wasn't quite big enough for you. As you mentioned, we have discounted passes to a local gym. However, space is tight, so we're limited in our ability to expand it. If there's anything else we can do to make your next experience a five-star one, please don't hesitate to reach out. All the best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Place has a very nice vibe with many different kinds of guests. We have stayed here for years. Easy walk down to ferry building and bay. We now have young relatives living nearby.Thank you for your years of support, Lewin -- we're delighted you've counted on us for so many stays! Moreso, it's fantastic that you have family to visit now when you come to town. We can't wait to welcome you back next time.Wishing you all the best,The Orchard Garden Hotel
What a great surprise. Had to book a hotel at the last (LAST) minute and selected Orchard. The hotel is fantastic. Very clean and modern with well appointed rooms. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the rooms and bathroom had plenty of space and I never felt crowded.Most of all, the doorman and staff were the friendliest I ever encountered. I stayed three nights and the staff was fantastic every night.Next time I am out in SF, I will be seeking out this hotel. It is definitely on my go-to list.We're glad you could find a cozy room here in a pinch, Anthony! Furthermore, it's fantastic that our service staff and doorman made you feel right at home. We'd love to welcome you back the next time you visit San Francisco.Wishing you all the best,The Orchard Garden Hotel
Clean, comfortable beds, nice enough bathroom. Will stay here again next time. Good restaurants nearby. A bar accross the street. Chipottle one block away. EO restaurant two blocks away. Chinatown around the corner. 2 Starbucks one block away. Rent-a-car 7 blocks away. Walking distance to cool places like the Apple store, Market street, etc. This was my first time in San Francisco.I'm thrilled to know you had such a great time during your first visit to San Francisco, Odi! I'm honored to know we were your hotel of choice, and I'd love nothing more than the chance to host you again. Here's hoping we'll be seeing you back again sooner than later!Safe travels,Collins C., Front Office Manager
The staff at the Orchard Garden Hotel is very interested in getting to know their guests. Finding out where they have traveled and why they are visiting San Francisco. The staff does make a lot of suggestions for sites and things to do, all very welcomed. I did wish the hotel provided free bottle water in the room. Breakfast was reasonably priced for being in a big city, the staff is very attentive.I'm thrilled that you found our staff so helpful and welcoming, Batrik -- that's exactly as it should be! As for the bottled water, we believe that providing these would go against our green initiative goals. That being said, I'm so pleased that the rest of your stay was enjoyable! Safe travels home, and we look forward to welcoming you back to San Francisco.Best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
Excellent location. Walking distance Embarcadero, Union square, trollies. Beside entrance to China town. Quaint rooftop patio. Check in and check out went smooth. Parking expensive, 55, but norm for central San Francisco. Smart TV's, can log in for Netflix etc. Esteban, having access to all your favorite shows is a must for those days you want to lay in bed a little longer, but it sounds like you did a lot of exploring during your trip. Thanks for the great review. We'd love to see you back for a stay soon. Until next time,Pablo B. General Manager
I wish I had the opportunity to rate my experience at this hotel, but I never got the chance to even book my reservation.I had done a lot of resarch on hotels for my upcoming visit to San Francisco in two months, and was very pleased to find the Orchard Garden Hotel. When I did more research, I discovered in the specials section of their website that they offer a discounted rate of 149 for a superior king room when you book three consecutive nights (San Francisco Triple Play special valid through 8/31). When I clicked on this special and attempted to book my stay, however, it only offered me the room at the regular rate of 213 a night, 64 more a night!Assuming this was just an error with the website, I called the reservations desk. They couldn't explain why I couldn't book at that rate either so they transferred me directly to the hotel. The hotel staff politely explained that this rate has blackouts, and that I must have been trying to book during the blackout. The special didn't mention blackouts, and I pointed this out. The special is worded plainly and said that if space was available, the offer was valid through 8/31. No fine print, etc.- I was very careful to pay attention.Long story short, they admitted that this is used to entice customers during times of low vacancy and that the rate is only available arbitrarily, i.e., there may only be one room available at this rate on a particular date. I'm upset because it is extremely deceptive to say that a promotion is available until a certain date if space is available (which it was), and then not honor it. I asked if they would honor their special, but they said that they weren't willing to and that the higher, regular rate is the best they could do. Bottom line is that they advertise specials to interest you, then try to charge way more. As a result, I'll go elsewhere...don't waste your time trying to use one of their specials or discounts. I'm very disappointed.
Clean,tidy friendly staff,cleaners are all Asian and can barely speak English but still friendly. Street noise is normal for a big city, cable cars stop at 12 pm. Close to a very nice Italian restaurant and 10 min walk to union square.Clean coin laundry two minute walk up the street. Mini bar had enough food and drink to feed a small family.Highly recommend.
Nice hotel. Chinatown 10metres away. rooms clean and tidy. comfortable. Reception really obliging and polite an friendly. Only concern was a sign that was in an obscure place stating it was a health hazard staying at this hotel and that it could cause cancer. upon asking receptionist what this was about - she didnt know!! We found this on checking out - so a little advice to the Orchard Garden Hotel - if there is not health hazard - remove that bloody sign - if there is - then we should know about it BEFORE we book so we can make an informed decision.Thank you so much for sharing your experience with the Orchard Garden Hotel. Although I am delighted to read the property was to your liking, I am so very sorry regarding the confusion behind the warning sign. I will make sure everyone at the front desk knows where the pamphlets are explaining the details.In 1986 California voters approved an initiative (proposition 65) to address their growing concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals. The Office of Environmental Hazard Assessment requires all businesses to notify patrons of such toxins. They have put together a list that contains a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals that can harm people. Some of the chemicals listed are additives or ingredients in pesticides, common household products, food, drugs, dyes or solvents. Listed chemicals may be used in manufacturing and construction, or they may be byproducts of chemical processes, such as motor vehicle exhaust.As a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified hotel we really dont use many chemicals at all, but we still have the sign to be compliant. We pride ourselves as a smoke free hotel. Our housekeepers use green seal certified cleaning products, which are just as effective as harsh traditional cleaners. Rooms and halls are fitted with 2 recycled carpeting that sets off a low V.O.C (volatile organic compound) and 100 recycled padding under the carpet. All fabrics are made with recycled polyester and other textiles without chemicals and are machine-washed to avoid the chemicals that come with dry cleaning. Although the food provided in the restaurant is organic from local farms, needless to say the liquor served at the bar can be harmful to someone pregnant. I hope you find comfort in this brief explanation. If you like I would be more than happy to send you more information regarding OEHHA and Proposition 65. All of us here would be elated to have you stay with us again hopefully you can choose us without hesitation.Kind regards,Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
This was my first trip to San Francisco, and this hotel was one of the cheaper ones I could find. What a surprise it was, probably the most high end hotel I've been to. Nim and Phil were amazing people to talk to and were very helpful in telling me how to get around the town. The room was amazing and the bed was better than the one I have at home. It's about 80ft from the entrance to China town and very close to union square. I couldn't imagine picking a better place to stay in San Francisco.Thank you very much for your comments. We are glad that you found us to exceed all of your expectations. Nim and Phil are great team members and you were in great hands with them during your stay. I am sure you will agree, but many of our guests comment about our beds and their comfort. Please make sure to visit us on your next trip to San Francisco.Best,Bruce PFront Office Manager
I was looking for a nice, clean hotel in a safe area that is affordable and I found it at the Orchard Garden! I'm so pleased. My room was a nice size, the service was excellent and the breakfast is a huge perk! I will be staying here every time I come to SF to visit my daughter. The location is perfect, you can walk everywhere. I highly recommend.It's wonderful that you enjoyed your room and our location. I'm glad you got to explore the area a bit. It means a lot that you'll be staying with us whenever you come to visit your daughter -- can't wait!All the best,Pablo B. General Manager
I routinely stay here when on business in SF. The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly, and it is relatively quiet, especially if you get a room away from the street. The mattresses are excellent for a good night's sleep.Thank you kindly for sharing your experiences with the Orchard Garden Hotel. We are thrilled to hear we are your preferred hotel in San Francisco. I know the comfort that comes from having a home away from home and I am pleased to read you have found that here. All of us look forward to upcoming visits.RegardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
Great staff, great location and great hotel. Right on the edge of Chinatown and the Financial District - it's convenient to everywhere. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff was super responsive, helpful and cheerful. Andrew on the overnight shift was awesome!I'm delighted that you were able to visit so much of the surrounding area during your stay! I'll be sure to let Andrew know how much you appreciated his work as well. Looking forward to welcoming you back soon! Best, Collins C., Front Office Manager
this hotel has a modest, modern decor but pleasantly well kept. the service is what escalated it to highest possible ranking. I have stayed in many hotels, but have never before experienced more perfect service. from the front desk, to the personal service staff, to the restaurant, everyone was so professional, kind, and pleasant. Being my synical self, i can usually find something to complain about, but this time...not possible. i wish i had ten thumbs so i could put them all up. just be careful about parking there..VERY expensive!!
My girlfriend and I stayed this weekend and had a wonderful experience. The hotel staff was helpful and very friendly, the hotel was very clean and new. We had a room with a king bed it was nicely appointed and quiet. It seemed very new. Great location and value. We have nothing negative to say about Orchard Gardens. I've recommended it to several others in the last day.
Great place right next to China Town and Union Square. Lots of eco-features, quiet room with view of the financial district on 10th floor. The room was very clean - both spouse and I are suffering from dustmite allergy and had no problems here.Thank you so much for taking time to write about your experience while staying with us. As an eco-friendly hotel we only use green seal certified cleaning products for dusting and cleaning. We are very happy to able to accommodate people with sensitive allergies. We hope that you decide to stay with us again.Kind regards,Quinn McEntee
Stayed for 4 nights on a first trip to San Francisco. A pleasant hotel and an enjoyable stay.A clean, good sized twin room. Bathroom had no lock on its ill fitting sliding door and shower was a bit puny compared to most American hotels. However the room was very acceptable. As a British tourist I would have loved a kettle in the room, but when in Rome etc.Service was generally excellent from the staff with one exception, which was that housekeeping twice let herself into the room during late afternoon (even though the room had long since been cleaned) then turned around with no explanation when she saw we were there. We used the do not disturb sign during the rest of the stay but what she was doing still remains a mystery.WiFi was excellent.We never did locate the stairs which was a shame given we had to use the lift to travel just one floor.Breakfast was good, but pricey for what it was.The hotel is very well situated, pretty much in the middle of the city.Richard, it's an honor to have been part of your American experience. Excellent service is our priority, and I will talk to the staff about any miscommunication there might have been with our housekeeping team during your visit. I hope to see you back in the states soon! Warm wishes,Pablo B. General Manager
We spent 4 nights in the Orchard Garden in June and can highly recommend it. When we arrived our booking (made in April via Orbitz) was not on the system, however, this did not impact our checkin and once I produced the booking confirmation from Orbitz we were checked in within minutes. We found the staff to be friendly, helpful and efficient.The rooms are very comfortable and we thought them to be a good size. As mentioned previously the beds are very comfortable and the room is kept spotlessly clean.Breakfast is included and the homemade scones are not to be missed. Free internet access is also available which is another bonus.The hotel is in an excellent location and I would definitely stay there again.
For the price, location, comfort, and friendly staff, you can't beat the Orchard Garden Hotel. The location is in a safe and central location -- we walked to Union Square, SFMOMA, Chinatown, and the wharf. The room was a little small, but quiet and had everything we needed. The staff was always friendly and helpful. Would recommend and stay again!Deborah, you really go those steps in walking around the city! It's our pleasure to make sure our guests have everything they need and more. We can't wait to have you back for your next trip.Until next time,Pablo B. General Manager
Our family loved the Orchard Garden Hotel. Starting with Joe's warm welcome at the door, we knew we going to be looked after, and weren't disappointed the whole stay. Our room was spacious and absolutely immaculate. The hotel's location is great for a walk to Chinatown or Union Square. Basic breakfast options, but top-notch freshness and quality. All of the staff were friendly and professional, and they even ensured our bedding was arranged the way we liked it. We appreciated getting helpful tips on getting around SF via the Muni, as well as restaurant suggestions. This hotel is one of the best we've visited in CA, but extraordinarily good value for SF in the location.Wow, Bernard -- hearing that you felt so welcomed and well taken care of within minutes of walking through our doors is incredibly gratifying! I'm so thrilled to know you had a blast while staying with us and enjoying this lovely city we call home. Whenever you're traveling back to San Francisco, I hope we'll be lucky enough to host you again!Take care,Collins C., Front Office Manager
We spent two nights at Orchard Garden. Excellent location and helpful staff. Room was well appointed and very comfortable. Ricky at concierge is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Tai was also great. Be sure to ask for them. Looking forward to our return!!!Our number one priority is the satisfaction of our customers, so I'll be sure to pass along your compliments to Ricky and Tai -- I know they'll appreciate hearing them! As for the room, it's great that you felt your room was a comfortable place to come back to after a day out in the city. Looking forward to welcoming you back again soon!Safe traves home,Collins C., Front Office Manager
Wonderful hotel in a great location. Staff is excellent. Our room with a terrace was outstanding with a big bathroom, bath, and shower. Our room included breakfast with great choices and excellent quality. It is at the gates of Chinatown and we walked to North Beach which is always fun and interesting. Across the street are wonderful restaurants.It's wonderful to read that you not only appreciated your stay but also our green initiatives. However, saving water doesn't mean having to skimp on a luxurious bathroom. I'm glad your accommodations and tasty breakfast left you refreshed for a day in the beautiful city of San Francisco. Safe travels home, and we look forward to having you back again soon!Warmly,Collins C., Front Office Manager
Stayed here for a week with my husband and two teenage sons, I choose this hotel because of the reviews and location.Check in and out was very efficient carried out by friendly and helpful staff, Concierge Staff were equally as helpful and professional through out the week.Our room, and indeed the whole hotel, was very clean and tastefully decorated.There was enough space for all of us and we each found the beds to be very soft and comfortable. Only downside was, although it was great to have a small coffee machine, it wasn't big enough nor did we have enough tea or coffee, or even cups for four people. I did ask on several occasions for more, but I did get fed up asking. This also went for the towels, having asked, again on several occasions, we only received three bath towels! We were there 7 days and I had paid for four adults so I am a bit of a loss why this kept happening. It was a bit irritating and slightly lacking on such a good hotel. I hope this will be rectified for future patrons.There is a small gym and a business centre with two computers and a printer, very handy for checking in to your airline and printing out boarding passes.The terrace garden is small but it was lovely to have a picnic alfresco in the city.I can't comment on the food here as we ate out all the time as there are loads of places to choose from locally. Walgreens Supermarket just up the street and left on Powell. Union Square just a little further down.In my book a clean hotel and location is key for me and the location of this hotel was spot on, easy access to all forms of transport, BART from the airport, trams, buses, muni metro and streetcar. Right next to the Chinatown Gate and easy access to all the tourist spots.We all really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and in San Francisco in general, lots to see and do and the people are really friendly and welcoming where ever we went, and to cap it all off the Giants won the World Series and we were treated to a Homecoming Parade in their honour.....awesome.This hotel has good Eco friendly practices and will plant a tree for every review posted.Thank you for your great review, and as promised, we will definitely plant a tree for you for leaving a review on TripAdvisor! As you know we do this for all reviews, but are happier when it is done for a positive review. I'm so sorry to hear that your requests for tea, coffee and towels were never appropriately met. Although it sounds like you enjoyed your stay overall, I will make sure to work with the team so that going forward they can improve their performance. I'm happy that you were able to take full advantage of the public transportation and enjoyed all the sights this beautiful city has to offer! If you ever find yourself traveling back, we would certainly love to host you again!And we agree a clean hotel and location are vital to a great staySincerely,Bruce P.Front Office Manager
Stayed there for a week. Friendly staff, clean rooms and bathrooms they clean twice a day.I could say it is located in the heart of SF. Right next to Chinatown Gate, few blocks from Union Square, and Market Street, and Embarcadero.Nice and quiet at night, for good sleep.We sincerely appreciate you recommending us and for sharing your experience. I am thrilled to read you enjoyed your one week visit. It sounds like you took advantage of the location and ventured out to see San Francisco. I am also pleased to hear the staff and rooms were to your liking. Our housekeeping team works diligently to insure rooms are spic-n-span during and in between visits. We look forward to the next time you come to the West Coast.Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
Didn't stay here because my meeting was postponed a week but they charged me for 1 night's stay anyway--440--because I cancelled 20 hours ahead rather than 24 which is their policy. Did they rent the room anyway Would a reputable hotel do this Shouldn't the 1 night's stay cancellation fee have been waived They refused to be reasonable. Avoid this place.Dear 699 Traveler, After reading your comment on Trip Advisor I did want to take time to reply to your questions and concerns. Most reputable hotels have a cancellation policy that they adhere to in which case you are correct in stating that our cancellation policy is 24 hours prior to arrival. Orchard Garden Hotel is pleased to offer this cancellation policy as other hotels have a 72 hour cancellation policy. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience to discuss using your cancellation fee toward a future deposit during your next visit at our beautiful hotel. You may contact me directly at 415-399-9807. Thank you for your comment and I look forward to hearing from you soon,Bruce Pinckney Front Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel
Couldn't have asked for more from a city centre hotel - ten paces from China Town - opposite is a good Irish pub - hop on hop off bus stop across the road - French restaurant over the street.Realy GREAT staff - super value- valet parking at 42 per day - nice rooms Thank you for the great review we truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience. I am happy to hear you enjoyed the property and location. I enjoy the Irish Bank as well, for a warm shepherds pie and a cool beverage after work. The hop on hop off bus is an excellent way to tour the city. It is nice to be able to get off in the neighborhoods you would like to explore more thoroughly. I am glad to read you were able to take advantage of this feature during your San Francisco expedition.Cheers,Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
I have only great things to say about Orchard Garden Hotel. The location is ideal and the room was spotless (it's not very often I feel comfortable taking a bath in a hotel but I did there every day). The staff was helpful and very friendly, made me feel very much at home. Wifi worked well. I would stay there again.We're delighted you were able to relax with some cozy bath time, Denise! Vacation is all about feeling calm and comfortable while you explore a new place. We'd love to have you back someday!Wishing you all the best,The Orchard Garden Hotel
- The Location is very good, great bed ( pillow good as well), good room and nice amenities. The staff on the reception desk and the bell mens are kindly and willing to help.-Shower is weak, can hear people talking on the other room. As it is a small hotel not a big chain doesn't have room service except for breakfast... For people who have small children it's nice to have a room with a microwave just to warm food for the baby whoever the staff was great and warmed the food for me in their backroom.It's wonderful to hear that you felt well taken care of by our staff, Miguel! I'm glad our amenities and the room was to your liking. Our entire hotel is built to meet certain eco-friendly goals, so that is the reason for the lower water pressure. If you have any questions at all or concerns about your room, please don't hesitate to let us know! Safe travels home, and we hope to see you on your next trip to San Francisco.Best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
I found the Orchard Garden an excellent boutique hotel in San Francisco. The only reason why it doesn't get a 5.0 rating is the ambience, which I found a little sterile.It is a LEED-certified hotel, which means it follows environmentally-friendly practices in its energy management and overall business practices. If this is important to you you should stay here. You will not be disappointed by the quality of the experience.The rooftop garden is very nice although I wish it had a bar. You can bring your own up there and we did and enjoyed it. I'm surprised more people weren't up there. The location is excellent, northeast of Union Square makes it even more walkable to North Beach and the waterfront as well as Chinatown (next door).The room was very clean, excellent and very comfortable bed. Didn't eat in the restaurant so I can't comment on it. Breakfast was included in the rate and was good if not spectacular. The modern decor and light colored woods I thought were just a little sterile looking. That's my only complaint. I'd certainly recommend it, however.
The Orchard Garden is terrific hotel in a fantastic location. Walking distance to the top of Nob Hill, while also an easy walk to the Ferry Building. Nice people, excellent service. Very comfortable beds and quiet, spacious room. Reasonable price under 200 over the weekend, too. I didn't visit the restaurant, nor use the fitness equipment. Spent time in the city instead. I would only recommend one thing: the rooftop terrace could benefit from some improvement. In my opinion, if you do a rooftop space, it should make guests feel comfortable and be an oasis within the city. See Hotel Vitale in SF or Hotel Giraffe in NY. Great rooftops. When we visited the Orchard Garden's rooftop at night, the lighting didn't work. It also didn't have much landscaping and wasn't very inviting overall. It didn't even really fit with the the atmosphere for the rest of the hotel. But, I really like this hotel overall and it will get my first call for my next visit. Everything else was great and price and location are hard to beat.
The hotel is located in an excellent location, central for walking everywhere. The front desk staff were pleasant, although not terribly knowledgable and we had to ask for information regarding the hotel rather than being offered information about internet access, gym, etc. The rooms are not the biggest, but they are clean and decently appointed. The bathrooms are spacious. The bed is very comfortable with fluffy duvet and plenty of pillows. We've stayed here once before and would definitely stay at this hotel again. It's not fancy but it's clean, comfortable, and a great deal for the price.
I was traveling solo and had a wonderful experience at the Orchard Garden. As others have stated, the property is new, very clean, and has a calm and serene atmosphere. The roof garden is wonderful on a clear day and the overall emphasis on the environment throughout the hotel is very inspiring. The location is perfect - you can walk to Union Square, the Ferry Market and other key locations - and the trolley/cable cars and the Muni are very close to the hotel so transportation options are plentiful. My hotel rate did not include the complementary breakfast and so I had an excellent breakfast each morning across the street at a nice French cafe - less money than I would have paid at the OGH.As far as I am concerned, there are not enough properties like this anymore in the heart of our great urban areas. The OGH is a gem! Try it when you go to SF! PS - I requested car service to SFO on my last morning. The driver was on time and the rate was exactly what I was quoted the day before.
Great location right next to China town entrance, only a few blocks away from BART (take Montgomery exit as others have stated) and Union Square. Staff were friendly and helpful when asking for directions, recommendations. Room was very nice and beds comfortable. Only issue I had were the showers kept fluctuating pressure wise, no fan to help dissipate the steam, and kinda noisy at times in the morning (room was near the back/alleyway of the hotel).Thank you so much for sharing your experience, we truly appreciate your feedback. I am very happy to read that visit was an enjoyable one. I sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered during your stay. The fluctuating water pressure, sounds like a constricted filter screen in the shower head that could be easily replaced. As for the noise pollution, its difficult to escape in the city. Even with the double panned windows some noise gets through. Sometimes a higher floor can help eliminate the sound of traffic. We would be absolutely delighted to have you stay with us again in the future we will do our best to find you a quieter room. Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
I stayed at the Orchard Garden last month, as business took me to San Francisco and there were literally no other hotel rooms available downtown between 75 and 450 per night some huge conference was going on and there was NO hotel availability. So I chose this hotel out of necessity (as I really had no choice), but was pleasantly surprised during my stay. The hotel is green, which I appreciate. Biodegradable bath product packaging (although the products themselves are still full of chemicals, boo), room key controlled lighting (very European), etc. The bathroom floor was heated (huge bonus in the morning) and the room was spacious enough. My view was of another close building, so that left a bit to be desired, and my room smelled of old lady perfume a little. I wasn't able to check out the rooftop garden but heard from a colleague that it's a great spot when the weather is nice. This hotel probably isn't my first choice for future trips to SF, as it was farther from my office than I'd like and I have other favorite hotels in the city, but it's definitely doable and I would stay here again if need be.Thank you for sharing your experience during your recent visit to San Francisco and our Hotel. Im thrilled you were pleasantly surprised during your stay and truly appreciate your feedback. Although it seems you enjoyed a majority of your stay, I am sincerely sorry about the lingering smell of the perfume. All of us here at the Orchard Garden Hotel would love if you decided to stay with us again. Thanks again Quinn McEntee Front Office Manager
The reviews of hotel are what led us to stay here. The staff was friendly and very helpful.As with everything in San Francisco it was expensive but the hotel lived up to its good reviews and was close enough to walk or ride cable car or F train to most destinations. We used shuttle from airport to hotel and never needed a car. The location is right in front of China town so very easy access and a coffee and bagel shop on every corner so quick breakfast is no problem. We stayed here on the tail end of a Maui vacation and wished we had just stayed in Maui. But this is no fault of hotel just personal preference on more relaxing vacation in Maui as compared to having to rush from point to point in San Francisco. Also Maui much more affordable that San Francisco, never would have thought that. Hotel great if this is the type vacation you desire. Great staffDear Mark,Thank you for choosing to stay with the Orchard Garden Hotel. I am pleased to find that you found our team very friendly and helpful. Our location is positioned perfectly to walk to a lot of the attractions. China Town being one since we are located right at the gates, and Union Square where there are lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance. Being in our prime location does help save on the extra expense of transportation one might occur if staying at a different property.Overall, Mark it seems you did enjoy the hotel and the service provided. If you are ever back in San Francisco we do hope you choose Orchard Garden Hotel.Thanks again,Bruce PinckneyFront Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel
What a find! The orchard Garden is well located - not far from Union Square and almost next door to China Gate. We were welcomed warmly and given a lovely room on the 7th floor overlooking the Bush Street. The staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast there every day over our 3 day stay and it was plentiful. freshly cooked and good value for money. Our room was spacious, clean and the bed really comfy. Housekeeping did an excellent job in looking after us. The only minor wrinkle was low water pressure in the shower. We would definitely recommend the Orchard Garden without hesitation. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.What a wonderful dose of encouragement, Sue! I'm so happy to hear that you felt very welcome and well taken care of with us. I hope that anytime you're traveling back to San Francisco, we'll be lucky enough to host you again!Take care, Collins C., Front Office Manager
I have stayed at this and its sister hotel the Orchard Hotel, also in Bush Street, a number of times and keep going back because of its location close to Union Square and the central business area of SF. The rooms are comfortable, clean and very spacious, Bathrooms are modern and well laid out. Concierge, reception and housekeeping staff very friendly and efficient. I will make one request for my next visit, please provide chair for desk that can be adjusted for working at the desk.We appreciate your kind review and your continued business, Chris! We will take your feedback about the chair into consideration. Hope you'll be in again soon! Best,Pablo B. General Manager
Nice, clean, modern rooms right next to Chinatown and easy walking distance to Union Square. Weve stayed in several San Francisco hotels and this is one of our favorites. Very courteous, helpful hotel staff.We're happy you're happy! Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. It's cool to hear you enjoyed everything from our staff to our walk-able neighborhood. Hope you stay with us again soon! Best, Pablo B. General Manager
The hotel is nice and great location especially if you like Chinese (as China Town is literally next door). Also 5 Min to Union Square. Nice staff very friendly and attentive. Bed is very comfy. We did not have breakfast so I cannot say anything about that. I'm glad your stay left you with a great impression! When you're not out exploring the city, we always want you to feel comfortable in your room and accommodated by our friendly team. If you plan to visit San Francisco again, keep us in mind!All the best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
My husband was here on business, whilst I was here for pleasure. It was a very comfortable stay right in the heart of San Francisco. Easy walking distances to various places of interest, with no steep climb! A big plus here in SF! Enjoyed A feel good stay (environmentally-friendly) as this hotel do practice energy conservation, ie: energy-saving light bulbs, lights activated by inserting card key only, housekeeping really abiding by sign: ''re-using towels, bed-linen. Loved the smell of its cosy bedding. The room with its amenities is very pleasant, tastefully decorated, quiet and offered me a very good sound sleep! I like the spacious bathroom and room lightings (non-glaring).
Spent four nights at the Orchard Garden this week with my wife and daughter and can't say enough good things about the experience. From my initial phone call , a follow-up email and then one back from the hotel asking if we needed anything before arrival, it was the best dealings we have had with any hotel. They honored my request for extra towels and a high room away from elevators and ice machines. We overlooked Bush Street and heard very little noise and slept well on comfy beds. Hotel is well located, clean and does things right. Doormen, front desk staff and housekeeping were excellent. Our double superior room was bright, clean and larger than we expected. Do yourself a favor and consider the Orchard Garden in your travel plans to San Francisco. Don't know what previous reviews are complaining about concerning transportation from the airport. Our cab from SFO was 49.50 (before tip) and the hotel arranged a Lincoln town car for us back to the airport for 50 (before tip). Really can't beat that considering the cost of hotel parking in the city.Dear TwoRetiredOshawans,We are excited to read that you loved our hotel and found your accommodations pleasing for your stay. Our team always tries to meet the expectation of our guests. Whether it be simply more towels in the guest room or a quiet room away from the elevator we are here to make your stay the best stay possible.I really appreciate your comments about our beautiful hotel and we hope to see you back at the Orchard Garden Hotel in the near future.Thank you,Bruce PinckneyFront Office Manager
Spacious and Quiet! I was in SF for business and was relieved to have such a pleasant place to rest my head. I had a room facing Bush st. and never heard any noise for the 6 nites I was there. The mattress is amazingly comfortable. The fact that this is a eco-friendly hotel makes high marks too. The location is great for exploring Chinatown. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. The only suggestion I would have for them is to offer more TV channels.
Good, clean rooms. Small-medium sized but the room amenities were complete and nothing to complain about.Excellent service and very friendly/accomodating staff.Environment-friendly. We like that they commit to plant trees for every trip advisor review.Thank you so much for the kind review and for commending us on our eco-conscious efforts. We opened in 2006 as a LEED (Leadership in Energy Environmental Design) certified Hotel and since then we have been thinking of ways to be even greener. With suggestions from staff and guests, we have made a number of changes that will reflect in the next LEED certification renewal. I do not want to spoil the big news to come, but we are very excited. We are also thrilled to be affiliated with a campaign such as Plant a Billion Tees. With the help of our guests we have planted 200 trees this last quarter in an effort to restore the Atlantic Rain Forrest, which is only 12 percent of its original size. Trees store an enormous amount of carbon dioxide and in return releases oxygen, something we think is valuable, especially in the travel industry.Thanks again for choosing to stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
The hotel is in a great location walking distance to most areas, a good choice of restaurants close by, the staff were very helpful my room as very comfortable and clean and the bathroom was big enough I would defiantly stay here again in my next tripI'm so pleased that you enjoyed your time with us! Isn't it lovely walking around and checking out some of the local attractions After a long day of sight seeing it's great to hear that you enjoyed coming back to relax in your room. Hope we'll get the pleasure of seeing you again on your next trip to the city!All the best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
Gorgeous room, friendly and welcoming staff, immaculately clean, great value, and joyous attention to detail are just a few of the attributes that come to mind about the Orchard Garden Hotel. Our first interaction with the staff started when we popped out of the Montgomery BART Station but were unsure which direction to start walking to get to the hotel. A quick phone call to the front desk put us in touch with a genuinely caring and competent ambassador for the hotel who stayed on the line with us until we were clearly on the right path. Once we arrived (seven hours too early for check in), two friendly and helpful front desk attendants went into action to serve us. They carefully listened to our room preferences and put their play into motion. There were no rooms immediately available, but they credibly assured us they could match us with the perfect room for us. They gave us several great ideas for sights to take in before our room was ready (fantastic suggestions that caused the time to evaporate). When we we returned, WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!Our room exactly matched the criteria we discussed. The room was a contemporary design that was sparkling clean! The sofa was a comfortable place to plop down after eight glorious hours of sightseeing (on foot). San Francisco's sights, vistas, and hills were captivating. The room had so many things that demonstrated careful attention to detail. Examples included: illuminated light switches that are easy to find in the dark, a clock-radio with a built-in iPhone connector AND USB port for charging a headset or watch, and an automatic light that comes on inside the closet when the closet door is opened. We have stayed in several beautiful San Francisco hotels over the years for business. But from here forward, the Orchard Garden Hotel will be our FIRST CHOICE when visiting San Francisco! Thanks to the staff and management for an awesome experience. You have made us customers for life!I'm thrilled that our staff were able to take such good care of you. We know that traveling can be tiring, so we take care of everything for you down to the smallest detail -- I'm glad you appreciated those built in iPhone connectors! We look forward to receiving you and your traveling companions again on your next trip to San Francisco. Safe travels,Collins C., Front Office Manager
I stayed here one night and it was really nice. Rooms were clean and the bed was super. Location is great just by the china town gates.The negativesBad sound proofing between rooms (we could here neighbors talking) No view (from our room at least)Gym was closet size and 3 different walking machines.But overall a nice stay at a great location.
My husband and stayed at this hotel last weekend for one night. We were greeted by a friendly desk clerk, our room was very clean and the bed was extremeley comfortable. The location was perfect for SF - walking distance of Union Square, China Town, cable cars!I would highly recommend this hotel for a business trip or a couples retreat!!!Bring a bottle of wine to enjoy on the roof top garden overlooking San Francisco!!We are so happy you and your husband enjoyed your quick getaway. Our rooftop terrace is a pleasant retreat after exploring the city, so Im glad you were able to advantage with a bottle of wine. Thank you very much for the kind review and we look forward to seeing you both again soon.CheersQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
Excellent rooms, excellent service, nice people, great location, Parking is cheap for SF with in and out privileges. Beautiful public places, fine breakfast. 50 feet from China town, 5 blocks from the north end, three blocks from Union Square, not far from museums and Mosconi center. Powell Street cable car to Fisherman's Wharf is 3 blocks. It doesn't get any better than this.Thank you Bruce G for a fantastic review!We truly appreciate your comment of being a real gem and that it doesn't get any better than this which is what we aim to be.Looking forward to welcoming you back soon, Pablo B. General Manager
We loved this hotel. *location, room, service, it has it all... almost.The location is walking distance to The Financial District, Union Square and Chinatown and a few blocks from the cable car which will take you to the Wharf. The room, we had a suite, was spacious and comfortable. Only drawback was lack of a view (we looked into another building... creepy) We felt like we were in a hole with no windows because we couldn't open our curtains due to feeling like we were constantly being watched.The service was top notch... Oliver felt like a personal friend. He was genuinely helpful and anticipated our needs before we knew we needed him. He suggested wonderful restaurants, parking tips, sightseeing info... the list goes on and on. The front desk was pleasant and the bartender made wonderful drinks.Loved the roof top patio... a little difficult to find but worth the walk up the stairs from the 10th fl.We will definitely stay at the Orchard Garden the next time we visit SF!Thank you so much for the stellar review. Although I am very pleased to read you enjoyed your stay, I apologize the view was less than desirable. Our property was built in 2006 on a vacant lot next to some tall neighboring buildings. I am thrilled Oliver and the front desk team we were able to make your stay more pleasurable. I am extremely fortunate to work with such an enthusiastic team.All of us here look forward to your next San Francisco visit.All the best,Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
We stayed at the Orchard Garden Hotel for three nights during our California vacation and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is located just outside the gates to Chinatown and we were able to walk to the Embarcadero, Pier 39, Coit tower, Golden Gate state park, etc. The rooms are a little smaller than other hotel rooms we've stayed in however the bathroom was quite spacious. I am very particular about cleanliness and this hotel was clean, new, and well run. Comfortable beds and pillows, free movie rentals! The only thing missing would be a nice hot tub on the roof! I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are staying in San Francisco!
Staff was friendly, great location and the hotel was clean and comfy. We were there for a large convention and it was close to Moscone, Yerba and the SF MOMa. Breakfast available and plenty of restaurants nearbyWe appreciate your kind words! It's cool to hear you enjoyed everything from our breakfast to our comfy rooms. Hope you'll stay with us again soon! Best, Pablo B. General Manager
The building is well located next to Union Square in San Francisco, 2 steps from Cable Car station. a Theatre occupies the first floors of the building.At the reception the staff is very standard, nothing more.Room I was given (and I was upgraded on last floor) is so old that no other word come to my mind than dirty. No Air conditioner, a fan is at your disposal on the ceiling, above the bed, and you can open the window.Bathroom is small, and especially needs to be renovated.For the same price you can leave in a much better Hotel in San Francisco.Dear Matthieu L,Thank you very much for taking your time to share your comment with us on TripAdvisor. I am so sorry to hear our hotel didn't meet your expectation. Our hotel offers different style of rooms and I wish we could offer you a different room if we have known this during your stay with us. Our hotel just recently updated all the guest rooms furniture such headboard, dressers, night stands and mini fridges. All the guest's floor hallway carpets are renewed and as well as lobby furniture. We are going to renew the guest's room carpet very soon, and also working on minor renovation in each guest's room. I hope you would give us a second chance for your next visit in San Francisco. Thank you again for staying with us.
I stayed here during Oracle OpenWorld, which if you know of it is a massive event in San Francisco. Rates were great, and we booked several rooms here due to its close location to the Moscone Centre.Location - excellent just a half block away from Union Square! Convenient to walk anywhere downtown, or hop on a cable car, although not in walking distance to Fishermans Warf. Also just a few blocks from the metro station, with dozens of restaurants nearby.The lobby is elegant - you can feel the history when you enter, and their sherry in the evenings is an interesting feature.I lucked out with a room on the top floor facing Post Street. I wouldnt say there are any good views here, being San Francisco with skyscrapers surrounding it. I say lucked out as there was no-one above us, so we didnt have any foot noise above us, which others experienced.Rooms are tiny - think of European style with limited room if you have two double beds. Very limited space to use the desk, and if youre sharing, youll have to stack your luggage somewhere to be able to walk around. Same applies to the bathrooms, with some limited space.For summer, there is NO air conditioning. The only way we survived was to keep the window open and deal with the street noise - although there was a ceiling fan. However, it only moved hot air, unless you opened the window.Rooms have modern conveniences - flatscreen TV, fridge, etc., but I was told by the front desk staff that they wouldnt drink the water themselves. Meaning bring lots of bottled water, as the in-room Smart Water is quite pricey.There is no gym in the hotel, but apparently one close by - not sure about it, as I just elected to run outside.Hotel staff are friendly, the location is great, and Im sure its a nice location for a romantic trip - but not the best for business, or sharing a room.
What's best about this hotel is its location right on Union Square. Its in the safe neighbourhood of Nob Hill but is quite close to the notorious Tenderloin district, so easy to stray into it. Its close to everything including the tour busses and if you need to get to the airport, the BART station is also within walking distance and the bart drops you right inside the airport.The staff are friendly and efficient and the hotel offers free wifi. The rooms are fine clean and well furnished but the hotel doesn't offer breakfast. We ate one morning in the Golden Gate Grill, which I wouldn't recommend but if you walk further up Post Street there is a great place called Honey, Honey Cafe.
We recommend this hotel, it's old fashion but in a nice way. everything is clean. There is no breakfast served at the hotel so we tried different caf (best was Starbucks). There is no gym (as there was in the information). A good room.Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing Kensington Park Hotel. We appreciate the recommendation and apologize for the confusion regarding the gym. We no longer have access to the offsite gym. Would you be willing to share where you saw that so we can change it right away Thanks again for staying with us!Megan BrandtGuest Relations
Be aware - the hotel has no air conditioning -- something they bury deep in their website and something you'd probably never think to ask. It was in the mid-70's when I was there and the temperature in my room was fine. They do have very large and very effective ceiling fans and the windows do open about a foot to let the air in. But... c'mon -- no A/C in a downtown hotel Otherwise, the hotel is just OK - it's clean and the rooms are a decent size, but it obviously hasn't been renovated in 20-30 years and it shows around the edges. There is free wifi, though, so you'll save 15 over a name brand hotel there...Dear Guest,Thank you for posting a review about our hotel on trip advisor. We really appreciate your feedback. I am sorry if our hotel did not meet your expectations. Please note it is fairly uncommon for a hotel in San Francisco to have air conditioning as the weather here is usually on the cooler side. Nevertheless we hope this did not affect any future visits and we hope you give us a second chance. Thank you for your time. Lennin B. Ledesma Assistant General Manager
I travel for a work a lot. I've stayed at three of the four Personality Hotels in SF, but Kensington Park is my favorite. The location is perfect, even though it's a 15-minute walk to work I'd rather walk because it gives me option in my (limited) free time. Right there in the heart of Union Square. The staff at Kensington are incredible, the best in the business. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. They aren't the biggest rooms but they're pretty standard for SF. Great location, great staff, great value and nice accommodations. You can't beat that.Dear Laura M, Thank you for taking the time to post your review on TripAdvisor. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to host you during your stay at Kensington Park. We are humbled to have received such thoughtful comments, for there is no greater satisfaction than receiving kind words. We appreciate your comments for our well-appointed guests room and amenities. When the occasion arises please contact me and I will personally assists you with your reservation to visit the 4th Personality Hotels. Your business is much appreciated and we will do our very best to continue to meet your expectations. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best regards, Lilia Calvario
This hotel is a little gem. It is situated right next to Union square - literally a 50m walk at most! This is it's biggest selling point!Union square in all reality, is the best place to stay in San Francisco. Being close to Powell St as well, you are very close to a couple of cable car stops as well (essential for getting to Fishermans Wharf and great fun to ride).There is a Walgreens just around the corner (supermarket) which is also handy. As you walk out the doors of the hotel, to your right are 2 little sandwich / delis (both before you get to the street corner). Both are fantastic for breakfast, lunch or a meal. Highly recommend them. Well priced and very tasty food. They are small places, but are great. Sears is also just around the corner on Powell St which is an institution in SFran. We were told the breakfast was great, but only ended up going to dinner there. Quite a decent more home cooked American style meal that won't break the bank.The hotel itself is quaint. It is an old style hotel but still looks in good condition. The check in staff are very friendly and the concierge (Ron) is brilliant! The hotel has an ATM in the foyer - was not expecting this for a boutique hotel. There are also major bank ATMs just around the corner on Powell as well.There are no in-room safes (bit of a negative as the closets are big enough to have one) - so on check in make sure you ask for a check in desk safe as they can run out. Also, no small fridge (seriously, all hotels should have one for the convenience of their customers and not have to pay extra for it - in Australia and Asia, I have yet been to a hotel that does not have one!).Wifi is free - which is great! We found in too many hotels in US that we had to pay for Wifi (The room is compact but not like the tiny European hotel rooms. For a week stay, it was comfortable. The bed was good. The bathroom - needs renovation. It does not have to be massive, but the taps and shower heads need to be replaced - as they are getting old.The restaurant next door (the Farallon) - don't bother. It is overpriced and the service is (well at least what we experienced), very poor.If I were to come to San Francisco again, I would definitely stay here. Location is perfect and the hotel is very good and not expensive.
This hotel is a great value if you're looking for somewhere to stay near Union Square without breaking the bank. It's a quick walk to the Square, 10-15 minutes to Chinatown or Market Street, and another 25-30 minutes to the Piers. The rooms were comfortable and well furnished. The lobby also provided ice water and tea 24 hours a day, which is a nice touch when you're coming in from a day of sightseeing and need a quick refreshment.The complaints I had:1. The valet service took longer than expected - expect about 30 minutes for your car to arrive from when you request it.2. We stayed in a room that was directly adjacent to another room, and the doors can slam quite loudly. Late at night/early morning this was a disturbance.
Set 2 mins walk from Union Square, this hotel is central to everywhere... parking can be a little difficult however we found an easily accessible garage just around the corner for approx 30 for 24hrs. The staff were friendly, the hotel was clean and well maintained, the rooms were of a good size and the pillows were gorgeously plush!! Very comfortable!
The Kensington Park Hotel is only a block away from Union Square which is so convenient for shopping, dining, and sightseeing activities! We always stay at the hotel because of the friendly staff, efficient service, and affordable rates. The rooms are very spacious and allows a lot for storage after a busy day of shopping. They are also clean and have good amenities that make our stay so comfortable and feels like a home away from home.We have been staying at the Kensington Park Hotel for over 15 years whenever we visit San Francisco...the best kept secret in Union Square!
I've had to go to San Francisco a lot for business recently and I've been trying many hotels around Union Square.Kensington Park Hotel was the best value for the time I was staying this time.Upon arrival, I realised that this was an old hotel. It wasn't poorly but it was just dated. The lady behind the counter was nice and I checked in relatively quickly.I was on the 6th floor and the room was surprisingly nice. The bed was big and comfortable and a big TV with three big windows. The bathroom was your typical white tile bathroom but it was tasteful also. Even though I was right by the elevators, it was very quiet.I didn't try the food or the theatre so I cannot comment.One problem was that you really had to slam the door shut. The latch was quite stiff so trying to let it shut on its own was not going to happen. For the first night, I returned to find my door ajar as I didn't close it hard enough.For another couple of days, the elevator was out of action so I walked up to my room. An unusual eclectic mix of carpets!Overall, it was comfortable. Given the location, it's good value and well maintained if nothing to shout about.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us. I will bring the issue to our engineer department in regards the door. We hope you will choose Kensington Park Hotel for your next stay in San Francisco. Warm regards,
A lovely old finished hotel with great staff who upgraded our room after booking.com cancelled our reservation without notifying us. We ended up in a huge suite with a beautiful big comfortable king bed and a kitchenette and separate living area. We also had three toilets. Our adult sons unfortunately had to share a king bed between them in their own room but they were happy. Good location, in the middle of a great spot in town. No breakfast available there and no pool or gym unfortunately. Dear erica6634,Thank you so much for taking your time to share your comment with us on TripAdvisor and giving us a 5 stars ranking. I am so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us in our Royal Suite after a little incident with your booking, and I am glad we were able to make up the situation. We hope you will see you again during your next visit in San Francisco. Thank you for staying with us.
My girlfriend and I decided to go to San Francisco, and after some investigation into the matter, we settled upon the Kensington Park. We tend to stay at hotels that are fairly priced for their location, such as Bill's in Vegas. I'm not a fan of super splurging on hotels, but then again, I'm not going to save a few bucks if it puts us in a rather unpleasant area. After our stay, I have to say it is 99.9 positive with only a few minor issues.Located just off the main intersection of Powell and Post, Kensington Park is in a great location. If you're a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, as my girlfriend is, you will absolutely adore this area of town, as the restaurant is on top of a Macy's building no more than 5 minutes walk away. There are many other restaurants within that area, and there is little doubt that if you do not find anything within the immediate area, you can find something just a few blocks away. The hotel is also a few minutes walk from many posh boutiques, Chinatown, the Financial District, as well as the famous Cable Cars. Public transit is also very accessible from this location, with Geary and Market St within walking distance as well, and was a very good base of operations for the time we spent in San Francisco, as we were mainly focusing on the Northern areas of the city (Bay/Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Chinatown, Japantown, Legion of Honor, Fisherman's Wharf, and Alcatraz).Getting to the hotel was a breeze. We simply (well, simply after finding the station) hopped on the BART, got off at Powell, and headed North to Post St. Due to the popularity of the area however, actually navigating Powell and making it up the hill with luggage in tow can be a bit of a challenge. I can't even begin to imagine the difficulties one would encounter should they have children along with them as well. It should also be noted that there are several homeless people along this route. However, they do not do anything that would cause a nuisance or disturb the peace.Once we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a very luxurious, old school classy, dark coloured lobby, completed with a piano, and several comfortable couches. Once check in was completed, we went to our room which was furnished with your typical hotel items, minus a fridge and cooking implements. Most important of all, the room was clean, which is something that is of importance to most people. In terms of the bed, it's difficult to quantify the level of comfort, as this is a person to person thing. I will say that the bed is a bit on the soft side, which may or may not be to your liking.Naturally, being in such a great city, we didn't spend much time in the hotel room, other than to sleep at night. Each time we came back, the rooms were tidied professionally, with any minor messes we made taken care of. The front desk staff were equally friendly and approachable, and were accommodating to the strange requests that I made of them. One final item of note is that light sleepers may want a room away from Post St, or perhaps consider a hotel not in this area at all. As luck would have it, Post is a one-way street, and just up the street is a San Francisco Fire Department depot, and because of our room, we could hear/see the trucks whiz by every single night. Despite being 7 floors up, there is still quite a lot of noise. Similarly, I'm guessing there is a Police Department or something in the area, as we heard those noises every night as well.All this boils down to the bottom line: would I stay here againIf the rating didn't quite spell it out for you, the answer is yes, assuming I'm doing stuff in this part of town, and I don't want to rent a car. Given the prices of all the other hotels in this area, Kensington Park offers one of the best combinations of location and price around.
My wife and I celebrated our 23rd anniversary this past month and decided to stay at the Kensington Park Hotel. The entire staff were extremely accomodating and welcoming. From check-in to check-out we wanted for nothing. The front desk and concierge were very informative on local restaurants and making our reservations. Oh yes, the complimentary bottle of champagne awaiting us in our room with a hand written note from the general manager was a professional touch! If you are looking for a great hotel in the union square area near everything, The Kensington is the place to be!
I've been coming to this hotel for years and keep coming back, as I've always had a great experience. My most recent trip was no exception. I was in town for one night for a funeral, so it was a stressful time. The staff went above and beyond and were very accommodating - Vincent, Tevin, Mario Jojit were exceptional, as was everyone else. This is always my go to hotel in San Francisco, as they never disappoint.Dear gregr0y,Thank you for staying with us at Kensington Park Hotel again. We are very happy to hear that you had a great experience and enjoyed your stay even during a stressful time. I will share your kind words with my team. We can't wait to see you again during your future visits to San Francisco. Thank you for sharing your experience with us!
Not a very well kept place. Cockroaches had fun traveling around the room and bathroom. Owner thought it was her right to park in the handicap parking because it was convenient for her. Coffee pot did not work. Will not return.

Loved the updated decor of the hotel, inside the lobby and the rooms. Very clean and comfortable. I enjoyed the option of a late check out. Staff was friendly as well. We arrived very late...3:00 am and were offered a late check out thank goodness. I would recommend this hotel to others. It is also in a central location.
I found this hotel left a lot to be desired:, run down, poor upkeep, not so nice desk clerk. I would prob. not ever stay in this hotel again due to being run down and not well equipped. Better choices out there for the
I recently stayed for 2 nights. This is a great location, very close to everything. The hotel is clean and safe. The staff is friendly. I do wish there were gluten free options other than fruit and yogurt for breakfast, but breakfast is free so you take what you can get.
My husband I were in Huntsville for a family function recently. We chose to stay at the Fairfield property since it was new and convenient to our family. We were very impressed by the property and the customer service we received from Taylor and the staff. The property has a small bar in addition to a well stocked Market... More
This hotel is clean and decent but most of all the location is perfect. You are surrounded by shops and restaurants. If you are looking for affordable accommodations and daily continental breakfast, the Fairfield Inn is definitely the place.
I came back to visit my family for the holidays. This hotel is very friendly and welcoming. The front desk girl remembered me from my previous stay. My room had a desk, microwave, and refrigerator and floor space to spread out.
Excellent property, great breakfast Buffett - everything from fresh oatmeal, with all sorts of great choices to add to it- blueberries, nuts, etc. in addition to waffles, eggs, breakfast sandwiches, etc. The staff were top notch, so friendly and accommodating! Would definitely stay here again!
We stopped in here for an overnight stay and found the staff to be friendly, polite and helpful. The rooms were spacious with plenty of room to spread out. The bed was comfortable and we had a good nights sleep.MoreDear Nicola W, Thank you for taking the time to review our property! I'm so glad your stay was enjoyable.

Ocean Park Inn is right on the beach. There is access that exits to the boardwalk and from there is beach access. Our room was ocean front. Our 3rd floor room had a balcony that looked down on the boardwalk and beach. We sat in the room because it was chilly out and watched the sunset. How great to open the door and hear the roar of the waves. Our room was nice. A little old but clean and quiet. The one negative is that the room was dark when the sun went down. There is breakfast daily. Underground parking that cost 15 a day. There are plenty restaurants with walking distance.
Nice old hotel in a busy location with lots of stuff to do in the area. Parking cost 15 a night which was ok and worth it. Small rooms. Hardly any guests in December when we were there. There is a no alcohol policy at the pool/hot tub which left us not using it. The 250 total cost per night seemed excessive but for the area is probably the norm. View of the ocean was great once you get over the homeless people openly using drugs on the boardwalk. All in all it was an ok place.Thank you for sharing your previous experience with us. We aimed to provide a 5 stars experience for all of our guests and we apologize for fallen short during stay. We appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention because we are always looking for ways to improve. In regards to the homeless situation...the boardwalk is city property, so there's a limit on what we can do. It frustrate us as much if not more than you because we know that can impact a negative experience for our guests. Rest assure that we are taking necessary measure to address this. Thank you for choosing Ocean Park Inn. We hope on the opportunity to provide you with a better experience the next time around.
This hotel was everything we wanted it to be, and the price reflected that. We paid 448 per night for our room, which I have never done before-HOWEVER this was my sister's birthday treat and we wanted to do it right. Plus it included breakfast for 4, so you can take about 60 bucks off right there. I felt welcomed and like the staff truly enjoyed having us there. What a nice place, even for one night. Not sure if they can do anything about this, but there are a lot of vagrants/homeless that camp out right on the grass in front of the pool. Just was a little awkward, but it might not be the hotel's property.We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, happy birthday to your sister! We hope to welcome you back again soon.
Can't be much closer to the ocean, listening to the waves as you sleep. Price is right, clean rooms with great parking. Only real flaw, new carpeting is needed. When booking request the quiet side or next time we would preferably book the rooms right on the boardwalk, worth the extra money. Great location for a lot less cost. Patrick was very friendly when we checked in. Went the extra for making our stay as great as possible.We are one of the few properties in San Diego that gives guests the ability to listen to the ocean waves from their rooms! Many guests also report seeing dolphins from their balconies. Were happy you could enjoy this.Also, the next time you stay with us every room on the property will have new carpet! This process is currently underway and will conclude by the end of February.Thank you for the kind words about our staff, your compliments will be passed along. Thanks for staying with us!
Great Location and clean rooms. I'll likely stay here again. As other's have mentioned, construction was going on and it was noisy during the day but quite at night so it really wasn't a problem especially considering the rate. The pool area is great with direct access to the board-walk and beach.Thank you for the review! We're glad you enjoyed your first stay with us. I would highly recommend signing up for our monthly newsletter to receive hotel updates and specials for your next vacation with us! See you again soon.
We have been coming to the Ocean Park Inn for years. We usually book several rooms for our extended family and friends. The is right for our budget and you dont have to leave the hotel to get breakfast in the morning they have a self serve cafe in house. The staff has always been great no complaints....Thank you for the kind review! We're glad you've become such loyal guests of ours! If you're not already, I would highly recommend signing up for our newsletter for special past guest promotions for next time! We look forward to seeing you again.
Great location. Near everything. Nice pool and hot tub. Breakfast was ok. Coffee was not good but there is a seven eleven across the street. Don't be put off by the occasional homeless person on the boardwalk as they keep to themselves and leave during the day. All in all a very good place. Thank you for taking the time to write Ocean Park Inn a review. We appreciate your feedback and tips on our property to future guests as I'm sure they will find this helpful. We are so happy to hear that you will be returning back to us. We're looking forward to providing you with another great trip whenever you're in the area.
I stayed on the 3rd floor in an oceanfront room on the end, which gave me additional ocean views on the side. The only little thing that could have been different was the bed. It was rather thin and not really comfortable. It wasn't much of a problem, but definitely could have been better. If it wasn't for the bed, the stay would have been a perfect 10 - excellent! The staff was really helpful and friendly, the room was clean, the shower felt great, and I had everything that I needed was there. It's convenient to restaurants and shops, and right on the boardwalk. I felt very safe and secure in this area (boardwalk, hotel, and surrounding community).It was a great stay, and I would definitely consider staying here again and recommending to others!We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that our team took such great care of you! We do appreciate your feedback on the bed, if you could please let us know which room you stayed in we will get it fixed immediately. We look forward to welcoming you back again on your next trip to San Diego!
We stayed for 2 nights in a queen oceanfront view and it was amazing. Location was great only a view steps to the beach. The rooms that we got was not that big for what I've expected since I thought I booked a room with a kitchenette, they provided a microwave for me and my family. The staff were all friendly. Great location. I was just surprised for there was a 15 a day charge for the parking.
If its a beach stay in San Diego stay here. We reserved a partial view room with 2 queen beds( mum, dad and 2 girls 6/5) and wow they delivered. Our room was huge, bathroom a great size and a cute little balcony where we sat out and watched the sun set over the ocean. We were not over looking the pool which I was grateful as in the afternoon it was very busy.The hotel is located right on the boardwalk, and a few minute walk to the pier. It is surrounded by lots of bars and restaurants and only a short drive to Sea World ( 8 mins).Breakfast was included in the price too which included waffle maker, toaster, cereals, muffins, fresh fruit, juices and a coffee machine. There is a tv in the breakfast room which was nice to be to catch up on some news. After breakfast we had a short play at the beach before returning to the heated pool. At this hour ( 9.30 ) we were the only ones there. We met a very helpful young man who was placing the towels on the pool lounges. He was full of information about the local area.We really wish we could have stayed a few more days, we felt relaxed and at home at Ocean Park Inn , we will be back for sureIt sounds like you had a wonderful vacation! Our location is quite ideal for families, as we are very centrally located in both Pacific Beach and greater San Diego - great for easy drives to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, Safari Park, and Legoland! We're happy you took advantage of our complimentary amenities, and thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review.
What s not to like Ocean front, Boardwalk below, great food, shopping, grocery stores close by. Hotel has been recently remodeled which has taken it up to a new level. Very clean with the most polite and friendly staff you will find anywhere. I tried it year ago and now stay there as often as I can. Everyone at the front desk calls me by my name and welcomes me back. The manager comes out to say hello and there's nothing I need that they won't try to get for me. I work when I'm there so the recent upgrade in Internet has been a huge plus.Excellent review! We greatly appreciate all the kind words about both our staff and our hotel. We take a lot of pride in our customer service and it is very rewarding to hear that it made your stay that much more enjoyable. As for the hotel itself we are glad to hear that you were able to take advantage of our location and proximity to many fantastic local restaurants, shops, and even a grocery store and pharmacy. Thank you again for the helpful review and we look forward to seeing again you soon!
Location could not be more perfect than this hotel. In the middle of Pacific Beach on the boardwalk, right on the beach. Rooms are good, clean and great customer service. Plus for pool and hot tub which is great for the kids. Highly recommend.Thank you for taking the time to write us a short, but very sweet review. We are delighted that you enjoyed our property and our prime location. We hope to welcome you back in the near future.
I do a good share of traveling and stayed here as a last minute situation. With the 405 night gouge, they really like taking advantage of weary travelers. The don't accept AAA or any other type of discount. The best part of the room was the view of the boardwalk, but everything else was very average or below average for hotel accommodations.Thank you for your feedback. Our prices are not meant to take advantage of weary travelers by any means. In fact, our rates are priced very strategically so we are neither the most expensive, nor the most affordable, property here in Pacific Beach. We set our rates so that we can confidently say that we offer the most value in town - no other property offers as many complimentary amenities and/or as affordable amenities as we do.That being said, room prices on the beach are generally higher than elsewhere because our location is simply unbeatable. Not only is our location unbeatable in San Diego, but there are very few properties situated like ours in all of Southern California.Lastly, prices during peak seasons, like spring break, will always be higher with the higher demand. We're disappointed you didn't find value in your stay with us, but you may find what you're looking for if you try again during the off-season when our rates go as low as 109!Thanks again.
The staff is great - very friendly and helpful. I paid 370 per night for my room (reservations directly with the hotel), so based on the price and other reviews, I expected a pretty nice room. I thought it was pretty dumpy. There was obvious prior water damage on the walls and ceiling, which was poorly repaired. The carpet was old and felt dirty. I made sure to wear flip flops or socks in the room. The bed was extremely hard, so I did not sleep well and woke with a sore back. The whole room, including the bathroom, was painted a dark blue-green. I did enjoy the balcony. Not sure whether to give the hotel a 2 or 3.I did not partake in much of the breakfast which consisted of a waffle station, hard boiled eggs, pastries and cereal. They did have amazing apples, oranges, peaches and plums.The location of the hotel is excellent. I really enjoy P.B. Just wish my hotel room had been better.Thank you for taking the time to write a review, Josh! We are unaware of any rooms with water damage, so we would be grateful if you would contact us and let us know which room you stayed in. Further, we're surprised with your comments regarding our carpet, as it barely a year old and constantly washed! We will look into these matters further. You will also be happy to know that this winter we will continue our renovations with all new bathrooms in every guestroom!Thank you for the compliments regarding our staff and location - we do hope you give us another shot next year!
great hotel right on the ocean with a nice balcony to watch the waves......clean and bright and underground parking......nice part of the beach......can walk to fun restauarants......safe area to walk without fearThank you for the helpful review, Judy! Glad to hear that you were able to enjoy Pacific Beach without the hassle of driving anywhere. We hope to see you again on your next visit to San Diego.
Our family had a front row seat at the Ocean Park Inn Hotel on San Diego's Pacific Beach. The rooms and service are comfortable, clean and friendly and the location can't be beat. You're right in the middle of great beaches, boardwalk, restaurants, night-life. I'd stay there again, for sure! Steve from Sammamish, WAThank you for taking the time to write us a review, Steve! We're so happy to hear your family enjoyed their San Diego beach vacation with us. If you start missing us and can't get back down here, check out our Facebook page for local pictures, events, and hotel updates! Thanks again.
We booked a Partial View room, and requested a particular room number, and this exact room number was reserved for us. The room is very spacious, the view of the ocean is perfect. There is a large bathroom very new and modern, a comfortable king bed with lots of pillows, a pull out bed in an adjacent loveseat, a refrigerator, desk, and safe. There is complimentary Keurig Coffee and a coffee maker in the room. The Continental Breakfast was very well stocked, and super good. There are 2 large fish tanks near the breakfast area to enjoy. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. This hotel is centrally located on the boardwalk, and there are many places within walking distance to eat and drink. The beach is just steps away from the hotel. You can not do better that this hotel for the area. AAAA++++++
Perfect location. I would clearly stay there again. No doubt.A little bit expensive given the category of the services.The breakfast is very much complimentary...Very warm personnel, except for the lady that attends the breakfast.The younger staff in the front desk appear to be not too informed about local tourism details.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback! You'll be happy to know that we are continuously training our newest staff members not only on hotel procedures, but local tourism details as well - by your next stay, they'll have it down! Thanks again, we look forward to seeing you again.
Ocean Park Inn is in a great location in Pacific Beach, with plenty to do in the immediate area. It seems to be one of the few hotels right on the beach, and it was just a few steps from our room to the sand. Its a very clean hotel, and the staff is very attentive and friendly. We definitely plan on being back.Thanks for leaving such a nice review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and all of our amenities and found our staff members helpful and resourceful. We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for staying at the Ocean Park Inn.
Ocean Park Inn was the only hotel in Pacific Beach that was willing to help us pull off our wedding, exactly the way we envisioned.We traveled to San Diego to scout a location on Pacific Beach to host our wedding. We had a very specific plan in mind. We wanted all of our guests to stay at a beach side hotel, we wanted to get married in the sand, then host our reception at the courtyard of the hotel. We wanted to serve tacos from a roadside taco stand, Two Buck Chuck (2 Wine from Trader Joe's), and beer from a keg.We quickly found out that this type of wedding does not happen in Pacific Beach. First of all, the City of San Diego doesn't allow weddings in the sand at Pacific Beach. Next, we inquired with every hotel along the beach that had a courtyard. Not one of the hotels was willing to accommodate us according to our specific plans. We checked Best Western (not willing to host the reception), The Surfer (not willing to consider any of it), The Cottages (respectfully unwilling to disrupt their elderly guests), Crystal Pier (a simple lack of willingness to try something innovative), Tower 23 (wanted a monstrous minimum for the courtyard and would not allow us to bring the taco stand), and Pacific Terrace (unwilling to host the reception).Ocean Park Inn was the only hotel that was completely willing to fully accommodate our requests. Only they know the secret to convincing the City of San Diego into giving us a permit for a Pacific Beach wedding. They offered an amazing group discount. They helped us organize discounts from local businesses to share with our guests. They worked with us every step of the way through a planning process that lasted 10 months.Quite simply, OPI tried something innovative and they knocked it out of the park!Everyone here at the Ocean Park Inn was so happy to see your wedding day go off without a hitch! It was an absolute thrill working with you, from the early planning to cleanup, and we all wish you both a very happy marriage! Thank you again for choosing the Ocean Park Inn, and please let us know if you're ever in town again!
The location is fabulous! I looked at many of the hotels in the area right on the beach and most were about the same price as this one. I stayed with my family and the room was a great size especially after the hotel we came from in Santa Monica the previous night. I loved that we received breakfast so you have that option for something quick. The front desk service was great though the housekeeping was mediocre. The housekeeper tried getting in our room at 4:30 in the afternoon when my daughter was returning from the beach. The towels that they offer you for the beach and the pool are a joke, just a bit bigger than a hand towel. I would recommend bringing your own beach towels or you will need to purchase them when you get to the beach. They do offer you to use 2 beach towels that you can use but if you have a family you need more than that.Awesome feedback Heather! We are glad you chose to stay with us during your recent trip to San Diego. Youre right about most of the hotels in the area being about the same price. What sets us apart from the rest is our location as well as the fact that we offer a hearty complimentary continental breakfast and we offer the lowest price for secured parking in the area. We know that there are many options when staying in the area, but we strongly believe that we offer the best value for the price. Our housekeepers are usually cleaning rooms until 5:30 pm and we do try to get to our in house guests as quickly as we can. As for the beach towels you will be glad to hear that we recently upgraded to bigger, thicker towels for our guests to use at the pool and the beach. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope to see you again soon.
Was hesitant about this hotel after reading some of the reviews and my fears came to life as soon as we checked in. We had a room on the first floor with a kitchenette which smelled awful - evidently a souvenier from the last meal cooked there. The hotel is very outdated. I was told by the very nice desk clerk (who took me around the hotel attempting to find us another room) that they are in the process of updating Not to sure about that. Hotel is right on the strand. There is no A/C in the hallways and it appears that windows are usually kept open. We were supposed to stay two nights but left after one. Probably a great place for families on a budget with small children. Oh yeah, continental breakfast is juice boxes and poptarts basically. It is a good location though.
My daughter won a charity silent auction for 2 nights at the Ocean Park Inn, and she gave it to me as a Christmas present. The guy at the counter was very personable, and check-in went smoothly. Parking is underground with elevators that took us to the 3rd floor. The room was modern, immaculate, and had a great view of the boardwalk and ocean. The included breakfast was good, especially the waffles. I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff....lobby, maids, breakfast assistant etc. The location is certainly the best in the Ocean Beach area. Great restaurants along the beach. If you have the , this is the place to stay.Thank you for the awesome feedback, and for participating in the charity event! We are glad you were able to come spend some time with us in Pacific Beach. Thank you for highlighting the many amenities we offer, and we hope to see you back soon.
We searched and searched online to find accommodation that was right on the beach (because thats where you want to be in California!), was near all the attractions we wanted to see, and would provide us with a separate bedroom and a kitchenette. Ocean Park Inn delivers on that, and more. We were in the One King Bedroom Suite, and it was everything we could have wished for - lots of living space for a 5 night stay, a kitchen to take care of our own meals (Ralphs grocery is literally across the street), a balcony with an ocean view, and a separate bedroom that was enourmous. Just off of Grand Avenue, and right on the boardwalk for Pacific Beach, you are literally steps from the sand. Beach gear was available for guest use, and we had a wonderful time sitting on the beach, swimming, boogie boarding, and walking. The pier just down the boardwalk is a wonderful spot for watching the sunset, but also makes a fantastic backdrop for an evening stroll. The pool at the Inn is on the small side, but the lounge chairs are many, and the pool is a great spot for kids to play. Breakfast was a simple continental breakfast, but had a good selection of pastries, waffles, cereal, fruit, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. We would load up a plate and enjoy in our room, or on the balcony. The staff were so friendly and kind - we had a call after we settled in asking how our room was, and everyone was very helpful when it came to trying to fix the TV in the living room or providing a corkscrew for some California wine. Always a greeting when you entered the lobby, with a smile! On the Grand Avenue side, the Inn is flanked by restaurants. Friday through Sunday night were busy, and there was lots of music and bar noise, however, the sliding patio doors are some crazy industrial strength, and with the door closed, a lot of the noise was reduced. Running the air conditioning was enough to drown out the noise, and we had great sleeps each night. Traveling to other sites was easy, as Grand Avenue is a main road that connects to the interstate. Parking at the Inn was awesome, as parking is hard to come by in this area - parking spots are definitely on the smaller side, but there were all kinds of vehicles who managed to park safely. Smaller cars are certainly going to be easier to park in this underground lot, but you cant beat having parking on-site. The location, views, people-watching, and friendly staff make this the place to stay in San Diego!
Our first time staying at the Ocean Park Inn. We have walked by this nice hotel many times while visiting our son in Ca. We usually stay at a resort up the street but decided that since we were only going to be in town for one night let's try and stay on the ocean. What a wonderful surprise! Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom appeared to be newly remodeled and quiet nice. Front desk clerks that checked us in and out went out of their way to make us feel very welcome. Loved the fresh fruit upon checking in. The parking garage under the hotel was a plus! Can't wait to return in the fall for a longer stay.Thank you for your kind words, we are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Ocean Park Inn! We are looking forward to welcoming you back in the fall!
1. Front desk crew courteous but very young.2. Continental breakfast is OK. At times you had difficulty getting a table mid morning. 3. Exterior of hotel needs painting and maintenance. 4. Air conditioner in room is weak. 5. This is not a Marriott or Starwoods hotel. 6. Location to beach is very nice. 7. Parking in garage is very tight. I damaged my right side driver mirror trying to park our Yukon XL last night. The parking garage is setup for compact cars. Not everyone drives a compact car. 8. Hotel maintenance staff is very courteouse and responsive. It is my guess that hotel ownership is tight with capital dollars for improvements if they can fill the hotel without too much trouble at the rates they charge. 9. The empty building across from the hotel should be torn down. It detracts from the area. 10. The fire department is one (1) building over. This is good if you have a fire and from a security perspective but bad if they are out on calls and sound the sirens. 11. Only saw a few street people. The SD PD made two (2) arrests of street people when we were there. They were very proactive in this area. 12. The location of the SD Life Guard station is very positive. The beach are by the hotel is monitored heavily. The life guard staff on the beach were very proactive on currents in the ocean. 13. The beach needs to cleaned daily from the seaweed. 14. We walked 3 miles up and down the beach and most of the folks seemed to be tourists that were on the beach. 15. You have many restaurant options within walking distance. 16. Hotel has onsite security in the evenings and after hours.
Upon arrival, we were greeted by David. He helped get us settled in our room and even suggested a mexican restaurant within walking distance of the hotel (which was wonderful). We had a room on the 2nd level with full ocean view... which was GORGEOUS.On our final night, Sachin gave us several suggestions of things to do and places to see. We barely scratched the surface and plan to return and stay OPI... They really made us feel welcome.Thank you for the kind review! Your review will be taken into consideration for the aforementioned employees during the next performance review. We're looking forward to seeing you again!
We stayed here in August 2012 - clean rooms, right on the beach, comfortable bed. We were upgraded on arrival and had a great room facing the ocean. Location is excellent, walking distance to many restaurants, beach, shopping, and grocery store. Small fridge in the room was a bonus. Staff were very friendly. Beach was great right out front of the hotel, with life guard startion right there. Pool was great to have and protected from wind. Breakfast is one of the best hotel breakfasts we had on our 2 week trip and even has a waffle maker!We definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Some reviewers complain about the noise, but that is because there are a number of restaurants and pubs nearby - we were not bothered by their proximity.Thank you for the kind review! We're happy to hear you enjoyed the property and our location. Being within walking distance of the beach and restaurants/shopping really has its advantages! We hope to see you again in the future!
I will combine 2 stays into one review. My family I stayed at the OPI in an Ocean front room and 2 weeks later my 3 year old son and I came back for a dudes week together. The hotel continues to live up to expectations in every way and I think we have now stayed here 5 times with each one being a great experience.The location is amazing and the views from the OF rooms are awesome. The pool area is great for the kids to play in, the continental breakfast is good and the recently updated bathrooms are a nice touch. But the real reason we keep coming back is the staff and how were are made to feel like home here. The staff (especially Benny these two stays) are so helpful and pleasant that it feels like we are coming home each time we check in and that attitude helps the relaxation start when we walk into the lobby. I would write more but now I am going to check their availability for a return visit....Thank you so much for your wonderful recognition of our amenities and service! It is our pleasure to continue welcoming you back and we are so glad to be your second home here at The Ocean Park Inn!
We stayed at Ocean Park for 3 nights. We got a partial oceanview room and enjoyed our view. The property is on the beach (once you cross the boardwalk), so the location can't be beat and we are glad we stayed on-site so to speak as parking was hard to come by.The staff is very friendly and the pool area was very nice. Our room was comfortable and clean. The breakfast could have been a little better. Not too many choices and one day, they ran out of milk and juice. The boardwalk has a selection of restaurants and shops. We ate at Waterbar and it was good. Sandbox Pizza is good too and they will deliver. The hotel is in the Pacific Beach area which can get a little rowdy at night. We had no problems of things being loud and people were very respectful. The actual beach itself can be an issue. Make sure to find a place that doesn't have a lot of kelp or seaweed. That was a problem and then flies joined in. Be selective on where you set up shop. The water was chilly at first, but beautiful, we enjoyed our time there! Walk a few blocks to the Baked Bear ice cream shop - they make custom ice cream sandwiches. You won't be disappointed!
My wive I stayed for one night while visiting in San Diego in one of their Suites with an ocean view. Gotta tell you, we were impressed. Great View, Clean Room, had everything we needed for a very comfortable beach front stay. The Suite with an Ocean view is a Must if you stay. You won't be disappointed!!Thank you so much for the great TA review! It is great to hear you had a good time during your stay and enjoyed your suite and all the amenities.We hope to have you and your spouse back soon. Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn.
Loved this hotel, great view, great location, great pool. great staff. Next to tons of restaurants and a bike ride to the amusement park. Had a blast! The front desk even checked us in online for our flight! Also the free breakfast has lots of options. Would definately stay at this privately owned property again!Thanks for leaving such a nice review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and found our staff resourceful and helpful. We are happy to hear you enjoyed all of our amenities as well as all of the restaurants nearby. We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for staying at the Ocean Park Inn.
Our family traveled to San Diego for a family wedding, we all stayed at the Ocean Park Inn. Overall it was a nice place to stay, rooms were clean and it was conveniently located right by the ocean. Enjoyed walking down the boardwalk every morning and the complimentary breakfast was nice too. Restaurants pubs were in walking distance to the hotel, so that made it nice for a quick bite to eat. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Ocean Park Inn. Thank you for your wonderful feedback on the amenities that we offer, We do hope to welcome you back the next time you visit San Diego!
The OPI is not a luxury hotel, but it is one of my all-time favorites. We have stayed twice in the past two years, and can't say enough good things about it. The location is absolutely perfect- right on the beach and walking distance to almost anywhere in Pacific or Mission Beach. Both times we have booked partial ocean view rooms, which look out on the pool and actually seem to be full ocean views. The rooms themselves are clean and relatively modern, with fridges and small balconies (and amazing views). The free breakfast is not exactly gourmet, but is generous and includes fruit, yogurt, cereal, and a waffle bar. We found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful. The hairdryer in our room stopped working as I was getting ready for a wedding- I panicked, but the maintenance man came within 10 minutes to replace it, which I very much appreciated. Overall, I can't recommend this place enough if you are looking for a reasonably priced and centrally located beach hotel. I've stayed in a few other hotels in the area, but none come close to the OPI.Fantastic review Olivia! We are thrilled to hear you once again enjoyed your stay with us, and were honored to be your go-to property for your visits to PB. Make sure youre friends with us on Facebook to read about local events, see some beautiful pictures, and maybe even use a special for your next trip out! See you then!
Perfect location on Pacific Beach. The Strand, the pier, restaurants and shops are all right there or within a block or two. Walking was a pleasure in San Diegos fantastic weather, especially at this hotels location on the coast. I found two car rental companies nearby with hotel pick-up but we didnt need them. Instead, we took advantage of the bus stops one or two blocks away for travel to attractions around town.The room was clean and comfortable. The desk and free wi-fi were handy when I used the public transportation Trip Planner on the SDMTS website. We slept with the balcony door open to get the ocean breeze and the soft soothing sound of the waves. The complimentary breakfast has ample choices. I recommend trying the self-serve waffle maker. We remedied the lack of fruit with a two-block walk to the local supermarket, storing the perishables in our hotel rooms refrigerator. The staff at the desk were always there and ready to be helpful, a plus since this was my first time in San Diego. Their three-day-advance cancellation policy took some improvising since our arrival date was uncertain.
I recently stayed here while vacationing with my significant and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We had a room with an excellent view overlooking the boardwalk and beach. It was great to sit out on the balcony and be able to enjoy the view and action down below. The hotel and room were clean and up-to-date. The bed was extremely comfortable with quality linens. The location was decent, located along the boardwalk with a number of restaurants, shops, and other hotels. Once we were there, we didn't have to drive anywhere since there was enough to keep us entertained close by.The only downside was that it was a bit noisy at night. There were a few people from the nearby bars yelling on the sidewalk, but fortunately it was brief and not late enough to wake us up. Also, the waves were much louder than we'd expected while trying to sleep, but that wasn't the fault of the hotel. Might be something to keep in mind if you are looking for a beach-front hotel. However, overall it was a fabulous experience!Thank you so much for the great TA review! It is great to hear you had a good time in Pacific Beach and enjoyed your room.On your next visit, if you'd like to be placed in the more quiet area of the hotel, please include it in your notes sections when booking your stay, we apologize for the unwanted noise level.We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn.
My husband was having surgery and we wanted to stay on the beach while he recovered. Since he needed to stay in the room all day and night, the right hotel was crucial. We picked this hotel based on the reviews and we couldn't have been happier!!! We were there in October, had a room in the front with a balcony on the second floor to view the boardwalk and ocean. The hotel's location is convenient to pretty much everything - whether a major grocery store chain one block behind it, or all the restaurants, and amenities of staying on the beach right at your fingertips. The room was clean and comfortable. We were extremely happy with the price, especially after shopping around first. But best of all, the staff was exceptional! Very personal and caring. Felt as if we had been staying there for years. We expect to be back in San Diego a few more times. This hotel would be our choice of where to stay - and don't feel the need to check out any other place.We are thrilled to know we provided the perfect recovery hotel for your husband! You're absolutely correct - once you've parked the car, everything you could ever need is within walking distance. Customer service is extremely important to us, so we are all elated to know we could make your trip that much more enjoyable.

I stayed at Ocean Park Inn in 2008 and 2009. I walked up and down the boardwalk and I don't feel there is a better place to stay. I was on the 3rd floor with an ocean view each time. It is breathtaking at sunset.The hotel was in the process of upgrades during my last stay. My room had not been updated yet - it was in dire need of new bedding I will admit. The bed was quite uncomfortable. The TV was out dated - they were replacing them with wall mounted flat screens however. They were also painting all of the hallways - I see someone mentioned the hallways were not air conditioned - I don't spend time in the hallway, so I don't see why this would matter - I never noticed the hallways being uncomfortable.I used the pool area quite a bit to tan, and was usually the only one there. Pool area is great.I have read some reviews stating that the management and staff were rude, that the area is noisy, and there are people hanging around the hotel. I had absolutely no problems with any of the staff on either of my stays. Each one was consistently helpful, courteous - almost to a fault!, and friendly. Jay, Chanel, Patrick, Sachin and Karelia - made my stay all the more enjoyable. The hotel is on the Pacific Beach boardwalk - there is noise. There are people on the boardwalk, rollerblading, skateboarding, biking, walking and jogging from early morning to evening. The beach is also immediately off the boardwalk - what do people expect! For there to be no one on the beach and no one on the boardwalk If you want quiet and solitude, stay on an island. It's Pacific Beach, it's a beach community - it is what it is. I never found the noise to be over-whelming and slept with my slider open every nite.Yes, there are a number of homeless that stay directly in front of the hotel on the boardwalk - they keep to themselves and don't bother anyone. I never saw them approach anyone at any time. They are gone by early evening. Traveling alone, I never felt afraid to be near them at any time-in fact I talked to some of them. They are harmless. T The continental breakfast changed last year and didn't offer as much as it did the year before (there were waffle makers the year before). However, there were several varieties of fresh bagels, packaged pastries, toast, butter, jelly's, cream cheese, fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, juice and milk. Just like any other continental breakfast FOR FREE. I'm just not sure what people expect. It was quite adequate. I would rather not have a full breakfast offered in lieu of keeping costs down.Again, having walked up and down the boardwalk, there are some really trashy places to stay - including the Best Western that are old, outdated, filthy and run down. Yes, there are a few nicer places like Tower 23 but the cost is also considerably higher. For the money, location, rooms and staff, I can't think of a better place to stay while in Pacific Beach or the San Diego area.
The staff at the Ocean Park Inn is great, and do a wonderful job making you feel welcome. The hotel is very nice, very clean, and is conveniently located to lots of attractions. Get a room facing the ocean.Thank you for providing us with this wonderful feedback, we are so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our team took such great care of you. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
hello! i am a mother of a 19month old boy and me and my husband are both nurses with very stressful job demands and this place was very relaxing for us. we stayed from may 6,2012 up to may 11, 2012 and my heart was broken when we left. i am very picky in regards to finding a perfect place for us wherein both me and my husband can relax and my son can have fun as well.. this place is perfect! they gave us what we wanted, a room with an ocean front balcony with fully working microwave and fridge, we couldn't ask for more! the staff were really nice and accommodating, and the place is very clean..I did enjoy my morning walks along the beach and people are very friendly as they walk by as well. the place is near sea world which is very convenient also near garnett st where there was a lot of restaurants you can eat.. we would definitely recommend this place to our family and friends and we'll surely be back for a longer stay next year!!!We're thrilled to hear you found and enjoyed the perfect place to unwind on your vacation with your family! Many of our regular guests bring their families back to our property year after year, and it's always a pleasure to see the kids growing up. One year we're handing out a bucket and shovel to play in the sand, then before we know it we're handing out boogie boards and describing the best spots to catch waves to the same child! Thank you for all the wonderful compliments - we can't wait to see you and the family again!
Very good, in-fact excellent location. hardly few steps from the actual ocean beach. Rooms are very clean and well maintained. They have hotel car parking (might be charged based on your vacation package). CVS stores, Pizza places and other entertainment at very close by distance.
My DH and I recently stayed here for our anniversary. We are a local couple who just needed to get away for a night. The staff of this hotel was one of the best parts. I cannot remember the name of the front desk attendent when we checked in - maybe Michael But he was great - very helpful on where to dine and drink. He also told us all about the breakfast offered at the hotel and all the other nice ammenities (free breakfast, one of the NICEST pool areas in all of PB!). The room was clean, the bed comfortable and the view was SPECTACULAR! The otel is small which we prefer. It is quiet right on the boardwalk close to great food and nightlife. In the morning we drank our coffee on our balcony and watched the waves roll in. It was an amazing anniversary and one that will not soon be forgotten thank to Ocean Park Inn's great hospitality. We will be visiting again when we can get a night away fron real life!We're elated to hear our hospitality made your anniversary trip so enjoyable and memorable! The staff is also very happy to know you noticed how clean the pool and surrounding area is - our head engineer treats the pool like his own and is very proud of it. We look forward to seeing you for many future anniversary trips!
We had a great stay at the hotel. The staff was very helpful. The rooms were clean, the pool was warm. It was a great location right on the beach. I definitely recommend staying here.Thank you for the kind review! Our pool is kept at a warm 82 degrees rain or shine year round, and the hot tub is perfect for warming up after a swim in the Pacific. We're glad you were able to take advantage of the amenities. See you next time!
Had a nice comfortable stay here. Great location right on the beach and close to tons of shops and restaurants in the Pacific Beach neighborhood. Also offers easy access by car to anywhere else you want to go. The garage beneath the hotel was never full. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Pool area is nice. Super friendly staff. Would definitely stay here again if we are lucky enough to get back to the San Diego area.Thank you for taking the time to write such a nice review! If you do make it back to San Diego, make sure you're signed up for our newsletter and you're friends with us on Facebook - we frequently post specials in both places! We hope to see you again.
I come back every year for a week to this amazing place. Could not be more pleased. The rooms are large, clean and who can argue with the free morning food. The location is idea just next to the pier and there are places to walk, bike, or eat.The kind review is much appreciated Harry! If you'll be returning, make sure you sign up for our newsletter for returning guest specials! See you next time, take care.
I come to San Diego several times a year. This time wanted to try 2 different hotels. Stayed June 21, 2016, Room 319. The check in and check out was a breeze. Everyone I came in contact was very professional and helpful. This stay was a partial ocean view, 2 QN room. I highly recommend if you could afford it, stay in a full ocean view. The partial ocean view means you will be assigned a room on either side of the hotel. From the patio you do get a slight view if you turn one of the chairs and put it right in the corner. If sitting on the other chair you will not be able to see the ocean. Again, did I say it is just a slight ocean view. Being on the side of the hotel it was harder to hear the ocean waves. I would bet that the full ocean view rooms you would definitely hear the waves as these rooms face the boardwalk and beyond that the beach. The patio has 2 chairs and a small end table. It is nice to be able to hang up wet clothes. You can leave your patio door open to feel the nice ocean breeze. I would highly recommend the higher floors so that you can leave your patio door open all night and be secure. As others have commented, this facility is no resort but it is not a motel either. It is perfect for a get away to the beach. The room is modern enough, the beds were comfortable, and a really nice big tiled bathroom. The vanity is inside the bathroom. The shower didn't have the best pressure but it was decent. The shower is big and enclosed in glass. The bathroom has huge thick beach towels to use. Yes the decor in the hallways and the carpet is very outdated but not old or shaggy. The carpet in the room was ok. There is a small fridge to put drinks in. All in all, the room is very comfortable. There is a continental breakfast. (Standard waffle making, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, danishes, yogurts, fruit, hard boiled eggs, and drinks.) There is plenty of room to sit at a table. It was great for us, all the food constantly being restocked. The pool and hot tub were heated and great. Nice relaxing area with lots of pool chairs. What I liked as well is that you can go out the back of the hotel straight to the beach access. In fact, it's just across the boardwalk. There is a life guard station right there. After you day on the sand you can wash off at an outside shower at the hotel. This is so perfectly convenient to wash off the sand from your feet, clothes, and beach toys. Having a room/hotel so close is so convenient for potty breaks if you have kids. You don't have to walk a long distance to find a bathroom. It's just right up to your room. The underground parking was nice as this whole area is always crowded and parking hard to find. There is a price for the parking which all San Diego hotels seem to charge. It is underground and didn't have any problems finding space. You are close to the elevator and can lug all your suitcases easily. There is a Ralph's grocery store and lots of restaurants (fast food and fine dining) within walking distance. So everything is close by. You will need a car if going to Balboa Park, Old Town, etc. I love how practical this place was to bring kids and just had a good time. I will be coning again. Just wished it wasn't so expensive.We really appreciate you taking the time to provide us with this all of this feedback. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the view and overall had a good time with your stay. Thank you for letting us know some areas of opportunity for us to work on, we are always striving to do better and we will take these suggestions very seriously. We hope to welcome you back again soon!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The location is great, right on the beach and boardwalk. It was awesome to sit on our balcony and enjoy the ocean and people watch at the same time. I will mention that there are homeless people around but they are very unobtrusive and leave you alone. I never had one ask me for anything. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. There are boogie boards and sand toys that you can borrow which is nice so you don't have to waste your money and buying something you're going to have to leave. A couple suggestions for the hotel: 1. Breakfast...it would be nice if you offered gluten free muffins or cereal. Yogurt and hard boiled eggs get old fast. 2. Towel racks...More towel racks in the bathroom would be helpful. Drying swimsuits/towels and such would be much easier. Plus it would free up counter space to have the towels off of the counter.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with some helpful feedback! We greatly appreciate the helpful suggestions and will take them in to consideration. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.
I would have to say it is pretty difficult picking out a place to stay from the internet. I found Ocean Park Inn from a San Diego travel website and could not have been happier with my find. I was nervous for what to expect, but was so thrilled when I arrived. Wonderful location with beautiful views!...perfect walking distance to stores, restaurants, and most importantly the beach! Also great location for driving to popular attractions. This hotel had an amazing beach front view. We first at the 1st floor ocean view room, did not like it due to it having a joined balcony with the other guests. Alexandra at the front desk did not hesitate and never asked questions about changing our room to the 2nd floor with the ocean view to have a private balcony. Both rooms were very clean as well as the whole hotel! All staff was very friendly and never hesitated to help in any way. Breakfast was very enjoyable with the area always kept clean. Pool and hot tub were great, especially with the palm tree and gorgeous sky view! Weekends around the hotel seem to attract a very large and lively college age group to the bars and surrounding area, however it all calms down the next day and week day nights. My husband and I felt very comfortable and safe there which was extremely important to us, that is why we recommend it to all the people we know and cannot wait to come back!!!...especially that the front desk staff was very accommodating when my husband surprised me by shipping our wedding cake topper to the hotel on dry ice to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. It was a wonderful surprise and I thank them very much for allowing that which made our stay more memorable!
Great place to stay!After 7 trip to San Diego beach area it was the best hotel. And the area is wonderful with great restaurants and bar. The room is perfect, and the pool and hottub were very clean and very beautiful. I reccomand to all people that are visiting San Diego. The boardwalk is just in front of the hotel, and for sure you will feel the life on the beach like people of San Diego.Thank you for giving OPI such an great review.Glad to hear you had a good time during your stay and enjoyed the amenities.Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn. Hope to have you back soon.
I was pleasantly pleased with our stay at the Ocean Park Inn. I booked at this Inn primarily due to its location. We were there for Pacific Beach's annual Holiday Parade (there were also Santa Run marathons) and we wanted a hotel that we could easily walk to and from the Parade Route that took place on Garnet Ave.The price seemed reasonable. I booked a King room with Partial View for 2 nights. The room choice was honored when I checked in, and readily available for me.I was greeted by a friendly staff at the front desk. The check in process was quick, but thorough... everything was explained to me: key card use, parking garage, breakfast hours, etc etc. The lobby had two very nice salt water fish aquariums that gave the atmosphere a cozy tropical beach feel even in December. The parking garage is underground, entrance is just to the right of the main lobby driveway. It's a tight entrance and exit, but the parking garage seems secured, and well-lit. The elevator back up to the lobby and room floors are right dead-center of the parking garage, so every spot is nice. But the way there is only one elevator on the property, but it never ever seemed too crowded or long of a wait any time we needed to use it. Getting off the elevator and then roaming the halls (3rd floor) that's when you realize how old the building is. You can tell that there are newer remodeling features such as the flooring and crown molding. There are plenty of windows all along the hallways, so it felt bright and fresh, unlike some hotels that have dark, no-window hallways. The curtains were simple and plain. We found our King room (313) to be very spacious. Dresser, desk, sofa, king bed. Patio had a table and 2 chairs to sit down and enjoy the view of the pool below and ocean straight ahead.The bathroom was fresh and remodeled (definitely new compared to the rest of the inn. It was also fairly roomy and had a big shower- and good for very tall people as I saw the shower head was very high. Plenty of bath towels in a basket, as well as 2 blue beach towels which remained unused during this December visit.The closet is almost hidden as the door for it is actually a nice full size mirror. Once you pull the mirror door open, you'll find two of the most luxurious, double-layer terry cloth bath robes hanging for you (These robes are so comfy that we bought some to take home!!! The staff was kind to bring brand new ones for me to purchase).The bed was fairly comfortable... Firm (which is best for your back), but not rock hard. The white sheets and duvet were clean, fresh, and cozy. I fell asleep very easily. It remained quiet through the night, so either we had very quiet neighbors or decent thickness walls. -- A/C unit worked well... too well. Brrrr. Cooled the room down quickly then kept off. I could imagine it would be wonderful for summer.Things to note:-- Overnight parking is 15/day (compared to the other public parking lots available in this beach community, this was a good deal) and is in a gated underground lot. -- The entire property has a No-smoking policy, even outside on the patios. So if you are a smoker... this could be a deal breaker.-- Beach is literally steps away. You are right there.-- Continental breakfast includes a fancy Waffle maker... actually very good results and yummy even if you don't know how to cook. Everything else is your typical continental breakfast: bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices. Breakfast ends at 10am.-- I was surprised to find that you could get room service at this little Inn! Room Service is provided by the neighboring restaurant Firehouse. We didn't get to partake, but the menu looked wonderful. Because it comes from an actual restaurant conveniently next door, the options were plentiful and prices reasonable compared to most big hotel in-house room service.-- You are walking distance from so many restaurants, bars, convenient stores, market, and even a CVS pharmacy. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at Ocean Park Inn. Pacific Beach is a neat little beach community. We got to experience it when the city was hosting a Santa Run marathon and a parade, so the activity was pretty ramped up. But even so, if anyone wanted to have a nice trip to the beach where you can just enjoy yourself at anytime of the year, I would recommend this place for sure.Thank you for taking the time to write a review for Ocean Park Inn.We are so pleased to read that we were able to provide you with an incredible experience. We are very fortunate for our one of a kind location and amazing staff. Your detail review painted a wonderful picture of what travelers can expect from Ocean Park Inn. As I'm sure, many future travelers would find your review to be very helpful. I love that you enjoyed our comfortable bath robes and even purchase some to take home with you. Next time you are looking to make another trip down to San Diego, I am so pleased to hear that you will return to us and would recommend us. We are all looking forward to providing you with another memorable experience.
OPI's actually encouraging people via email to write TripAdvisor evaluations even though they're undergoing renovation of their bathrooms. I'm a little surprised since I can't really rate this stay as high as I have in the past, due to ongoing construction. Anyway, I stayed here 4 nights at their 99 construction rate. Can't beat the rate, though you will have to tolerate workmen pounding away on things all day long, including Saturday and Sunday. However, they didn't start too early in the morning. And there's a fair amount of dust and sharing of the (slow) elevator with construction dudes rolling away carts of material to dump. I had a side room for the first time - not as nice as the ones that look out over the pool to the beach, but it put me farther away from the construction noise so I didn't really mind on this trip. As always, P.B. can be a wild place on the weekends -- good or bad, depending on what you're looking for -- but be prepared.Thank you again for another review! We're happy you've become such a loyal guest of ours - and although this year you had to deal with some extra noise and dust, the goal of our renovation and updates is to give you even more value for your next stay with us. As always, we look forward to seeing you again!
The staff was very friendly and truly made my stay great. Great, family owned business!
This hotel is right on the boardwalk. You couldn't get any closer to the beach. I had a balcony overlooking the ocean and it was so great. Talk about people watching!! The hotel is not a 5-star hotel, but I couldn't be happier with this place. It also has a pool and hot tub and free breakfast in the morning. Parking was very convenient, right under the hotel.Thank you for your wonderful feedback, we are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay! We look forward to welcoming you back again soon!
From the minute we checked in we were very happy with our choice to stay at the Ocean Park Inn. Dexter checked us in and did a great job informing us of everything the area has to offer. The rooms are updated and very clean. The breakfast was also very good. If we ever have the chance to get back to San Diego we will certainly stay here again.
The location is superb. I had a 3rd floor ocean view room which had a terrific view. My disappointment was in the 3 hairs I found, one obvious by the sink and two when i pulled back the sheets. Also, the furnishings are a bit outdated and shoddy. The staff was friendly.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.As you can tell by reading countless other reviews online, cleanliness is one of our biggest fortes here at the Ocean Park Inn. Although this is the first I am hearing about your issue, I can assure you this is not at all common and there are measures in place to prevent issues like this one. On behalf of management and our housekeeping staff, I apologize for this inconvenience.You'll also be happy to know that we are continuously renovating and updating the property. We are currently in year three of our plan, and have already renovated the lobby, breakfast area, and pool area. Additionally, the entire hotel has new carpet and paint, sofas, and our energy efficient GreenStar thermostat system. Later this spring we will continue the process with new bedding and window treatments, in addition to new lighting throughout the property.We do hope you enjoyed the rest of your time in Pacific Beach. Thank you again.
We got very lucky to find this wonderful hotel. The location is perfect, the rooms are spacious and clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, the breakfast is good! The hotel is moderately priced for the location and offers parking, a nice pool, walking distance to excellent restaurants (World Famous, Green Flash), and short walk to beach and walking path. Some people complained about noise from the Firehouse Bar, but treat yourself to an ocean view or partial view and you won't have to worry about noise. As you can tell, I really liked this hotel and hope to visit again someday!Thanks for leaving such a nice review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and all of our amenities , and found our staff members helpful and resourceful. We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for staying at the Ocean Park Inn.
We loved our stay at the Ocean Park Inn. We had an ocean front room, and the beach was a few short steps off the boardwalk that ran behind the Inn. Great views of the beach and the ocean. Many amazing restaurants were within walking distance on the boardwalk. We were a little hesitant about staying here based on some of the reviews, but could not have been happier. The staff was so helpful, giving many recommendations for great places to eat, and things to do while we were staying in San Diego. Pat was especially helpful at check-in and throughout our stay. The carpet was a little worn, but the hotel was very, very clean. The bathrooms have been remolded, and were great. Breakfast had a lot of options, and we never went away hungry. There were folks sleeping on the grounds and around the boardwalk, but not one of them approached us, or bothered us in any way. We felt completely safe out walking, even late at night. There is a bar/restaurant on the front side of the Inn, which was loud at night, but we could not hear any of that noise from our room. There was some noise at night from the boardwalk, (skateboarders, people talking) but the location outweighed any nighttime noise. Definitely request an ocean front room. We moved into the city for the last two days of our stay to be nearer the stadium. We missed the OPI and wished we had not moved to the other hotel (which was a great place, just not the OPI). When we return to San Diego, we will definitely stay at the OPI!Thank you so much for all of your wonderful feedback! We are so glad that you enjoyed breakfast and those wonderful ocean views. We also appreciate your kind recognition of our hard working employees. We are so glad to hear that you will be returning to stay with us, we look forward to welcoming you back!
The location is amazing...on the beach, can walk to dozens of bars and restaurants, and near a bunch of cute shops. The hotel is decent, the common areas seem a little dated and dirty, but they are okay. The room was clean and nice. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The parking fees were some of the cheapest we have seen.
After spending a previous spring break at the Hilton Resort on Mission Bay, we decided to find a place on the ocean. The Ocean Park Inn was the perfect place for our family to stay. Based on reading other's reviews, we requested an upper floor ocean front room. The view from our room was fantastic and we even found enough space on the small balcony to enjoy a cold drink and watch the sunset. The best part is the location. Being right on the boardwalk meant we barely used our rental car the entire trip. We walked north on the beach and explored the tide pools, we walked to lunch, we walked to dinner and were never bored walking south from the hotel.If we are ever in San Diego again, Pacific Beach and the OPI is where we will stay.We're happy to hear you and the family enjoyed spring break with us! You're absolutely right about our location - there is so much to do within walking distance, but at the end of the day it's also nice just to enjoy the breeze and sunset from your balcony! Thanks for uploading some great pics as well - we'll see you next time.
The adults enjoyed early am coffee and breakfast poolside. The teens enjoyed late comp breakfast. Staff knows the local restaurants well and recommends those to match requests. All of us appreciated the bin of borrow ready beach chairs,towels,buckets.Thank you for the feedback Linda! We're glad you and the entire family were able to take advantage of the amenities on the property too. We look forward to seeing you next time.
The location of this hotel is great. The view from our room was wonderful. The staff at this place is great. Patrick was a great resource and helped with directions, recommendations for eateries, and where to find cheap bike rentals. I would definately stay here again. The continental breakfast was more than I expected with waffles, pastries and a fresh assortment of fruit and cereal. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to San Diego that wants a beach front hotel. I would say that the only downfall was the small underground parking spots. It was a tight squeeze even for a compact vehicle. Other than that i would say an exceptional hotel.Glad to hear you had a good time during your stay and enjoyed the amenities.Thank you for giving OPI such an great review.Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn.
I just returned from my 3rd stay at the Ocean Park Inn. After reading some of the negative reviews, I had wondered if maybe a change in staff had resulted in some bad service. Happily, this was not the case. My friend and I were greeted with smiles upon our early check in and every encounter with the staff after that was pleasant and helpful. The location of this hotel can not be beat. The view is perfect and it's within easy walking distance of a million things to do. I think that the bad reviews sprinkled through this hotels listing must be from people expecting an ocean front Ritz Carlton for the price of Motel 6. Stay at this hotel with an open mind and you will NOT be disappointed!
Great location, right on the boardwalk. While not the newest place, Mat, who runs it is very accommodating and nice. Rooms are well sized, comfortable beds, and clean. Underground parking- at a daily charge- is very convenientThank you for the terrific review! We are glad you enjoyed your time with us and we greatly appreciate the kind words about our staff. We hope to see you again soon.
Would we come back to Ocean Park Inn...YOU BET! As in previous years the staff was extremely accomadating...especially David. We loved the fresh bagels, sweet rolls, etc. in the morning. Felt secure having our car in a garage, loved only being steps from the sand. Thanks everyone!
Two reasons I didn't get 5 stars. 1. On the day of check out at 11:02am, the maid was knocking on the door for us to vacate. I understand check out is 11am, but we were packing everything up and we told her we would be out in 5 minutes. 2 minutes later, we received a call from the front desk telling us to vacate. When checking in, our room was not ready and we were told they would text us when the room was ready. We walked down to get something to eat and was never contacted. At 4pm, we walked over to check if the room was ready and it was. They failed to notify us as we were trying to hang out and wait before we could bring our things in and change for the beach. 2. Ice machine not near the room. The ice was near the front desk and there were several homeless people laying on the grass by the entrance from the beach. Four Stars were given because the room was clean, the location was the best to the beach, parking was free, and the free breakfast was just perfect. Although the cost of the room was very very high for a room with no ocean view.
The hotel was perfect! Very laid back, yet professional. Everyone at the desk was friendly and helpful. How many places gladly give you quarters for the vending machines and then say if you have any problem with the machines please let us know. The pool area was immaculate. The beach access is perfect and the beach was clean. Breakfast was good and the setting was pleasant. I thought I left my glasses in the room and the hotel even called me later to let me know whether they found them. Stayed with children and they loved it. Hotel rooms were very quiet. Beds were comfortable and the linens were good quality. Could not hear neighbors. Wi-fi worked perfectly. Parking was very convenient underground. Walking to everything around easy. Loved it.Thank you for the wonderful review and compliments! We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your vacation with us, and we hope to see you again in the future!
We stayed here for a weekend with some family and had a great time. The hotel was lovely, and the rooms were spacious and clean. They provide towels for both the pool and the beach- a nice treat. The hotel is literally steps to the ocean, and there are plenty of bars and restaurants in walking distance. The pool area has very comfortable lounge chairs and plenty of umbrellas to provide a break from the hot California sun. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Highly recommend it!Sarah, thank you for the great review! We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your recent stay-cation with us. We appreciate you taking the time to highlight some of our amenities and the kind words about our staff. Thanks again for the review and we hope to see you back soon.
Stayed here because I attended a seminar at the Catamaran hotel, a 10-15 min walk on the boardwalk. Hotel is right on the beach walking distance to many restaurants. Hotel and room is your typical older hotel in a beach town. Nothing special, but you are paying for proximity to the beach. The boardwalk is safe even in the early morning. Highly recommend CBW restaurant which is a healthy fast food place for salads bowls and wraps. Within a block of the hotel. Note: parking is extra. They have their own underground parking. Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. You may be happy to know this winter we are continuing our renovation efforts, which include but are not limited to: new window treatments, bedding, and furniture in all the rooms. Hopefully the updates will create a more positive impression if you decide to stay with us again. Thanks again!
We stayed four four nights in July on a mini vacation. The room was clean and in good shape however it was a bit dated. I got the feeling that the clientele may have been suspect in the past as there were signs informing you that you'll be charged if this or that is missing form the room. The AC controls require you to put a room key in a slot next to the door which is odd and our room the AC was out on night one. Maintenance quickly fixed this which ended up bypassing this key card interlock so it was a non issue. The wifi in the room was unusable due to low signal. Not sure if it is better by the pool as I never tried but that was disappointing. The location is excellent for beach access although at night it's not exactly family friendly on the street side of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and responsive to our needs. The common areas were very nice and clean. They had beach toys for use and showers with hot water at the entrance form the beach so you can wash off the beach in comfort. The pool and hot tub worked as they should albeit a bit out dated and the poo was in need of repair. No big deal but the water line tile is in need of replacement. That said the pool clean and clear and maintained daily. The hotel supplies towels for the both the pool and the beach which is a really nice feature just make sure the beach towels come back as if they are missing they are 50 each. Overall the hotel was nice, the staff was excellent, and the location very good. Updated rooms with better (read quieter) AC units and useable wifi would garner an excellent review. That said we will look to this property again next year on our annual beat the heat of Phoenix trip to San Diego.Thank you for the review! We're sorry to hear about the WiFi - someone regularly checks the signals, so we'll go back and make sure something wasn't missed. And rest assured, charging guests who take home our nice beach towels or bath robes is standard in the industry - it has nothing to do with the type of clientele here at the hotel!It sounds like you had a very enjoyable vacation here in San Diego. You'll also be happy to know this fall we will continue renovations of our rooms, so when you're ready to escape the scorching desert temperatures next year, check us out again! See you soon!
This was our 2nd time staying at Ocean Park Inn. Again, we stayed in a 2nd floor ocean front room. Great location, right on Pacific Beach. Very comfortable, fabulous ocean and beach views, balcony with small table and chairs overlook the beach. Unlike last visit, this time the wireless internet was completely useless in our room. I mean like non-existent. I had to go to the lobby to use wifi. Pretty inconvenient. They likely need to install few more routers. This reminded me of the state of things 10 years ago,when you'd wander around a hotel with your laptop, trying to find where you could actually get a wifi signal.. Spacious bathroom was renovated since last visit: bathtub removed and replaced with very spacious shower stall. Lots of drawers, decent closet -easy to keep organized. Pool, hot tub and patio area were great: impeccably clean: Staff were often out there picking up towels and tidying up. We swam in the ocean everyday, used the pool and hot tub every day. Very friendly staff. Location is as good as it gets: right on the beach, and walking distance to dozens of restaurants, bike rentals, coffee shops, and beach-and-souvenir shops. A Ralph's supermarket is a 3 minute walk away -great for lunch fixings, fresh fruit or a quick dinner from the deli counter. Free breakfast on site was good:: kids like to make their own waffles, good selection of yogurt, bagels, cream cheese, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, toast, jams and cereals, coffee, juice, milk. Never used the air-conditioner: enjoyed sleeping with sliding doors open, fresh sea breeze and the soothing sound of ocean all night. Not a luxury hotel, but it has everything you need, except useful wifi, is very quite and clean, has friendly staff and location couldn't be better. Teenage kids would like to return a 3rd time, maybe next year.Thank you for all of your positive feedback, we are so glad that we had the opportunity to welcome you back!I have wonderful news, we are currently working on upgrading our Internet. On your next visit to the Ocean Park Inn it will be running much quicker so you will have more time to enjoy relaxing out on your ocean view patio!
If you want to be at the beach this is the place to go! Located near bars and restaurants in a nicer section of Pacific Beach. Good family atmosphere. Quiet area. Continental breakfast is a nice bonus.We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, we love being on the beach as well! We hope to welcome you back again soon.
I have never been to this hotel before and it was so great. The rooms were nice and the beds were very comfortable. We were pleasantly surprised and the staff was A+. Definitely going to go back and enjoy it again.Thank you for such a kind review! I would highly recommend signing up for our newsletter to receive news and specials for your next stay to Pacific Beach. We look forward to seeing you again.
It was our first visit to San Diego and after some extended searches looking for the perfect places to stay, we hit a home run with the Ocean Park Inn. Its located right next to Pacific Beach and walking distance to many places to eat and drink. The staff was welcoming and friendly. Our room was very clean comfortable, with a great view the ocean. Though we made reservations for a partial view, I believe we received a slight upgrade...as our view was wonderful. We were lucky to have Pat and Jasmine working the front desk when we checked-in, they were very accommodating in taking time to provide us an orientation of the area and attractions. We can't wait to make a return trip!!
This hotel was lovely , super clean with amazing rooms. Sea view rooms are to die for. The downside not of this hotel, but the area is that there are so many tramps in the area. Being situated right on the sea front the tramps congregate round the public toilets which are right outside the hotel. They do not hassle anyone though which is ok. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego due to the weather ( as a local told us) , it was a bit of a shock to see so wish I'd been informed b4 we went there , hens I thought I'd put it on here. If you are in this area , please make use of the Bike Ride that you can do around the area , a great way to see the area. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay, your room, and the ocean views! Thank you for taking the time to provide us with this feedback. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego!
the hotel is right in the place to be at PB !board walk, people watching, sunset, beach, pier ! rooms are wide with a recently renewed bathroom Room decor should be renewed.the continental breakfast included in the room rate is convenient even if not particularly reach garage is convenient and not too expensivestaff is kind and helpfulwifi is not always working properly overall a pleasant stayThank you so much for all of your feedback, we are glad that you enjoyed your stay! We are working on some upgrades in our guest rooms throughout the year, we look forward to you experiencing them on your next stay. We appreciate hearing about the internet, we did an upgrade this year for Fiber and it should always be extremely fast, we will look into that and get it fixed. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
If you're looking for a vacation on the beach, I recommend this hotel. Gated underground parking (10/day), friendly front desk staff, 1 minute walk from your room to the beach. Right on the boardwalk, so whether you're looking for ice cream and a hotdog or a sit-down dinner after a day at the beach, it's all within walking distance. Forgot sunscreen, sunglasses, etc There are shops right on the board walk for that. Forgot toiletries, etc There's a CVS right behind the hotel. While the decor wasn't fancy, the hotel was always clean. The bathrooms were updated: walk-in, glass-doored, tiled showers and very large vanities, plenty of room for a family to spread out. Beds were so-so soft but not the most comfortable. If you're willing to pay premium, stay in the ocean-front rooms. We loved sitting on the balcony at night, people-watching and listening to the waves. You can hear the waves from the rooms with the sliding glass doors or windows open, but it's actually very quiet with them closed. We did stay on the north-end of the hotel, so I can't speak for the south-end where there are some restaurants/bars right next door that get loud at night/on weekends.You can also walk pretty much anywhere in Pacific Beach from here shopping, restaurants, etc. I recommend The Mission (in Mission Beach) and Leilani's Cafe for breakfast. Each is about a 15-20 mins walk from the hotel.Overall, happy with our stay, and we would stay again!Thank you for taking the time to provide our prospective guests with some great tips. We are glad to hear you had an enjoyable stay with us at the OPI. Thank you for highlighting our location, as we strongly believe that our location cannot be beat! As you mentioned we are centrally located and anything you could possibly need is within walking distance. We look forward to seeing you again soon.
When I go to San Diego I want to stay on the beach. This is my favorite beach Motel. The people at the desk are very helpful. There is a free continental breakfast. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. Our view of the ocean was great. There is a small pool and a little hot tub also. Parking only 10.00 night. The toiletries are nice. Across the street from Ralphs . Perfect for a few days just to chill at the beach. Many restaurants and bars walking distance. I have been there before and will continue to go there. Pat at the desk is very nice.We are so glad to be your hotel of choice when you come to stay on the beach in San Diego! We look forward to having you back soon!
Stayed at the OPI during Spring Break March '15. This hotel is right on Pacific Beach and is in the heart of all the action. LOts of close by restaurants and drinking available within walking distance. The rooms could use some updating and the hallways definitely need some sprucing up. Our room had a nicely updated bathroom with large walk in shower. The exterior of the hotel is very nice and updated along with a new pool/hot tub area. All new sun loungers around the pool with umbrellas for some shade. They also have a large wicker trunk of beach toys available for kids to take to the beach so no need to buy any.The breakfast items were limited but very handy before heading out for a day full off activity. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. They had great recommendations for restaurants and local activities.Overall a great place to stay while in San Diego.Walter, thank you for taking the time to provide us with a helpful review. We are very pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. furthermore, we are glad that you were able to enjoy some of the great attractions that Pacific Beach has to offer. From excellent local restaurants, to craft beers at nearby bars, to spending the day at the beach, there is something for the whole family to enjoy. Thank you for acknowledging our recently renovated bath rooms and pool furniture, we make a conscious effort to upgrade various parts of the hotel throughout the year and we hope to see you back again soon so you can see some of our newer renovations.
My husband I went for a quick beach getaway. Friendly staff, clean room (although small), beautiful ocean view from balcony easy beach/shopping/restaurant access. Woke up to the sound of the ocean as we kept our balcony door open. We stayed on 2nd floor, it is a bit noisy from the boardwalk traffic down below. It did quiet down as the night went on. Other than that, we had a great stay.
We loved the hotel. We had a large partial ocean view. Our room set back 20 feet from the strand. The whole ocean views are right on the strand which might be a little too close. They offer toys and chairs to take to the beach. Also underground locked parking. In ocean beach it is almost impossible to locate on street parking. The staff are wonderful. The hot tub and pool are just the right temperatures. We also loved the balcony. You can really hear the ocean from there as well as just sitting on your very private balcony. You really don't need to rent a car. Everything is within walking distance. We will definitely stay there again. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience and what the hotel have to offer to the TripAdvisor community. As I'm sure many will find this information very helpful. We are delighted to hear that you will be staying with us again, hopefully sometime soon!
This hotel is located directly on the Promenade on Pacific Beach, which means you just need to step out of your room to be on the beach. We had a room with partial ocean view - strongly recommended! We had the swimming pool below our room, and then the ocean at a (short) distance. The room was pretty large and comfy. Breakfast and Internet access was included. The staff was also very helpful in assisting us with our trip planning. Overall, our stay at this hotel was a highly positive experience!
I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Tim was very, very professional and genuinely helpful!!! He went out of his stay to make us comfortable. I felt relaxed at this hotel. The beds were very comfortable.
Stayed there for 5 days while on a business trip. There isn't a minibar(fridge) like other Hamptons in the area, but was not a bad hotel. Its clean and quite and overall pretty good. Its not within walking distance to anything, but an HEB is not too far away if you have a vehicle.
Always stay at Hilton properties. Although the property itself was nice and well kept, water pressure caused excessive speer time. There is no microwave or fridge. I will stay at another Hilton property on my next visit to the Valley.
Tim, on duty during our check in, was fantastic! Went out of his way to make sure we were totally satisfied. Our flight from SC to McAllen was supposed to have taken a total of 6 hours. Because of problems with American Airlines, it took over 14 hours. We were exhausted by the time we got to McAllen. Couldn't get... More
Pleasant stay in hotel that was quiet and clean. The breakfasts were fine. The staff pleasant and courteous. We found good restaurants close by as well. Though I was at first disappointed in how it looked, I have to say, the end overall impression was very good.
Within walking distance of restaurants and easy access to I-5. This is always a clean hotel with friendly staff. Very comfortable beds with multiple pillow choices. Continental breakfast is the same quality as other hotels--simple and satisfying. The only negative is the pool feels too cold.
I stayed in a horrible hotel ,and found Ramada inn instead...was very nice.Room was large for myself and two daughters,clean,had a microwave and fridge which worked great for us.also included a nice breakfast,which whomever was in charge ,offered kindly to bring us more food! They have a really awesome pool as well! Was a diamond in the rough for us!
They were able to accommodate me at an earlier time than normal check-in. Room was clean and comfortable except for the pillows. Also, there were no bathroom amenities other than shampoo. The town was flooding and under a STATE OF EMERGENCY. The staff was scrambling to accommodate guests as best they could.
Very friendly staff. Room was clean and nicely decorated. Internet was good, but not extremely fast. Easy check in and check out. Breakfast was good and more than typical continental breakfast. Convenient to interstate.
This is my 4th or 5th stay at this location and it has gotten better with time. Recently renovated and much cleaner and newer now than when I first stayed. Unfortunately, they seem to have also increased the price a bit since my first stay and this was unwelcome as the price was important to me in choosing the hotel.We at the Best Western East Inn Suites wanted to thank you for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us. Our staff is proud to know that each time you have stayed with us your experience has only gotten better, and we hope it will continue to do so. We do apologize for the increase in price, but we it was necessary since we have renovated our property. However, we do enjoy having you as a guest, and we do hope to see you again at our establishment soon.
Hard to get in to property. The door handle was broke and the faucet in the bathroom was broken! The lady didn't even offer another room to shower in! Paid lot to have to go out smelling like yesterday Dear 151mistyaI really appreciate you taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize for the plumbing and door lock problems you encountered.We want our guest to have the best stay possible, where everything is in perfect order.

We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns! Please stay with us again soon, so that we can demonstrate our commitment to your comfort.
Good customer service , room clean, quiet , nice are but one thing difrent information on site than what they give you on the phone. Just need to be careful next time. And have a little more smiling workers.Thank you for choosing our property for your most recent stay. I appreciate your feedback and I'm glad that your stay was enjoyable. I do apologize for the misinformation that you might have received and I would really appreciate it if you could provide me with the site that you referenced, that way we can fix any discrepancies. Again thank you for providing us with your feedback and we hope that you choose our property again.
Not as close to UCF as I had hoped. The room was fairly large and had 2 queens which I like. Beds were comfy with good pillows. Bathroom was clean. My only complaint would be the carpet - didn't seem very clean and I kept my shoes on. Bathroom floor was clean though. I don't think it's worth 109/night. Annoying guests who stood outside my room and smoked and talked all night. I didn't have the breakfast so I can't comment on that.I am trying to book a place for an upcoming weekend in the UCF area and I guess I'm gonna go with this place again, although I'd rather find someplace else. It seems that near UCF there are only very expensive choices or total dives. This one is in between so I guess I'll book it. Everything else is filling up fast.
a friend of mine stayed at this hotel with our kids. Brandon helped us with getting our room, he explained the aaa discount to us and was very friendly. He told us of all the services that the hotel provided. On our second stay, we came during a busy time for the hotel. Brandon told us that the there were no nonsmoking rooms available. He upgraded us to a suite, and gave it to us at the same rate as a standard room, and we were able to use the aaa discount as well. Our stay was wonderful, we didn't have any issues. The staff is very friendly, and willing to help with any questions or assistance needed. Its also in a great location, as my friend lives in Titusville its convenient , as she is able to get on the freeway and get to work on time. We now refer to the hotel as our hotel. I am the type of person that I usually would pay more to stay at an embassy suites. I always thought that best western was like a days inn. Brandon and the staff have helped to change my opinion of best western.
This hotel is a step above comparable discount hotels on Colonial drive. The rooms were in good shape, clean and everything was updated and worked well. The free breakfast was above the standard breakfast typically at budget hotels and the pool was clean and in good shape.Thank you for choosing our property for your most recent stay. I would like to thank you on behave of our staff for the positive feedback you've provided us with in your review. We hope that you will choose our property again and that you will enjoy staying with us in the future.
My daughter and I were excited to be in the Orlando area for her college orientation. We enjoyed the staff at Best Western, especially Forest! The rooms were clean, spacious and affordable. The complementary breakfast was a wonderful bonus too. Thank you for taking the time to provide us with feedback and choosing our property for your stay. Forest is a great asset to this company and I will make sure he is rewarded, also notified of this compliment. This is a great location and very convenient to UCF. Hope to see you again soon.
Very kind employees, very clean room, facilities, parking, landscaping. The food was amazing too. I really enjoyed the stay in this best western hotel. Also have a great location. The pool was very crystal clear and have a wonderful temperature.Thank you for providing us with your positive feedback. It's great to hear that our property was perfect for your needs. I'm so glad to hear that our staff was able to enhance your time with us. We hope to see you again soon!
I loved this hotel for many reasons. First of all, it was very clean. The room was spotless! The service was also good except that some of the staff were not very friendly :(. The buffet was a good value. They have cereal in little boxes with milk, the sausages which are great! They also have toast, pancakes, fruit etc. A good starter breakfast! We werent in the hotel except for breakfast and late dinner. For dinner we ordered Dominos pizza often. The rest of the time we spent in disneyworld, better than Disneyland in my opinion! Great rooms and value! Staff not so much.
This hotel was an excellent choice as the location was near Orlando Sanford International Airport just a hop and skip away. The hotel looks nice and is very clean. The staff go over and beyond to help you with anything you need. One of the maids got me hooked up to the internet when their computer was offline, I joked that she should be paid more for being their go-to IT person! Fantastic breakfast!Dear Rhea S.,Thank you for providing us with your positive feedback. We're happy to hear that our property helped to enhance your stay. I am thankful to have a great team to work with and I will make sure to recognize them and their hard work at the next meeting. We hope that you will come again soon.
Our stay was okay, Staff was good, Breakfast was good, Pool was very nice, Rooms were pretty good for the price. Grounds were kept up nice and clean, Great weather. Checkout was very fast. When we had problems they were helpful.Dear Frederick WThank you for the review of my Best Western East Orlando Florida.It is always great to hear how convenient our location is for the many guests who need to be near all the activities whether they be work or pleasure.I am extremely fortunate to have a fantastic team to work with. They are truly what makes this hotel great. I will be sure to recognize them publicly at our next celebration.
10 minutes from UCF. Attentive staff, good prices and decent variety breakfast. Best price I found on that side of town. For some reason, the signage was down but once we found it, the hotel was fine in comparison to others in that category. Seems popular with work crews but no issues. If youre looking for an upscale experience, youll need to pay 40-50 more. Hello and thank you for the positive feedback. We are so pleased that you have joined us and that your experience was a great one. We apologize that the Best Western sign was not visible, unfortunately the last hurricane took it right down. But I am glad that you found us and that we had the pleasure to serve you. Yes a lot of other working crews do stay with us quite often. They have stayed with us a lot thru the years that we feel as if they have become family. We know them all by name and they know all of us by name. We always like to see familiar faces and meet new guests as well. The staff here is always eager to help and we are always finding new ways to make the guests experiences amazing ones. We hope to have your business again soon and take care. Thank you again for the kind words
Staff was very friendly, the breakfast was real good there was a lot to choose from, room was clean, bathroom was clean the only thing that was wrong in my room 227 is , the shower needs more water pressure, it took me twice as long to take a shower due to how slow the water was flowing.but over all I was very satisfied with my stay.Thank you for providing us with your feedback regarding our property. I'd like to start by apologizing for the inconveniences with the shower, I will take your concerns up to our general manager. On the other hand, I'm glad that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and we hope that you will choose to stay with us again.
The room had a disgusting smell, it was overall dirty, bed and pillows were lumpy and the price was too high for this type of room. Even the towels were rough and needed to be replaced. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area. I was very sorry I chose this hotel.
Just stayed one night not a bad room just to get some sleep, Front desk very professorial and Quick check in and out processes. Overall a good experience. Not the flashest room or hotel but for a night its worth that.Happy New Year and thank you for your feedback of your experience here at Best Western. I'm pleased to hear that you had a great experience at check in and check out. We are sorry to hear that the room or the overall property was not up to your expectations. We are always trying to make sure we are up to date with the rooms and that the guest always has what they need in the room. We hope we will still have your business and that we will see you again in the near future
I stayed at the Best Western for one night on business. The floor was dirty. It had not been vacuumed well. There were crumbs on the carpet. There was also what looked like the wing of a cockroach (or some kind of similar insect) on the inside of one of my folded towels. Additionally the phone did not work, so I could not use it to call out or to receive a wake-up call. I would not stay at this motel again or recommend to others.
The staff was really friendly especially during check in and at breakfast. Breakfast was delicious and offered a good variety. My room appeared clean and upgraded. It was also spacious. Location was really convenient. Thank you so much for the positive feedback it really means a lot to us and we are happy to have had your business. We strive to provide the best service to our guests from the first impression they receive from our front desk staff during check-in to the services we provide from Housekeeping, maintenance and attendants that provide breakfast in the morning. We are always trying new ways to improve our services and your feedback let's us know that we are appreciated and our hard work had not gone unnoticed. Thank you again!!
Nice, clean, well maintained property with an exceptionally pleasant and helpful staff. Area is sketchy, and no restaurants nearby, but great value for the money and easy access to 417. Our second stay, and we will recommend and stay there again, I am sure.Dear Lonsgal,Thank you for providing us with your positive feedback. It's great to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our staff was able to enhance that. I do apologize if you felt any type of way in the area, I can assure you it is a safe property but, due to the convenience of being right off of the highway, the few restaurant we have that are really nearby are fast food or a 10-15 minute drive. We do hope that you will stay with us again soon.
Older hotel. Always clean. Staff is always pleasant. Todd at the front desk must have a stash of happy pills. They will eventually loose Brenda at a high pay waitress job, as she can do it. She and Greychen. do a great job with breakfast. Always clean. Always friendly Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. I'm glad that our staff was able to enhance your stay with us and I will make sure that Todd, Brenda, and Gretchen are all aware of your review and are acknowledged at our next meeting. We hope that you will stay will us again soon.
Although the location seems a bit industrial the recent renovations of this hotel combined with the very reasonable rate makes this an excellent value. The rooms are neat and clean. There is a refrigerator in each room and the staff is very friendly. Dear J.G.Thank you very kindly for the review of my Best Western Inn Suites. I am extremely fortunate to have a fantastic team to work with. They are truly what makes this hotel great. I will be sure to recognize them publicly at our next celebration.
We do a fair amount of traveling. Are very interested in clean, comfortable lodgings with a good start to the day with a great breakfast included in the room rate. The need to stay was unexpected, but a delight. No complaints, except for the rain, which they have no control over. Wonderful stay.Thank you for choosing our property for your most recent stay. We appreciate the positive feedback. It's wondeful knowing you found our property to fit your needs and most important you left here satisfied. Please come again.
The hotel itself might be old, but the good thing is they provide everything needed.I assume the major upgrade they went through was the TV in the room as compared with other stuff such as furnitures the only thing that looks new is the TV.Given the rate that I paid, it is a spacious room that is bigger than I thought.
We walked in on a Friday night to book a room after selling our home in Orlando and needing a place to stay for one night before moving on to our new city state. Sharlene treated us like royalty! After learning of why we were staying she offered to upgrade our room with the understanding it wouldn't be ready for a couple more hours - no worries since we were going to celebrate with friends at a local restaurant. Upon our return several hours later Todd was there to assist as well and checked us in quickly with a big smile and great sense of humor. Sharlene appeared and provided gift bags with water a snack which was an additionally sweet gesture. The room was clean and adequate space for our stay and the continental breakfast was amazing! Many choices and all was very fresh accompanied by another great member of the staff to ensure we had everything we needed! They all made an emotional time much better with their friendly smiles, positive attitudes and great sense of humors. We would stay there again when in town to visit friends in that area and recommend to others for sure - great job!!!Dear Tricia M.,Thank you for providing us with your feedback of our property. It's great to hear that your time with us was great and that our staff was able to help make your stay a better one. I will make sure that both Sharlene and Todd are aware of your review and that they are recognized at our next meeting. Also, I'm glad that our property ended up being perfect for your stay. We hope to see you again soon. Thanks!
My husband and I called the Best Western 800 number to inquire about this Property. We especially wanted a hotel with restaurant, bar, pool and central conveniences and shopping. Expecting we wouldn't have to leave here for anything as we have been driving for hours. we were informed that all of the above are at this BW site After arrival... finding that there was a pool but NONE of the other amenities. this hotel is in the middle of nowhere. We also booked weeks ahead for early checkin. still didn't get checked in until almost 4pm. Other folks arrived after us and were checked in before us. Another couple we spoke with at the pool were mislead as well. The floor/carpet by the bed was soaking wet and smelled of musty/moldy..so we called for several towels to absorb the water. The manager gave us a bag of candy, pretzels and two pops for our trouble. I don't want to put down the hotel because it is quite nice ..we were upset about the MISLEADING information. because NOW we have 3 more days booked here in March that we cant get out of because we booked it through airmiles.Dear LBradshaw2014Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. I did call the Best Western 800 reservation number to see why someone would say we have a restaurant and bar when we do not. We hope you will come back and see us again soon. And I do apologies on behalf of the Best Western 800 reservation office.
As with other reviews, in spite of the freeway noise the hotel is above par, on the older side but extremely well maintained. A small but clean pool... a fitness room would be a plus. The neon sign claims that the staff are friendly - that is true - it also states that the hotel provides a continental breakfast. For some hotels that would be a few muffins, cold cereal and packet of bagels.... not so here. Cheese omelettes, bacon and hash browns as well as biscuits and gravy, lots of fruit and greek yogurt, and of course the obligatory muffins and bagels. This, in my estimation is not a continental breakfast but a great well balanced meal with lots of options. Would we stay there again... in a heart beat!!! Thank you for being a part of our weekend getaway. Location very central for out Annie Russell theater trip, dinner in Winter Park, Global Energy 10K at Festival park and Cirque du Soleil at the Amway.Thank you for providing us with your review of our property. I'd like to start by thanking you on behave of our staff and I'm glad that we were able to help enhance your time with us. Instead of having a fitness room, we did just put into action a new Fitness-in-a-bag system. We do not have the fitness room, but we offer this instead, so that guest may still be able to exercise in the comfort of their rooms with some of the fitness gear provided in the bag. We hope that you do choose to stay with us again soon.
My husband and I enjoyed staying at your hotel except for one thing: bed sheets and linen. I noticed that the linen were not replaced with new sheets. At first I tried to ignore it but then when I was getting ready to sleep that was when I felt something itchy on my left leg and when I checked it, I noticed some red small dots on my skin. It started to itch the moment I sat on the bed. And also, I watched your housekeeping staff how she cleaned the room: she did not vacuum the floor, did not change the bed sheets and not really properly cleaned the whole room.Thank you for providing us with feedback regarding your most recent stay at our property. I would like to start by apologizing for the inconveniences you faced during your time with us. As far as the sheets being changed in the room, the sheets are only changed every 3 days unless there is a different guest being checked in or if it is requested. After a guest is to check out housekeeping does inspect every room for bbs, so I do apologize if there was any concern for them. I wish that I had been notified of this before you checked out that way we could have further investigated whether it was something like bbs or if it could have been our fabric softener. I hope that you will give us another opportunity to change your opinion on our property.
Stayed here for a few nights while visiting different sites in Orlando.Staff was friendly. Room was spacious. Bed a little uncomfortable but not enough to complain about. Breakfast was good. Would recommend.Thank you for providing us with your feedback. I'd like to apologize for any of inconveniences you may have experienced as far as with the bed. On the other hand, I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay and that our staff was able to enhance that in any way. We hope that this doesn't deter you from staying at our property again.
This room was not clean. There was some red, bloody looking prints on the bathroom door. Also, the dressing and bathroom area was very un-suitable! The bathroom had a sink with no counter around it. So, all my stuff had to be some place other than where I needed them (like my contact lense items, make-up, etc. Then, when you got into the actual bathroom, there was no surface to place anything on, or any hooks to hold your towel. The room was for a handicapped person, but, even a handicapped person needs a surface to hold their towel and clothes. Even the toilet did not have a lid. So, you went in there and where was your towel and clothes to be This room was a disaster. Then, we stayed there on New Years Eve and left on New years day. We left at around 10 am. There was no breakfast. When I asked, they said that breakfast ended at 9:30 am because it was a weekday. I told them it was a National Holiday and they said that they do not celebrate or acknowledge the National Holiday of New Years day. So that was that! We were not pleased!! And will never stay there!!
This was one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at, we travel a lot and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I have reviewed a lot of hotels and I rarely leave a bad review, but this was too disgusting to not address.We were moving my cousin to Orlando, and needed a late night hotel last minute. We picked the best western, in hind sight I wish we had slept in the car. We checked in around 1 am. Once we got settled in and ready for bed, we started seeing small roaches crawling out from behind the painting above our bed. My husband killed the 2 that we saw. We were a little grossed out but that late at night, we didn't have many options. The next morning we woke up to more roaches crawling around the painting. Then we saw a couple of huge ones above the TV. After seeing this we wondered how many more were in the room. We grabbed our stuff went to front desk and told them. She refunded us 50 . My husband emailed the manager STUART BLOOMBERG about this. He emailed us back and told us the exterminators came and said the room was perfectly clean and there wasn't a single roach. So either we saw the only 4 roaches in the room or someone is not being honest. My husband relayed to Stuart how grossed out we were and asked for the remainder of balance to be refunded. Stuart told us he can't do that the roaches must have entered the room when we opened the door to enter the room ourselves. At this point not only were we disgusted by the pest infested room but also insulted by the manager that he would accuse us of letting the roaches in. We are realistic, a bug here and there is normal, but a roach infested room is a sign of filth. We are so disappointed, what a waste of money, and such poor customer service. STAURT BLOOMBERG offered us 50 off on our next stay, as if we would EVER go back to that hotel. I have never left a hotel feeling this disgusted. A word of advice to the manager of this hotel, don't blame your customers for your hotels lack of hygiene. Unprofessional staff, filthy hotel, stay somewhere else.Dear Deepti DI really appreciate you taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize again as did my staff did for the failure in our extermination program. My staff did reduce your stay to 50 off before you checked out.A pest free environment is basic for a good stay. I am sorry if that was not the case during your stay. You can be confident that we did follow-up on your concerns, so that others are not disappointed as you were.Again, thank you for making the effort to share your thoughts. We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns! Please stay with us again soon, so that we can demonstrate our commitment to your comfort.
My stay Here was exactly what I expected for the price . Me and my wife had a weekend gateaway and it was perfect ! Joel Baez the Chief engineer was very helpful with my luggage , he also recommended a few restaurants in the area . I will totally recommend it for an affordable, well kept room.
Second year I have stayed at this hotel. I have business in the area and it is convenient for me. Morning free breakfast is very good, hot, fresh and a large selection. Typical motel setting with free parking. Bed was very comfortable. I wasn't happy with the cleanliness this visit. My white socks were pretty dirty after walking around in the room. On check out I told them of 2 issues I felt needed to be resolved. They made a note of that. 2nd day, I returned to my room at 10 p.m. and housekeeping didn't freshen my room. Upon checkout I told the Front Desk, and they said, If you have a Do Not Disturb sign on your door at 9 a.m., they by-pass your room and don't come back. When I told them I removed the sign at 10:15 a.m. when I went to work for the day, Front Desk basically said, that's their policy. I find that policy totally inconsiderate. Next time in the area, I will seek another hotel.Thank you for providing us with your feedback and choosing to return to our property. I do apologize for the inconvenience you experience during your time with us. I do recall you mentioning at checkout that you had a DND sign on the door and removing it sometime after 10:15 am and I explained that housekeeping will not service room with DND sign but housekeeping do return later in the day and service rooms that have removed DND sign. I wish you would have brought to my attention about the carpet being dirty so I could have given you an upgraded room or offered some type of compensation. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.
We spent 2 nights and were satisfied with the overall experience. The rates are excellent compared to other hotels in the area and the location very convenient for our purposes. Though the weather was a bit cold when we stayed, it would have been nice to visit the hot tub, but it was out of service.
Exelent hotel with a good location for vacations or business withh a good price and service. The rooms are very confortable. Near to the main strrets to go to the atractacions, universities and business.Thank you for taking the time to respond to our survey and choosing ths property for your most recent stay. I am so very pleased that you found the service excellent and the rooms to be in good condition. This is a very convenient location and I'm happy this was the right place to accommodate you, please come back and see us again soon.
Older hotel but very clean. comfortable beds, breakfast was great. our room was very clean. pretty convenient to restaurants and UCF. Hotel was under a little renovations (painting and taring of the parking lot) but this did not interfere at all.Thank you for providing us with your feedback. I will start by apologizing for any inconveniences you may have experienced during your time with us, but we are recently undergoing some updates and renovations to the hotel. On the other hand, I am glad that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and we hope that you will choose us again in the future.
I have stayed here 4x over the 1 1/2 years. I stay here for the convenient location to my destination. Not sure if it is under new management or not, but I have certainly noticed some improvements to the rooms and the friendliness of the staff. The breakfast is always good and the pool is kept clean. Now, if they can just add some weather strip around the doors to the rooms...too much heat and light come in.Thank you for providing us with your feedback of our property. I'd like to start by apologizing for any of the inconveniences you may have experienced during your stay. I'm glad that you can see the changes were making to our property and I will make sure to pass your concern about the weather strips onto our general manager. We hope that you choose to stay with us again and we continue to improve. Thank you.
Hotel's rooms are very spacious. The staff was super friendly. good location. The only thing that was a light bit negative is that I had a suite becuase I knew I would need the pull out couch. There were no blankets or pillows left for the pull out bed. It was clean and had sheets. The suite was very spacious and affordable.Thank you fro providing us with your feedback of our property. I'd like to start by apologizing for any of the inconveniences that you may have experienced during your stay as far as the sheets for the pull-out. I do hope that the front desk was able to give you the extra sheets upon request. I am however glad that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and we hope that you will choose to stay with us again given the opportunity.
Great hotel for good price!hotel was clean.everyone was very friendly (huge plus!)breakfast was delicious .. so many choices... sausage gravy and biscuits, waffles, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, egg omletes, sausage patties.great location... 5 miles from UCF, right off hwy but very quiet hotel.this will definately be our hotel of choice for the next 4 years while our son attends UCF!Dear Shannon LThank you for staying at my Best Western Inn Suites here in Orlando. This is a great place to stay for any reason.Your comment on how we are a good match for families is certainly spot on. Our breakfast allows everyone in the family to choose what they like to eat and its included within your rate complimentary. I sincerely hope you can return on vacation soon and trust your business in Orlando went well
The room was clean, only good bit. The location was good. Staff were, Staff!! The corridors were old and need of an update, dirty and smelly. There were ice and coke machines that did not work. the Air con was noisy, we were travelling around so were not here too long thank goodness. It was in general old and needed an overhaul
The Best Western Orlando East was a pleasant surprise. I looked for economy but found a comfortable, clean home away from home for a business trip. The staff were friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet featured scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, biscuits with gravy, Belgium Waffles and more. Pleasant touches like a well made bed and artistically folded towels made the business trip more relaxing.
the hotel itself was ok, but from my past stay I can say its improved. dena was very helpful in every way she a great asset to your company. she made my stay very enjoyable. Mirlanda as well, very sweet young lady!! I would definatly come back especially if their workingFirst, I want to thank you for choosing the Best Westrn East Inn Suites for your recent stay. I am very fortunate to have a great team to work with. They are truly what makes this hotel great. I will be sure to recognize Mirlanda at our next greet. Hope to see you again.
Really one of the nicer inns around. Nice interior design, friendly staff, good breakfast.Affordable for families - we are a family of four, and as opposed to many hotels, there is actually enough space for us and the luggage :).Special kudos to Gina who helped us get the day started.
This place was great. The room was clean and tidy. The bed/pillows were comfortable. The breakfast was one of the better I have had, the inclusion of croissants and french toast sticks made it better than most hotels I've stayed in. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is a good sized refrigerator in the room and the pool looked nice (too bad it was raining.) The location is close to a wide variety of restaurants and the UCF campus. The only drawbacks I found was that the WiFi could be improved and the room could use a microwave, there is a microwave in the lobby but I prefer the convenience of one in the room.,Thank you for leaving your feedback regarding your most recent stay with us. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay at our property. It's great to hear that you enjoyed your room as well as breakfast. We are currently looking into the concerns you brought up in this review, thank you for bringing them to my attention. We hope that we will have the pleasure of seeing you again in the future.
I stayed at this hotel last year and am glad to say everything was just as good. Nice king suite by the pool, very clean and comfortable. Free WiFi and usual good BW breakfast, eggs, bacon, waffles, cereal, Danish and other goodies. Can highly recommend this hotel.Dear Shatzymaus,Thank you for providing us with positive feedback regarding your most recent stay with us. It's great to hear that you are a returning guest and we hope that you continue being one. Hope to see you again soon!
Great hotel very clean on a busy street nice pool area very clean rooms and convinient to all areas of Orlando. Staff was very friendly. The breakfast was mediocre and was nothing to be excited about but the rest was amazingThank you for providing us with your feedback regarding your stay. It's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and that our property was perfect for your stay. I'm glad that our staff was also able to enhance your time with us. We hope to see you again soon.
This is a no-frills hotel, but perfectly met our needs for our recent long-weekend. We went between UCF (15min away) and Disney (35min away) so it functioned as a perfect location. There were tons of restaurants, gas stations, and fast food places along the same road. A Walmart Neighborhood Market (grocery store for those of you who don't know) was about 10min down the road, too. The front desk staff was pleasant and check-in was easy. The 25 deposit was credited to my account immediately after checkout, too. Our room was clean and up-to-date. The towels were nice. Water pressure in the shower was also great. The mini fridge was really cold and the microwave was functional. My kids did take time to enjoy the pool, and they really liked it. It was clean and just the right temperature. Overall it was a great stay. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you for providing us with feedback regarding your most recent stay with us. It's great to hear that our property was perfect for your stay and I'm glad that you would consider staying with us again. We hope to see you soon.
Good for a quick overnight stay. The ac wasn't regulating properly but the temperature was fine. The staff was friendly. The room was decent and clean. It's further out from the attractions. So travel time may take a bit longer to get to the attractions.
Close to where we needed to be good breakfast, staff was great price was ok internet a little jumpy and had to ask for wash cloths bath fan stopped working but otherwise good stay would stay again.Lots of places to eat close.Thank you so much for your positive feed back we appreciate it very much. We do apologize about any inconveniences during your stay and we will work on any matter that needs service as soon as we can be of service. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and was able to eat at near by places that suited your convenience. I'm pleased to hear that your breakfast was enjoyable and that staff gave you a great feeling. We always strive to give the best customer service to our guests and I'm glad you felt your stay was great. Thank you for your business and we hope to see you and serve you again soon.
Traveled to Orlando for a science competition at University of Central Florida. TERRIBLE front desk service, unfriendly breakfast staff. Able to clearly hear street noise, not able to access high-speed internet despite room being close to lobby. Budget-friendly, but wished I had not agreed to staying at this property when proposed by the AAA travel agent.
My stay was uneventful and quiet which is exactly what is needed for business travel. A light outside my room was flickering badly but was repaired the same evening upon calling the front desk. Breakfast and to go snacks were also convenient.Thank you very much for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us at the Best Western East Inn Suites. We wanted to thank you for staying with during your business trip, and we do apologize for the flickering light. However, we are glad to know that our front desk staff and maintenance were able to take care of the issue quickly. We are glad that you enjoyed your stay, and we do to see you again soon!

This hotel was a blessing to our family. The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable and the breakfast amazing. The staff was kind, and helpful. We would definitely stay here again and my 20 year old didn't want to leave .. he came up talking about how wonderful the breakfast staff was, particularly Amy.. if a 20 year old mentions it .. you know you need to stay at this hotel!Thank you for providing us with your feedback! It's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and that our property was perfect for your needs. We're glad that you and your 2o year old loved the breakfast and I will make sure that Amy is aware of your review and recognized at our next meeting. We can't wait to see you again!
I am currently a resident of Louisiana, and I am enrolled in graduate school at Asbury Theological Seminary in Orlando, Florida / Wilmore, Kentucky (2 campuses). I have been coming to Orlando about 4 - 6 times a year for on-campus classes, and I have always stayed at this particular Best Western on East Colonial Drive. This hotel has been perfect for my commute and the accommodations are exactly what I need. The staff are not only friendly but very helpful, and this has been consistent for the last year or two that I have been coming. With this particular visit, the hotel had recently upgraded their internet services but since my computer is aging I was having trouble getting it to work properly. One of the maintenance techs Joel Baez helped me troubleshoot it for a good 30 minutes before we threw in the towel on the wireless and he provided me with an ethernet cable. Problem solved and I'm back online! Thanks Joel B.! Thanks Best Western for always being there when I needed you to be!Sincerely,Stephen HebertThank you very much for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us at the Best Western East Inn Suites! We are ecstatic to know that you have been staying with us for some time, and each time your stay was met to your satisfaction. We are sorry if you had trouble with the internet, but it was great That Joel was able to stop by to help you with the issue. We are always working hard to maintain satisfaction for our guests, and we will be sure to acknowledge Joel at our next meeting for assisting you to maintain your satisfaction with your stay. We always enjoy having you as a guest, and we do hope to see you again at our establishment soon.
I stopped in on business, my flight was delayed by several hours and decided to call it a night. From the moment I made a call and asked if they had any rooms available I was treated warmly and with kindness. The rooms were clean, it was surprisingly quiet. The beds were comfortable and I was able to get a good nights sleep and a hearty breakfast before my flight back. I dealt with William and Joel upon my exit and both cared enough to make sure I was rested and well treated! I travel a lot with my company and will DEFINITELY make sure I am booked here every trip to Orlando! GREAT JOB STAFF!
It may look decent outside, but the rooms are not that great. The bathroom and room smells bad. Had to buy an air freshner because it was so bad. The water smells bad too. Queen size bed and one sofa, and there's a wall barrier between bed and sofa (odd). The breakfast bar was not good. There's a pool, it's okay. And the jacuzzi was out of service. Ice machine out of service.It is unfortunate that you and your family encountered many issues that made your stay less then satisfactory. All of your concerns have been addressed with my staff with the exception of our spa. Unfortunately there is never a good time to remodel, however our spa is in the process of being resurfaced. It is not the norm of our hotel to fall short on so many areas. I apologize on behalf of myself and my staff and will make sure our future guests do not experience the same areas of concern as you did.Sincerely,Best Western Management
Short Staffed - Was the only one in the lobby, waited 15 minutes for the only staff member who was on the phone trying to find a reservation in the system to cancel it for someone who just made it. The caller should have been referred to the online or national call in reservation system. The hotel was sold out - perhaps Management should have thought to have more than one person on staff until midnight perhaps Dirty Bed Linens - Once in my room, was disgusted to find that one of the beds obviously had not been changed with new sheets. - Luckily it was a double queen room and the other appeared clean. The green bed covers were filthy and torn. Will not be staying at a Best Western again. Told the agent at the front desk who apologized and removed a nominal amount off the check. Travelling on business - so that really doesn't make much of a difference to me.Noisy Air Conditioning - When the under-the-window air handler came on, it sounded like an Chevy Suburban on at fast idle.Thank you for responding and providing feedback regarding your experience during your stay. I do apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused during you visit. I can assure you that we are fully staffed and two agents were scheduled for that night. Second agent left at 8:30 p.m. once things had slowed down. Unfortunately, we did receive a rush around 9:00 pm that night. I do appreciate you being patient. during that rush hour and again I apologize and hope that you will consider giving us another chance to make your stay better.
Very clean, simple place. I have never stayed at a motel / hotel as nice accepting large dogs . Room was very clean and staff very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise. What a value and pleasant stay.Thank you for taking time to provide us with positive feedback you experience during your stay. I'm happy to know we exceeded you expectations. We hope to see you again soon.
My husband and I stayed here while we looked for apartments and toured Full Sail University. Everyone was really helpful and super nice. Todd and Mrs Dena had us laughing the whole trip, we could have spent the trip just laughing with them. Brandon was great and really made us feel welcome and happy. The breakfast was alright, nothing spectacular but something for everyone. The only thing bad I can say is that it seems like maintenance sometimes forgets that guests can hear them on the radio, just a little a sassy but not rude at all. All in all our trip proved one thing, wish we could move in to the best western. Also a really big thing for my husband and I, no one batted am eye lash about two men sharing a king size bed. Love this place would come back and will tell all our family and friends to stay here. I appreciate you taking the time to reply to this survey. I apologize that breakfast was not to your liking, however, we have improved our breakfast menu. We now offer bacon, sausage, egg omelet, scrambled eggs and much more. It's nice to know we were able to make you smile and that your stay was enjoyable. Hope to see again soon.
Todd the front desk was very professional. Rebecca spoiled the clients like a mother hen. These two employees are really asset to that place where they work. I will definitely, recommend that Best Western Orlando East inn suites. Overall everyone was very nice. The only thing that was lacked over there was an excercise room.We at Best Western wanted to extend our thanks for providing feedback regarding your recent stay! We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and that Rebecca and Todd were able to enhance your stay with us. We will be sure to commemorate these two great employees for going above and beyond for you. We do apologize for not having an exercise room, but that is something we are trying implement either into our location, or with local gyms. However, we do greatly value you as a guest, and hope to continue to keep Best Western in mind the next time you need a place to stay.
Roach in the room but the staff said its just a bug not a roach, like that made it any better. Big hole in the bathroom wall were this bug/roach came out of. Wonder what other rodent will come out of the wall.Thank you for providing us with your feedback. I would like to apologize for any of the inconveniences you may have experienced during your time with us. I wish that I had been notified of your concerns before you had checked out and I would like to apologize on behalf of our staff.
The staff here is amazing! We arrived at the hotel super early and they were able to accommodate our room needs! The free breakfast was a huge plus, but the employee Brenda topped our visit off! She was very friendly, helpful and kind! She became our friend over the week. The beds are comfy and the rooms were very clean. Next time we're in Orlando we will definitely stay here. Thanks Brenda Todd!!!-Damisha EdwardsDear Damishaae,Thank you for leaving us your positive feedback regarding your stay at our property. It's great to hear that our hotel was able to be perfect for your needs and that we were able to accommodate your stay. Todd and Brenda are a great part of our team and I will make sure that they are aware of your review and are recognized at our next meeting. We hope to see you again soon.
Went with family, my parents and my children, was child friendly. Pool area very nice, needs more shady areas. Close to our destination, which was UCF, for Odyssey of the mind state competition. Would go there again next year!Dear Nicole H I thank you genuinely for the kind words and for staying at my Best Western Inn Suites here in Orlando recently. We look forward to seeing you again next year for the Florida Odyssey
This motel has come a long way in the last year. With new management it has been updated extensively. A few more things need to be done, but the pool area is now great - new matresses - new air conditioning units - new lamps-- just a real step in the right direction!Dear Robert PI thank you genuinely for the kind words and for staying at my Best Western Inn Suites.We are continuing updating our product with new ice machines coming, finishing up the 2nd floor with a new light package, mattress, new coffee makers, refurshing our room furniture, future coming new carpet, new sofa beds, renovating the lobby. etc.
I checked in late by reception was quick and efficient. I requested a room I could park in front of, and got one.The room was fine. An old style A/C unit on the outside wall worked great and wasn't too loud.TV was 32 Flat Screen with a good selection of free channels.Downside...Bathroom was extremely small. A tiny sink and counter in the bedroom, and the tiniest bath/shower/toilet I can ever remember experiencing. No non-slip mat or strips were provided. It was very clean, however.Breakfast was a tad under standard for a BW...No hot items, unless you consider Eggo style waffles...
Friday morning we were awoken by landscapers at 7:00 am. Now we are on vacation it would have been nice if they started a little later. Also, our second night our room was not made up or clean towels when we arrived back at 11pm. When we asked why at the front desk we were told because we had the Do not disturb sign on our door still at 10am. However someone was in our room because our air conditioner was shut off. The front desk staff both at night and the next morning basically did not care because we booked through Expedia and not them. The staff for the continental breakfast were so sweet polite and helpful. I enjoyed seeing them every morning.Our last night all we heard all night was a dog barking. Again the staff said Well people sneak dogs in. And then pretty much shrugged there shoulder in a not caring action.I will definitely not stay here again when I visit my daughter at school.
Hotel is nice and clean staff is very friendly rooms are very clean and big. Micro and ref. In room .we came here on business and parking is OK. Not really a lot of food near here. But what matters to us is friendly staff and size of the room . The breakfast is really nice also great coffee there was eggs and sausage, they had sausage graveyard and biscuits . The sink was didn't work great and Joel maintained guy came right in and fix it give him a 10 .We at the Best Western East Inn Suites wanted to thank you for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We first wanted to apologize for our lack of eatery, but with our shortcomings we try to make sure we excel with service and cleanliness. We are proud to know that you were satisfied with our staff, room, and the breakfast. We enjoyed having you as a guest, and we do hope that we will see you again soon!
Room was not cleaned one of the days I stayed there. Breakfast was average. Ice machine not great. Parking was good. Internet was fast, but had to log password every 24hrs. Overall is was an average stay.
Hotel was clean. Check in was painless. Breakfast had a good variety and tasty. Had a huge block of rooms for a sporting event and grateful that hotel opened breakfast early to accommodate the athletes and their schedules.Thank you for your positive feedback regarding your most recent stay at our property. I'm glad that you enjoyed your time with us. It's great that you enjoyed our breakfast too, I'll make sure the breakfast employees are aware of your review. We hope to see you again soon.
Hotel could use some renovation, but it was convenient for my purpose. The staff was friendly and the room was as clean as you would expect a hotel room to be. 2 major needs: the toilet seats need to be upgraded to larger size and the hot water needs to be regulated better. I had to take my showers in phases as I waited for scalding water to subside every 30 seconds or so.

This was our 2nd stay at PACIFIC SHORES INN. Last January we visited and booked again this year because we were so delighted with the property. Travelling with two small dogs can be difficult and staying here made it quite easy. There is a reasonable fee of course, but everyone was kind and open to their presence. We had 3 adults staying in a ground floor room with two queen beds. There was plenty of room, the room was clean, there was a frig, coffee maker and micro wave. Great place to travel with young children. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful, housekeeping staff was cheerful and available to help with extra towels, etc. What more could you want from a beach front hotel with the most beautiful winter sunsets off the San Diego coast We wil be back soon!!First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to write this review. I am also glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and of course, your pets are always welcome here. We are one of the few properties that do accept pets and we know many by their names. You also mentioned the sunsets, where everyday is a unique experience!!!! That never gets old, and is one of the perks of managing this property!!
We stayed over fall break to take advantage of San Diego's pay for an adult/ child in free. They had remodeled the rooms since we were last there. The bathroom was very nice and so was the bedroom. It came with a mini fridge and microwave plus table to allow us to eat breakfast daily in our room. I hope that they will eventually have a breakfast for their guests because that would make it a perfect location with it walking distance to the beach. We are very pleased that you came back to stay with us. I hope you will come back again soon!
Okish hotel. Some things have been updated but the interiors could do with a revamp. Shower painfully slow even after prompt attention from the maintenance man. Brilliant place for surfers I would imagine.
We had originally booked at the PB Surf Beachside Inn, but the afternoon prior to our arrival I received a call from the front desk informing me we were being moved to the sister property a block away. I was not thrilled with the change as I had spent many hours pondering, looking at pictures, maps, and reviews on the internet before making the selection. When we arrived and saw the room, it was nice enough, but you could tell it was only halfway remodeled. There we obvious upgrades, nice BIG new TV, nice little fridge and microwave, however the old curtains were still up, and the floor was carpeted, not tiled. The bathroom was upgraded, but also unfinished, as the shower grout and chalking was not finished around the bottom....which allowed water flow out the shower, under the wall and into the carpet in the room. We discovered this as our socks got soaked as we walked into the bathroom across the soggy carpet.Front desk was very helpful. When we turned our TV on, there was no cable. When we called the front desk, she cheerfully came down and immediately found the problem, the cable was not plugged into the TV. She also told us to let management know about the leaky shower when we checked out...which we did, and they got us a reasonable discount.The location is superb! It's a couple minutes walk to the beach, and there is a nice grassy park above the beach on the little bluff with great views. Many reasonably priced restaurants in walking distance.We will be back, and hope to get a fully finished room...at which point the review will be 4 or 5 instead of 3!Of course, we would love to receive a 5! But, I do understand your issues, and I believe I met you while I was picking up some paperwork at the desk. Please just give me a call the next time, and we'll make sure you get a fully renovated room! Thank you! And, btw, we did take care of the issues you told us about! Thank you.
We travelled fron San Francisco to San Diego at similarly priced hotels and this is my first average review. The beach is beautiful and the location of the hotel is just one short block from the beach. You are charged for Wifi, the breakfast is pastry and coffee tea with creamora, the rooms are dated, and the air- conditioning is noisy. We just used the fan since the nights were cool to drown out the noise. I have stayed at other dated hotels with no air-conditioning, maybe I expected more. They did have complimentary parking and the bathrooms were clean. There was also a pool but when you have an ocean steps away, why botherYes, I guess a few of our rooms are dated, but they will all be new by this time next year, and we have already renovated about half. Each room is different when it comes to a/c noises, and we try to keep up with repairs for the big compressors we have located in our back alley. I hope you will try us again the next time you are here in San Diego. Also, our rates are very competitive in the off-season. Thank you!
The location of this place is what makes it worth the stay. It's close to the beach and lots of restaurants within walking distance. Mission street is a block away. The rooms were decent but the bathrooms were rundown. The worst part was a weird smell that came from the rug. It made the whole place feel dirty. Also, you have to pay for wifi. It's worth the stay if you are not planning on spending too much in your room.Thank you for your comments. We are planning to renovate the remainder of our rooms very soon, thus eliminating the old carpets that could no longer be serviced. We hope to see you again soon.
Hotel is good for a very short stay. I had a partial view of the beach which was good. I was 1/2 block from the beach. I was 1 block from the main st Mission ave and several blocks from the main drag where all the shops and restaurants are. Found a cute coffee shop as I needed a real meal with fruit which was not available at the hotel. This cute shop in a house is called Cafe 976 and has Gluten free items. It is on 976 Felspar st. Cross mission 1 block to Felspar and then turn right, then walk about 5 blocks. You can't miss it. I wish my room had a table. It had a huge lounge chair too big. There was also some water leakage from the shower which had damage the lower door area. I thought i saw traces of mold but I tried not to think about that. I made a note of it when I checked out. The bed was very comfortable. The TV worked ad the workers pleasant and helpful. They might add fruit to their breakfast bar, after all its Califormia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pacific Shores has the nearby beach going for it. That said, if you want to be more centrally located to the main San Diego area you may be disappointed here. It is just off of Pacifc Beach which is directly North of Mission beach. They are both just North of Mission Bay and Sea World. That means they are also well North of the San Diego harvour area, the downtown and Blaboa Park. We found the drive to Sea World to be easy with routes to Mission Bay right down Mission Boulvard or over Grand Street to Ingrahm Ave. We tried the beach both off of the motel at pacific beach and down near Belmont Park on Mission beach. The Mission beach area is a little better for kids. Both are well patroled by lifeguards and the ocean surf is warm and fun to play in. We spent three nights at Pacific Shores. The motel is going through some growing pains with upgrading going on. One afternoon after returnign from the beach we were kept oput of returnign to our room while maintenance was replacing a light switch with sensor switch. This was late in the afternoon at a time when they should expect the guests may want to return to thier rooms. The timing was bad. The last night we spent the smoke alarm batery gave out around midnight and the device began emitting loud alarms. A call to thew dsk brought someont tot eh room aroun 1:00AM, We had to small boys with us trying to sleep. The man replaced the bsattery in the smoke dector and wehn away. A hald horu later it began letting off a short blast every hour or so for the rest of the night! We has a restless night and the kids were not happy. Complaining to the manager lead to the expalnation that the battery was probably not put in properly, sorry about that. No adjustment was offered on our rate but he did say if we come back again to call him and he would give us a better rate next time. Overall while the location may be out of the way to some we enjoyed the proximity of the beaches, the overall casual atmosphere of the area. The motel manager also mentioned that upgrades are planned to replace the pool area and improve the overall motel. The cost is reasonable, the weather is always great and if that darn smoke alarm goes off put the battery in yourself!
I had booked at this hotel for 2 nights. I arrived to check in and was told that there was no reservation in my name (even though I had the confirmation number showing the reservation) and that the hotel was fully booked . The clerk tried blaming it on the booking company and then told me I should have booked through the hotel directly and that it was my fault for using a booking company. However I'm prerty sure the hotel jusy over booked on purpose. She didn't offer me any help at all so my 3 kids and I were stranded in an unfamiliar town with no where to go and a dying cell phone. She didn't offer any apology nor did she offer to call other hotels to help us find a room or offer any kind of information about where to go. Worst customer service ever. Stupidly small parking lot (that does not look safe at all). I would avoid this hotel!!!! We ended up going to a hotel close to this one (Pacific View Inn.....NOT to be confused with the Pacific Shores Inn)....even though that hotel was full too, the man working there took the time to help me out and made some great suggestions. I do apologize for the mistake of my hotel and your reservation. I will stress the importance of taking care of every person, whether a guest or not. I will use these comments in my next training meeting. Thank you for letting me know about your experience.
We stayed at PSI for 3 nights in Premium room 33. The view from the room was spectacular even though it was partial ocean view but it was so soothing to sea the ocean and waves from your bed.Theres a table and chairs outside the room to enjoy the view while having tea/coffee. The hotel is just a minute walk to the beach and few minutes from the pier. The breakfast was just ok with muffins, croissants, tea, coffee and juices , just for takeaway as theres no place to sit and eat. The only thing that sucked was the WiFi . It really took hours to connect. Overall its a nice place to stay. Would stay again if they improve the WiFi quality and the breakfast.
the room was good, smelt very strongly of bleach when we first arrived, but I guess that means they were cleaning!! Loved the location, so convenient to the beach, a lovely walk along the oceanfront to the pier and lots of restaurants and supermarkets close by. Loads of parking,but didn't really need the car once we were there.Thank you, Michael. Your review was very nice and I'm really glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We are in the process of updating our first section of rooms again this fall, so everything should be very fresh. I hope you willl stay with us again.
My family and I have stayed at this hotel three times now. Each time we are quite pleased. It is an exceptional value given how close it is to the beach and other San Diego amenities. The front desk staff is top notch, friendly, courteous and helpful. Special commendation to Jim Silver (GM), Alpha, Daniel and Oscar.Thank you for staying with us a number of times!! We are happy that you keep returning to stay with us. We never take it for granted that you will come back, so we try to keep our service up to a standard that hopefully anyone would want to stay. Thank you, again! We hope to see you soon!
Stayed in room with kitchenette, 2 doubles and sofa sleeper. Quite roomy, cute with patio set on balcony outside room. Can walk down to beach, within 1 block away. Numerous restaurants, shops within walking distance also. Continental breakfast scant, with coffee and sweets, but only negative I experienced there. Kitchen had full size stove and fridge. Easy drive to seaworld and maritime museum. Unfortunately weather was cold and rainy during our 3 days there, so put a damper on our visit. Didn't get to see as much as we wanted to. We loved the maritime museum and harbor cruise and my boys couldn't get enough of the USS Midway museum! I would definately return to this nice little inn!
We had a quick weekend concert in San Diego and decided to stay at the Ramada based on its proximity to the venue and price. The staff here are incredible. They're friendly and helpful beyond the norm. Our room was extremely clean, quiet and had a hot tub! The whole stay was extremely enjoyable and we will stay here again when we return to San Diego.We always appreciate when one of our valued guests takes the time to provide us with feedback. It is particularly gratifying when a guest, such as yourself, acknowledges the efforts of our amazing team! We at Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld, make every effort to give our guests a comfortable and pleasurable experience during a stay with us. We are happy to know that you were so pleased with all aspects of your recent visit and we look forward to seeing you again soon! Thanks so much!
This older hotel is in a great location, close to shopping, beaches, and other attractions. Lots of places to eat nearby. The hotel staff were friendly and very responsive and we loved the free parking! The rooms have been recently remodeled and were clean and spacious. Recommend the hotel purchase and install blackout curtains for the rooms to block outside lights that shine into the rooms. Also, there are no elevators to the second floor rooms. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.It is wonderful to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with us here at Ramada Limited San Diego! We are glad you found our accommodations to be clean, comfortable and ideally located in the city. Our staff is always available to help and is dedicated to ensuring our guests' needs are met. We appreciate your high regard and compliments! Thank you for the suggestion on the blackout curtains. We will keep this in mind during future updates. It would be a pleasure to see you again during any future visits to the area!
I loved my stay here! Friendly staff, rooms were clean, and it's right next to some of the best restaurants. It isn't far from the beach either. John referred us to many great places and was a big help. We are thrilled to hear you loved your stay! Thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego during your recent travels.It is always great when our team members receive recognition for their hard work and friendly demeanor. Your kind words will be passed along!Come back any time!
Staff was friendly and out going. Room was clean and received room service while out with the family. Very happy to have stayed at this place. Only thing i did not like was I could hear everything going on outside beyond closed doors as it woke me up each time I heard someone speak or doors slammed. Perhaps better insulation would help with that issue. Other than that, everything else was great! Thanks for a good stay! It was a pleasure hosting you and your family during your recent travels to San Diego! We hope you had the chance to enjoy some of the sights and attractions our city has to offer. Your encouraging words to our friendly staff members will be shared with the team to ensure they receive your recognition. Thank you for choosing our conveniently located accommodations for your stay and for taking the time to let us know how we are doing. It saddens us to know anything was less than perfect and you experienced some high noise levels. During your next visit to the area, we hope to be given the chance to better accommodate you and ensure you receive the restful night you deserve. Once again, thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego.
we arrived at 11 am with confirmation from our booking agent that clearly states an early check in at 9.30am. there was no room for us, but the receptionist did say she would get a cleaner on to a room straight away. we looked around for a seat, there was a sofa that had stains all over it, we choose a table with cereals and other crumbs on it, it was the best table available in there. after an hour of waiting the receptionist lunch was delivered by a local takeaway, which she ate and had a soda to wash it down after 2 hours of waiting and no refreshments offered we were told our room was ready. it was a room that I had seen the cleaner clean when we first arrived, she had cleaned two more since that room but we were kept waiting. it was a strange room, your bathroom had a shower and toilet the sink was in the kitchen area which double up as a kitchen sink. the next day we went to checkout and the same receptionist was working, I went to hand in my key but was kept waiting while she was putting polish on her finger nails, while we waited for her, we spoke to another couple who were sat on the same table we sat the day before, they also had confirmation for an early check in but no room was ready. finally all the receptionist nails were done and she took our key . there was no goodbye, thank you, how was your stay.....nothing. we would not recommend this hotel to anyone. we have even told our travel agent how bad it was and they have said that they just went by the Ramada name brand.....well we wont be staying at that hotel next time we visit san diegoComments from our guests are extremely appreciated as they allow us to better understand how we can improve our accommodations. We are very sorry to hear you experienced anything other than friendly and courteous service during your stay. Your report of the level of service you received upon arrival and departure, is alarming as our team is usually known for their professional and helpful attitudes. This issue will be addressed immediately. Your feedback will be used as a training opportunity. It is our hope that you will consider staying with us again so we can deliver the experience you were expecting. Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
We had a great stay at this hotel mostly due to the great location. There were restaurants, fast food and market within walking distance. My family had many rooms and we had many kids and the staff was very nice to them. The continental breakfast was perfect and the rooms were very clean. All the rooms had a fridge and microwave. Thanks to all the staff for the enjoyable stay.
Angel was knowledgeable about the city and provided us with tons of advice. The room was pretty nice and clean. Heard they got a remodel and we really enjoyed it. Grocery store was right around the corner, room had a fridge, and we got a 50points to use LIFT (which were also great people). Only thing was a random tear in the curtain everything else was perfect.Lynn,It is delightful to hear that our accommodations met and fulfilled your expectations. We are happy to know our team also contributed to the value of your stay. Our staff member appreciate your recognition of their friendly and helpful service. The next time you find yourself in San Diego, we hope you consider staying with us!
This is old hotel located on a loud main road. Don't look for a good nights sleep here because of the noise from cars racing up and down the street. Other noise makers were the garbage truck is there at 7:00 am and someone was running a jack hammer around the same time. The curtain was ripped. Trim limbs falling on cars. The pastries for the continental breakfast were stale and only bananas were there for the fruit. Coffee taste like old motor oil.Dear Janet,Thank you for taking a moment to provide your valuable feedback. We would like to apologize that your stay did not meet your expectations or our standards. We are truly sorry the outside noise level was distracting. We will certainly look into your concerns regarding breakfast and the parking lot tree limbs as our goal is to provide each guest with a safe and enjoyable experience. Again, thank you for your time and feedback.
It's close to the airport and easy to get to without much traffic if you know what you're doing. Clean enough for most folks. Free parking. Flat screen TV, microwave, fridge, internet worked well. Free breakfast included regular and decaf coffee, juices, pastries, cereal, 2 milk, muffins, bagels, hot water for tea and toaster waffles. Very good Mexican fast food across the busy street.please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response by continuing to focus on making each and every guest experience the best it can be. On behalf of the Front Desk and Management we thank you very dearly for taking your valuable time to write this great review. We would like you to know that it is our pleasure to serve our guest and we really appreciate getting positive feedback on our hard work. Please come visit us again in order to enjoy every new improvement that is made on a daily basis, we promise to make your visit more enjoyable with every stay.Again, thank you for completing our survey and if I can be of assistance to you, don't hesitate to contact me directly at 619 225 1295.
Great accommodating staff at the front desk. We had a very specific need for a first floor room and they bent over backwards to make it happen for us when the hotel was basically already full of folks already checked-in. Great shower and super clean, modern room.
Remodeled rooms were a pleasant surprise, Very inexpensive hotel with good wifi. Very close to Old Town, the Hotel Circle loop, and the Murph.The only challenge is the parking, the hotel is a horse shoe with parking within the horse shoe, seems like all spots are compact spots so very tight.
Parking is a serious issue there, we came back and had no parking due to stupid people taking up two parking areas, areas are extremely small as it was, night manager got busy to fix the problem, my suggestion is that each spot be numbered to the room, night manager moved his motorcycle so I could park a brand new car (week old) but my son in law had to crowd into a small area due to stupid stupid people, the next morning I learned that if there is an event across the street people park in your lot, no one should be parking there except paying customers!!!!!!! No customer should be inconvenienced at all either!!!!!! We left Bay Inn Suites up the street since it looked like a Motel 6 thrown up, that was totally misleading internet information. Again, no one should have to deal with parking their car when they are paying customer ever. Let's clean it up especially around the area by some type of vending machine or something, pretty trashy there so that next time I come it looks 100 better.We are very grateful of your feedback. Thank you for staying with us during your recent trip to San Diego.We apologize for the parking issues you experienced and we will take your suggestions into consideration. Unfortunately as we are located in a central location of such a busy city, parking is often hard to find. Many other properties in the area have begun charging a fee for parking as a solution to this dilemma. With that being said, we agree that our guests should not have trouble finding parking while staying at our accommodations. We are glad our night manager was able to help out but we will continue searching for a solution to this. We hope you consider staying with us again.
Clean, but otherwise unappealing. Terrible indoor lighting. Room was recently updated, but some old features were left in place.Hello and thank you for sharing your review on our Hotel. I am glad to read that you found the cleanliness of the rooms, met your expectations. Our house keeping team works very hard to make sure the rooms are in the best conditions for all of our guests. I would like to thank you for your business and I hope we get the opportunity to host you again.
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone .. Room was not clean .doors were creaking. beds not comfy.. water in the sink was so poor that it takes minutes to get brush . very bad
Come here when I have business in San Diego. Great staff, nice clean rooms, and around a lot of restaurants. Have yet to have anything remotely close to a problem here! Nice place! We're pleased to hear you've only had good experiences at Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld! Our friendly staff works hard to ensure you are welcomed to clean, comfortable rooms and a stress-free atmosphere. It's good to know our location, near a lot of shops and dining, works well for you. We hope this means you'll be back soon. Happy travels!
I was very pleased with the room we stayed in. It was clean and updated. We had a microwave, fridge and table in our room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There are parrots right outside your door which are fun to watch. This hotel is located in close proximity to Sea World and several beaches. We had a blast and would definitely recommend.

We take pride in providing our guests with friendly customer service, clean, comfortable accommodations, and special amenities to make their stay with us a memorable experience. We hope we will have the opportunity to have you and your family back as our guests again in the future!
I had a great experience here. The staff were friendly and gave us different attractions to do that were close by. The room was great. My reservations stated we would have a view but we didn't but that was fine because we didn't have the window open. When we go back to Sea World next year we will book this hotel again. The internet was a little slow but that was okay.It was our pleasure to serve you during your stay at the Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld. We apologize for any miscommunication with regards to your room with a view, but we are pleased to know that our helpful staff, comfortable accommodations, and many area attractions made for a wonderful experience during your trip. It's great to hear you will be booking your stay with us next year for your trip back to Sea World. We look forward to seeing you then, and thank you for the five-star review!
On arrival looked like regular motel that could use upgrading. The bed in the room had stained pillows and the phone did not work. We reported the problem at the front desk and were given a new room which appeared to be newly painted with a wooded floor (very nice). We were on the second floor (recommended) as lot of street noise and parking lot. Only problem with second floor lots of stairs. The employees were very helpful and friendly.The location is a bus stop away from seaworld and there are fast food and restaurants within walking distance. Uper and lyft available also taxi. I would stay again if in area.Long walk to storesJames, We always appreciate the chance to make our guests feel more comfortable during their stay thus, we thank you for notifying our front desk of the issues you encountered in your first room. We are delighted to know we were able to improve your stay with our helpful and friendly service. It is exciting to hear we may receive the privilege of hosting you again. Once again, thank you for your kind compliments! During any future stays, we hope you will always let us know if there is anything we can do to ensure you have the best stay possible.
This property is a good deal for the price. Room was larger and nicer than it looks in pics and was clean. The only problem with this place is the parking is limited and spots that are available are harder to get into. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego/near SeaWorld for your recent visit. Our parking lot is more for your compact cars, so when a truck from worker stays with us it can throw off the spacing. We are continuing to explore what we can do to create more room for the vehicles . Thank you for your feedback. We hope you choose us again for your next visit.regardsBen
Checking in was fast and easy the room was nice and had a modern look to it they definitely need to have better (cleaner) towels and please upgrade your Tvs the one in room 128 had no remote and when I report it they could not fixes the problem .Dear Gerardo, We appreciate you sharing your experience with us. It's great to hear that checking in was so efficient and easy. We'd like to apologize for any inconvenience you encountered with our TV. Although we regret that were unable to rectify the situation at the time, we are working on correcting it. Your comments regarding our towels will also be mentioned to our housekeeping staff, in order to maintain our high cleanliness standards. They are more than happy to assist with these matters when notified. That being said, We're very glad that you enjoyed your room's modern dcor. Your constructive feedback enables us to improve, and we'd love an opportunity to make your next stay even better.
Very nice room, very clean, very close to eating establishments, close drive to any and everywhere.
Clean rooms, great services, wooden floor is 100 nicer than nearby hotels at the same price level. The bed was more comfortable than expected.
The people were nice. Service was great! Would like a little more variety for breakfast but it was good. I liked that the room was very clean and had wooden floors. The outside doesn't look that great but the stay was good and it was comfortable.Thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld. We are so happy to hear that our service was a hit! It is our belief that every guest deserves the very best of our awesome city. When you are searching for another great value here in the area, look no further than us!
I used to live in San Diego and remember this area as filled with street walkers. I'm glad to report that the area has been cleaned up. The motel is very nice and comfortable. I like the tile floors. WiFi is speedy. Free breakfast is cereal and pastries.Welcome back to San Diego! It sounds like things have changed for the better. We are glad you trusted our accommodations to provide you with the comfort you were seeking. It is great to know our WiFi worked appropriately and you had a chance to take advantage of our complimentary breakfast. Thank you for sharing your positive comments with us and we hope to see you again during your next trip back to San Diego.
Stayed one night in this hotel recently. Excellent location (10 minutes to San Diego Zoo, 15 to Gaslamp). Very friendly gentleman working at the front desk upon check in. Provided lots of information and suggestions on where to visit in the area. For the price it is fine, but I would not recommend staying more than one night. The rooms were updated recently which is a plus.On the minus side, be sure to request a 2nd floor room. We were on the first floor, and heard every single step from the people above us. Nothing but booms and rumbling. Must not be a lot of insulation between the ceiling, and the floor in the above room.Glad to hear you enjoyed our convenient location to various attractions and entertainments in the San Diego area! It's always wonderful to hear that our of our team members were able to make your stay better by providing you with helpful and friendly service. Thank you for your kind words in regards to our recently renovated accommodations. We are very sorry to learn you experienced some noisy neighbors and we wish you would have let us know you were being disturbed. We appreciate your tip to future travelers. We would consider it a privilege to have you stay with us again and be able to provide you with another even better stay. Come back soon!
An older motel, but okay you get what you pay for. Drain in the sink ran very slowly. No remote for TV. Leak in lobby. Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your review. I am sorry to hear that your stay with us was anything other than great. Thank you for your business.
leaky toilet, remote didn't work, promised high speed Internet not at all available. Manager blamed Cox after desk clerk had me speak with someyahoo techie in New Jersey who I couldn't even understand. Smelly rooms.Construction all over. Noisy air conditioner that wouldn't cycle properly. Butthe good news Could see fireworks from nearby Seaworld.
We were greeted by the front desk when we arrived 3 hours prior to our check in. We were treated with respect. She guided us where we can have meals and stored our luggage. The rooms were given as early as it was ready. Loved that the room did not have carpets for allergy sufferers. Clean room. Close to Sea world and Old town. Loved the stay. Here at the Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld, we love to accommodate! We're delighted that you got to experience the extraordinary hospitality of our team. As you noted, our location is perfect for taking in the sights of San Diego, and it is great to hear that you took advantage. Thank you for the five-star review, and we hope to see you again soon!
I would not recommend walking in the room barefoot, I tried my feet always needed to be washed before bed. We did appreciate the free bottled water each day, much better than trying to go through TSA. :)Glad you enjoyed our extra detail of including water bottles for our guests. Thank you for sharing your experience with us and for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego. We apologize that you had to wash your feet before bed and we will look into changing our cleaning products to ensure they are not leaving residue on the floor. We would love to host you again during any future visits to San Diego!
They've updated their rooms so it's brand new everything and also the bathroom is nice and spacious and clean. The price to me was reasonable per night. I'll definitely be staying again!!! Also, the have free breakfast in the morning. The guy at the front desk was so polite and very down to earth which made this an easy experience.
We were advised well in advance of our stay that there would be a power outage. We decided to stay anyway since we would only be sleeping. We were provided with push lights upon check in. Very clean room! The wood look tile was a welcome change from dingy carpet.Many thanks for your kind review of Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld! Our team believes in being proactive and we glad you felt our advance preparation for the power outage was quite professional. With that said, it's great to know that our immaculate accommodations and tile floors met your expectations for a pleasant stay. Your thoughtful praise means a great deal to us and we'd love you to visit us again.
We stayed for three nights in late July 2015. Rooms have been recently renovated and are nice, though beds were a bit hard and squeaky. The continental breakfast was not fancy but good quality and selection, and there is an outdoor patio upstairs (insider tip) with 5 or 6 little tables and maybe a dozen chairs that made for a chill start to our pleasant mornings. The front desk staff was very helpful with suggestions and directions, and check in / out was easy. A good value, not fancy but not bad. I'd stay there again.
I booked this hotel because it had decent reviews and the price was cheap. The things I liked was mainly the location. It was very close to nearby attractions such as Sea World and Mission Beach. There were also markets and stores nearby if you need any essentials. I also enjoyed nearby places to eat that were local eats at reasonable prices. Another plus was that I was able to get 2 queen beds at the same price as 1 King. Also, no charge for parking.I didn't like how the towels were stained and dirty. The room was musty and the AC unit was under the window so whenever the fan was blowing, the curtains would fly up. The breakfast was minimal with different breads and pastries and bananas.Thank you for choosing to stay with us during your recent visit to San Diego. We consider all guest feedback to be an opportunity to improve and we really appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts. We agree that we are ideally located near SeaWorld and other attractions and entertainments. We strive to provide our guests with clean, comfortable accommodations at an affordable price. We apologize that upon arrival you found your room to be musty. We encourage our guests to let us know if they have any issues while they are staying with us so we can ensure to make the appropriate amends. In the future, we hope you choose to stay with us again and give us the chance to provide a wonderful experience.
Traveling with a two teens for beach time and concert at the Observatory. A straight shot to the beach from the motel, restaurants not walking distance, but short trip by car. Central to all that the area offers. The rooms are clean, comfortable beds w/lovely linens. Little scrimpy on the bath products, but no problem asking for more. We were... More
I liked this hotel for its excellent location, its right on the beach, has a pier extending into the lake and has a beachfront Restaurant. The views of the lake and surrounding mountains from the hotel and beach are incredible. Also there is Safeway( grocery store) right across the hotel and nearby there are several restaurants. What I didn't like... More
It's located right on the lake and across from a Safeway. The hotel has hammocks for their guests, great for just hanging out. The hotel is walking distance to a lot of restaurants. We dined at the Boathouse and the Tavern. Boathouse worth it, Tavern meh.
A very nice room. Quiet with a lake view. We appreciated that there were two restaurants, so we didn't have to get in our car to go anywhere. The bed was very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back. I liked the balcony and fireplace.These were nice added touches.
Great Hotel, great staff. Staff was friendly helpful, cared about our business satisfaction wanting to make it the best possible. Hotel is right on the beach for relaxing location, but perfectly located near casinos, shopping restaurants. Room was clean spacious, all amenities were present that could be asked for even tho we never turned on tv,... More
Jeremy at the front desk was great. He was warm and welcoming after our long drive, got us into a great room quickly, and had some helpful tips. The room was nice with a small balcony and a view of the lake and pier. There was a nice fireplace too. The Boathouse was great. It is our favorite place to... More
OVerall location and hotel stay was very good, everything was excellent other than following. Building is little old so you can here people walking on the floor above you and I couldnt use any of the public area in this hotel as this hotel doesnt prohibit smoking in public area so if you have kids and dont want to expose... More
Location wise this place is perfect. But rooms were small,walking areas and elevator also very small. Front counter service was good. Staff was helpful.Pet friendly hotel. Bit pricey compare with the other hotels in a same area. Rooms does not have microwave or refrigerator .
Great Location! King bed room was very nice with fireplace. Clean grounds and room. Comfy bed. Starbucks coffee in rooms. Short walk to the beach. They do have two restaurants. Easy check in. We will stay again.
Overall the hotel was fairly nice and had very good access to the beach. The room was a bit small and the shower was tiny. The room was well decorated and the hotel staff were very friendly. I would stay here again. There was a sock found in the corner of our room upon arrival which may indicate the room... More
We were fortunate to have an occasion to stay a night at the Beach Retreat Lodge at Tahoe. When you can throw a stone from the property into Lake Tahoe, you've found the right location. We were greeted by a polite and professional staff who made out check-in a breeze. Our room was fairly small but it was very... More
Not worth the price and the room is the size of a closet, and just horrible maintenance, dents on the doors, Motel 6 would of been better. Don't ever ever stay there!!! And the front desk is no help you have to goto the bar to get ice in your ice bucket
This hotel is a hidden gem in S. Lake Tahoe. Very helpful, friendly staff. Hotel is just steps to the beach. The Tavern was good for nachos, hamburgers, etc. The Boathouse was on the pier with a wonderful view of the sunset over the lake!
This was our first stay at Lake Tahoe. The location was excellent. We enjoyed the beach access. It was nice to be able to walk out your room and on the beach to watch the sunset every evening. We also liked being able to rent kayaks and stand up paddle boards right there at the beach. The rooms are modest... More
My husband and I stayed at the Beach Retreat during the Christmas holidays in 2015. This was our second visit to this resort, and I have to say we enjoyed our stay even more than the first visit (although I didn't think it was possible). Our room was once again immaculate! After a great workout on the slopes, it was... More
Perfect location great food staff is wonderful very kind and will to go the extent mile with in walking distance of shopping beautiful view of the lake from balconies. Beach bar is a nice touch restraint over the water perfect for sunset dinner
Staff was ok,nothing special. Our room was cute and cozy. I loved the fireplace and that we had beach access from our back door. Overall it was a nice relaxing place that I will definitely be back to enjoy.
This place was great.. relaxing.. and kid friendly also. My family and I enjoyed out time there and it was really a lot of fun. The food was excellent and it was all very well priced. My family and I will be back during the summer months.
If you wanna be on the Lake, near Heavenly and bring your dog this is THE place! We didn't want to leave our dog behind at 40/day...and this hotel afforded us to bring her and with the charge...it's pretty break even. We were on the ground floor and our Fireplace had problems-guy had to come and light it and put... More
Great host. Good security measure. Have elevator. Clean and newly renovated room. Cheap motel in the city. Near to bus stop heading to fishermen's wharf. Walk-able distant to City hall and other attractions.Wifi may not work during peak hours ie 7pm-12am but very smooth in early morning or midnight. No aircon, so you have to open the window for fresh air. Some noise from gangs and traffic maybe heard but it didnt greatly affect our sleeping quality.If you are going to the motel from Civic center Bart station, try to avoid Hyde,Larkin and Polk street and use Van Ness Ave to avoid homeless and the smell of pee.
This was a very inexpensive hotel my coworker and I booked, not knowing the status of the area.The staff was friendly, which helps when realizing what sort of neighborhood it's located in.The pros: it's a cheap hotel, the Bart transit subway is not too far of a walk. Busses are on all surrounding streets. You're surrounded by many different restaurants of all varieties of ethnic and American foods.The rooms are large and the beds are comfy. The room thermostats don't work well so good luck with controlling your room temperature.Ice machine is in the garage but easy to get to.The ConsElevators are slow.The rooms are extremely thin so, if you don't mind noise and traffics orchestras, then you're good. Don't book here if you want silence or scenic views.It's an area of vagrants, homeless, and transients that may make you wary of wanting to wander around in the evenings. It didn't bother me but I could see it for those who can't handle it.I can sleep through anything so, I was at home.The WIFI works and I've not had problems doing work. Hot water is great when taking a shower.If I had a choice to stay here again, I'm might, but make it the last resort.Walgreens is only a block up to get last minutes sundries. Several coffee shops are available, and there are close nearby markets to get beer or cigs.None of the vagrants ever bothered me and I did not feel unsafe like a few of the other reviews I've read prior to booking.I did feel that this hotel can be better if the owners took some money and time to repaint, upgrade the plug in outlets, and added some affordable bathroom upgrades. More importantly, you're in SF, let this place be where you sleep, and enjoy the wonderful city.:)
The people who run this place couldn't be nicerThey explained exactly which areas to avoid after dark, and what we need to see in SFFollowing the lady's advice, we had a great timeNo rooms were on the ground floor and there were security measures for lift access, so we had no qualms about securityThe room was impeccably clean, and we even witnessed them changing the sheets before the second night of our stayLack of A/C was a bit of a problem as it was unusually hot during our stay, but that shouldn't be an issue most of the timeBed was comfortable, shower was excellent, and they give you lovely soapWe discovered a great place for breakfast - the Olympic Flame CafeIt's about a 10-minute walk towards Union SquareWalk to Geary Street and take a right. The cafe is on the right, opposite the Adagio Hotel (fancy architecture) a couple of blocks before Union Square
San Francisco is ridiculously expensive city for accommodation. We picked this hotel based upon its price within TA. Its an easy walk from the Bart Station but walk up Polk St!It is in a sketchy area of San Fran. Polk St during the day is fine and you should be ok using Van Ness at night (we were on several occasions). There is also a CVS and Walgreens up Van Ness for basics. No rooms on ground floor and the elevator is the only way up and only staff can buzz you in the door to use the elevator so you are completely safe.Rooms basic. Very basic but clean although a refurbishment would be good. Theres an Ice machine and esky/cooler that you can use free of charge to take to your room. Wifi worked ok. Limited airflow in rooms since no air con or fan. Had to ask front desk for a fan and they seemed a little offended to be honest.You will hear all kinds of stuff at night from further down in the Tenderloin but you will sleep fine. For the price it is kind of a rough deal compared to basically anywhere else in the world, hence the rating. But for San Francisco at a budget rate, its ok for afew nights.
I spent 3 nights in this hostel, it's grand if you just want to lay your head down for a couple of hours. But you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in your room. The place is very smelly, our rooms stank. It is in a very good location, everything you need is just around the corner. There is a free bar in the hostel, but it only lasts for about an hour so you may only get one beer and if your lucky two (small can of Budwiser). it's very very basic. You can tell the bed sheets are a good few years old. I wouldn't stay there again if i am honest.
Norman Bates fundo este sitio, seguro. Sucio y ruidoso, si, es un hostel, pero he estado en muchos y este se lleva la palma en sentido negativo, por suciedad, organizacin, etc. Solo merece la pena su ubicacin, que si que es realmente buena.
If you want to simulate what your life would be like if you were captured by a band of terrorists and the room you would get, then you cannot beat this hostel. The front desk and kitchen/common area are clean and staffs are helpful and courteous. The elevator is kinda old and interesting too, be sure to check that out. You can also meet fellow inmates whom you can make friends.Rooms and stairway are small, squeaky and smelly, and lights works half of the time, just as in horror movies. Washroom have no toilet paper and toilet may lack flushing lever/button. If you are lucky you can find one that had both but have no lightbulb so you must take a dump in the dark. Shared shower for men have plenty of hairs and body tissues, with not a drop of running water...maybe the shared shower for females had better luck.In term of value then I would still recommend this hostel, because front desk services are good, and that you should not whine about living experience when you pay below average in SF.
We are now towards the end of our CA holiday. After staying in quite a few hostels now unfortunately this one wasn't the best of the bunch. But as you will read from the countless other reviews it serves a purpose. Its cheap (comparatively), central location, and has lots of communal space.We had a 4 person room without an ensuite. There was only 1 shower on each floor so plan your showering time accordingly. Despite the ageing building everything was kept clean by the staff.We had a constant water trickling noise in our room from pipes behind a wall. As with most hostels, ear plugs are essential. Also despite there being no visible heat source in the room, at night it was crazy hot.
We were woken up in the middle of the night by the radiator which was scalding hot and hissing. When we complained to staff they were disinterested, and carelessly moved us into a different room, it took them 3 attempts to find us a room without the same problem. When we spoke to the manager in the morning to ask for some sort of compensation for being put in a room with a dangerous radiator, and for being moved 3 times in the middle of the night, she nonchalantly informed me that this is what you get for 20 and they have a no refund policy. This is not my understanding of a no refund policy. Please don't waste your money here. The toilets don't even have sinks.
My partner booked us a twin bed room thinking it was the San Francisco Hostel International. What a mistake! We were given an incredibly squeaky (aka you can't roll over without waking up the whole floor including yourself) single bunk bed with stained mattresses. There was also some kind of unidentified matter smeared across the wall which could have easily been cleaned if they could be bothered. The bathrooms, halls etc we're all equally filthy.We asked to be changed into a twin bed room (as we had booked) or a double and we're constantly fobbed off by each staff member. Each would tell us to come back and speak to them again in x hours (when their shift had finished). When we went back they would be gone and it would start again. This also included the manager. I understand this place is closing in a few months (my guess is due to being shut down by health and safety) and as a result the staff do not care in the least. If you have another option then take it. And before you think this person sounds like a prude or is being precious I have stayed in probably 100 hostels allover the world and this is by far the worst. It also really affected our holiday in San Fran as there was no chance of sleep in the squeaky bunk bed. I note there are some decent reviews however most of them seem to be for the other hostel we tried to book (there ain't no waffles here!).You've been warned!!!
The one who checked me in doesn't know how to smile, the whole building is showing age, even the beds are showing age, the elevator hasn't been changed since they built the building, you will get a free pancakes if you wanna stand for half an hour and sometimes for more than that, bathrooms are not so clean, the lockers are located only on the first floor and you can use it if you have your own padlock, location is great,
We have traveled extensively prior, and have stayed at many hostels of similar price range, this one however, is a whole new experience for us. At the check in, the staff opened not with the availabilities of their facilities, but with the offer of free alcohol, every single day. What they didn't say, was that the staff themselves drank most of the free booze, and were hungover most of their shifts. The were more interested in sharing their drunken antics rather than providing any help to the customers. There was only one girl Billy who spoke English (and she's the least useful one out of them all), the rest of the staff spoke very little English and had trouble understanding us.The free alcohol turned lots of the hostel guests into violent drunks, who threw knives at each other in the kitchen whilst cooking.Hostel was extremely noisy and was impossible to sleep without earplugs. The mattress was creaky and filthy, and we didn't even dare to cover ourselves with their blankets, on which we had presumed was dried blood.
The room is small and hot. It was quite warm and stuffy in the room. It was old and run down. There is no individual bathroom for the room. However, this location is the dream. It is a 2min walk from Powell train station and 2min walk from Union Square. Close to many food places. It is approximately 30 min fast walk to Fishermans wharf or 10 min tram ride. The location is outstanding and I suppose you get what you pay for in that aspect. Wouls stay there again for a 1-2 night basis but any longer would not be ideal.
LOOK.. i have stayed in many places:This place is the WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER STAYED IN.IF you are a basic backpacker that does not care whatsoever about elemental hygene, and are planning to be absolutley drunk whilst here..then I recommend this place. However, if you are a normal human being and expect clean sheets, and not pubes stuck to walls and absolutley filthy carpet that trust me you can SMELL has NEVER BEEN CLEANED..and just a HORRID room full of bed bugs, then you will not want to stay here. Dont spend your money here. The people running this place would NEVER pass a health inspection..absolutley never. And i will be complaining. Because since I have been back I have had rashes all over my body. I just cant believe that people can get away with a place like this.try other hostels, we saw other nice ones whilst there. The bathrooms have full hairs in sink, and half eaten food everywhere..it was just a nightmare. ANY place should at least have clean sheets and not sheets filled with stains, and all different old sheets that had never been washed. A complete disguiting example of a hostel. Apalled. Oh and if you see good reviews..TRUST me its because the writers are proably backpackers (that are prob 16 and have never left home) and were absiolutley drunk and looking to party and they stayed here because they got free beer. BIG excitement..beer is like 5 bucks..go buy some and stay somwhere descent. Thats all
I stayed here on business and had incredible stay. The hotel is in a great location near a lot of restaurants and shopping. Bill at the front desk was extremely helpful as well as the rest of the staff. The service of the staff is second to none.

I stayed at this hotel while attending an expo in Louisville Kentucky. The staff was very friendly, quick check in and out, and the hotel was very clean. It had a good location and the staff was knowledgeable of the area and gave great recommendations for dinner. Would definitely stay there again!!!

Great staff, comfortable rooms but the noise factor is a killer. You will hear it every time the person in the room above you moves their chair or runs the water. The staff are amazing and can't do enough to try and make your stay a great one.The concierge lounge is nice but small if you are planning on holding a meeting in a corner.Good Afternoon Harris TThank you for your positive review about our staff and our comfortable rooms. We apologize for the noise issue you experienced during your stay and will share it with the team. Thank you again for staying with us.
This hotel worked very well for a conference .. Very comfortable room, very clean, very courteous staff, and a great restaurant on site with room service. Nice fitness room and pool looked great. A ride brief ride on the free shuttle to OHare, but a 45 min train ride to downtown Chicago. This hotel in walking distance to something interesting would have been a 5. Still, the L train has a stop right there, so if you have more time than I did, the city is accessible. The only irritating downside was getting nickel/dimed for wifi. Still, the staff were top notch and the food was great and the facility is very nice inside (exterior is plain), so it was a very good stay.
I stayed at this hotel in connection with a trade conference. Overall, the stay was very nice in a clean, mostly comfortable room. Check-in was quick and easy and the staff was attentive and friendly which is typical of most Marriotts. While I do not generally like to eat at the hotel, sometimes this is unavoidable and it was nice that this hotels food and service was better than average. The lobby bar and staff was excellent but a bit loud. The room while fresh and clean had a small bathroom , all of the pillows were too thick for my liking and I had a difficult time finding the right balance between room temperature and bedding thickness. The first morning the in-room coffee maker melted down (things do break) and to the hotel staffs credit, when I called the front desk they offered to send me a new maker and room service coffee at no charge so I would not need to wait as long. Both the new maker and the room service coffee arrived promptly and the room service waiter refused a tip. Its rare that I have experienced such outstanding problem resolution and customer service. Besides the pillows, the few negatives in my view were the very high cost of internet service, especially given the cost of the room, and the airport shuttle. The hotel is a distance from OHare and makes a stop at another property between this hotel and airport in both directions which contributed to shuttles rides with standing room only. Be sure to give yourself ample time during rush hour as traffic can back-up horribly. In summary, these are relatively minor issues and I would be pleased to stay here again thanks to the great staff.Dear Steve1362!Thank you for writing about your stay at our hotel. I am very happy to learn that we were able to make your visit enjoyable. We look forward to welcoming you back some time in the future! Best wishes for a happy holiday season.
The last time I visited the hotel, it felt tired and dispirited. This time it was was dynamic and bustling a result of the very nice make over of the hotel.The front office staff are efficient not overly friendly as they seem to be wildly over-loaded. The common areas, (bar) were quite nice and very busy.The name is a little deceiving, you would expect it to be right at the airport, but in fact it is a 5 to 10 minute shuttle ride away, along with all of the other hotels in the area.
You always hate to have flight delays due to weather problems - but this hotel had one room available and I was able to check in around midnight. The first level room was everything a Marriott typically provides - but the next morning when I opened up the sliding glass door was a wonderful surprise.... a nice view of a nature preserve!Dear B S:Thank you for your kind words and for staying with Marriott! Wishing you safe and delay-free travels!
I've stayed twice at this property - both times while running business meetings. I've been quite impressed with the staff's level of service. Their energy and attention to details have made a big difference in ensuring the meetings were successful.The hotel's facilities are well-designed and well-maintained. And while it's hardly a glamor spot, it's a VERY good choice for business travelers. It's actually quite a pleasant surprise!Dear BobRosenNY, thank you very much for taking the time to write about your visit's with us, we appreciate your business. I'll be sure to pass along your kind words and we hope to see you again in the future! Wishing you safe travels. Dieter Heigl
Stayed here overnight when a flight got cancelled. PROs - Great Staff, Clean, Close to ORD. CONs - Charge for Wifi, No breakfast, Cost.First the pros - my wife left her credit card in the room. After discovering two days later, she called the hotel. The card had been found and turned in and locked in the office safe. The director of security verified the info and shipped via Priority Mail back to us at no charge. This is unprecedented service and one we'll be forever thankful for. The room itself was exceptionally clean and well-appointed. Also, it's only about a 7 minute drive to ORD.Negatives - 12.95 charge for wifi is ridiculous in this day and age (I'm guessing because they can) there are relatively no restaurants around except for the wonderful Gino's East next door. Also, the cost was a little out of line for a close airport property.Dear Gatoric:Thank you for writing about your stay with us. I am happy to hear we were able to hear that we found your credit card and that you enjoyed the staff..Like most full service hotels of a major brand we do bill for services such as breakfast and internet separately from the guest room. From your note I gather that you prefer to have all inclusive pricing when you choose a hotel. There are a number of Marriott brands that will perfectly meet your preference such as Courtyard Hotels, Residence Inn and Springhill Suites. There is a Residence Inn near O'Hare as well as a Springhill Suites (which is located just 1 mile from our hotel.) I can recommend all of them. Thank you for staying with Marriott! Wishing you a pleasant summer. Dieter Heigl
The L-train stop (on the Blue line) is only a 5-minute walk away from the hotel, if you cut across the parking lot.The staff couldnt have been more helpful and their various kindnesses were greatly appreciated.I had an amazing suite with plenty of room to stretch out. The bedroom area contained a lovely Marriott bed and the large main bathroom had a powerful shower with plenty of space for products and two sinks. There was also a bathroom adjacent to the main living room area. Both of the flat-screen TVs had loads of channels (Direct TV), which was a big bonus.On the first night, the Exec lounge was closed due to some maintenance issues, but I was given a voucher for a free appetizer in the bar, complimentary soft drinks and free buffet breakfast in the restaurant the next morning (which was excellent and of a very high-quality).As promised, the next day the Exec lounge was open again in the evening. It had a good selection in the morning including a couple of hot items and several different types of bagels. It was busy though, due to a Pepsi conference being held in the hotel.I loved the outdoor pool and patio area, although it closed after Labor Day, which I thought was a pity during a Chicago heat wave. The indoor pool remained open during my stay.Strangely, on day 2 of my booking, my room was never made up. When I informed the staff, they nearly burst out crying and quickly sent up extra amenities and cleared away my overflowing rubbish bins.There is a large grocery store across the street (Dominick's) and several restaurants within easy walking distance.The free shuttle service took about 15 minutes to get to the airport.I look forward to staying at this property again the next time I'm in the Chicago area.4 out of 5 stars
It's a Marriott so you know the quality will be good. Attended a conference there in the fall so couldn't enjoy the courtyard pool as the weather was too cold. Kept too busy to really get the know the hotel but the standards you'd expect were there.Great breakfast buffet - but then again you pay big dullas for it... no different than any other 4 - 5 star. If you don't like planes, then stay away. The hotel is right under the final approach to one of O'Hare's runways. As one of the busiest airports worldwide, there's a big one on it's way down every few minutes. I sat on my balcony trying to have a conversation with a colleague eventually gave up went inside - the noise from the planes was just insane. The upside though is that you get a unique view of the belly of aircraft at low altitude. Interesting, even for that experience.Dear Swazimac - Thank you for taking the time to post a note regarding your recent stay at our hotel. We are delighted to hear that our recent 40 million investment of the hotel is being noticed as the hotel is a landmark in the area. Thank you also for the compliments in regards to food preparations. I am delighted to hear you enjoyed the breakfast buffet! But Im sorry to hear that your past stay was impacted by noise from air traffic. Unfortunately there is the occasional day when extreme weather conditions dictate that planes land at lower altitudes and I believe this may have had a big impact with regard to your stay. However, thermal pane windows in all of our guestrooms reduce noise factors. Should you find your travels back in Chicago and wish to stay with us again, please ask to be placed on a lower floor inside room. And fortunately, we are almost through the most severe rains Chicago has experienced in more than 50 years! Safe travels,
Stayed here while I was taking my ABEM oral boards which are given on the 6th-8th floors of the hotel so location was really convenient. 7 min free shuttle ride from O'Hare was nice. Facility itself is dated but very well kept and almost everything has been updated. Breakfast is 19 for buffet but very good. Decent workout facility. Walking distance to a couple diners (and Gino's East) but other than that you need to find a ride.
This hotel offers everything is advertises. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. Concierge lounge access does make a difference because you have a smaller lounge and dining area that is less noisy than the ground floor facilities. Also, the continental breakfast and light dinner is more than sufficient. The front desk staff face many challenges and some handle them better than others but they all try hard. During conferences the luggage trolleys are not to be found so sort out your own luggage on check out during the busy times.Dear Journeytime SA, thank you very much to your comments and taking the time to write. We thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay. Wishing you safe travels. Dieter Heigl
great comfy hotel, nice outdoor pool, friendly staff and amazing breakfast buffet. Only complaints are the lack of vegetarian dishes on the main menu and the only main course they have is inedible, and the pool would be better if there was a bar or coffee shop next to it where we could sunbathe and order a drink or a snack. apart from that my stay was epic and staff are so helpful!
I have stayed at a ton of Marriotts and know how they are supposed to work. This property is close to the airport in Chicago, but I will NOT consider staying at this hotel in the future. I found the front desk to be extremely rude. While the hotel itself is okay, there are a number of other properties in this general location happy to help with simple requests and appreciative of your loyalty.Dear Brad945,Thank you for being a valued Platinum Elite Member. Marriott is proud to have over 35 million members worldwide. We know our elite members are out there traveling more than 75 room nights per year so thank you for your loyalty. Our goal is to not only meet, but exceed your expectations so you may continue to travel brilliantly. I apologize we fell short on making you feel valued and for not going the extra mile to ensure all those little details were in place. I hope you give us another opportunity to regain your loyalty. I ask that you reach out to me when you arrive, so I may personally welcome you back!Wishing you safe travels,
Went for a weekend seminar for my career and it was lovely. Decorations look very modern with dark furniture and orange/bronze colors. Lovely Conference and Ball Rooms. Food was terrific and served coffee, tea and water in glasses instead of paper cups. Quiet room, fairly large, ice on hallway and I had a card to get to the top floor so I felt a little safer since I was traveling alone. Price was reasonable, checkout under the door (nice so you don't have to wait in a long line) and they held all the bags with security in a special room until the shuttle took us to the airport. I was a late traveler going home and had free internet all day while working in hallway and conference. Lovely newer shuttle bus took me to the airport at 5:45 pm. Shuttle runs 6am-11pm. Then late travelers can call between 11pm-6am and they will drive there to pick you up. Grounds and pool seemed nice and restaurant and bar always packed with happy people. Great view of the city and hotel is on final approach of airport. It was rather exciting to watch the planes going over the hotel especially at dusk. Highly recommend this hotel. Also convenient to take the shuttle across the freeway to the train and go downtown.Dear Kristin H.:Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay with us. We greatly appreciate all guest comments and are certainly happy to learn that you enjoyed your stay. Wishing you safe travels. Dieter Heigl
This is a nice hotel, but for the price one pays for a room I expected a little more. The Hampton Inn we stayed at in Freeport had bigger nicer rooms. The girl who checked us in was new, so it took a little longer than usual. WiFi is not free-12/day. The shuttle to the airport was on time with a friendly driver. It's an airport hotel, so expect to hear the noise of arriving/departing planes all night.Dear Travelinpretzel, thank you for taking thetime to write about your stay with us. I am sorry that your room was not big enough for your needs and as you noted we do bill separately for WiFi (it is available for free in the lobby though). Should you return to the area I can recommend the Marriott Suites just 1 mile west from our hotel or the Springhill Suites just 1 mile east from us, both have larger rooms and the Springhill Suites includes even internet in their rate. Thank you for staying with Marriott. Wishing you a pleasant fall! Dieter Heigl
Have stayed here many times in the past....imagine my surprise at the grand renovation! Can't beat the suburban location, V V Comfy beds. Airport noise not so bad with the fan on in the room. Great staff...do they give the, happy pills! can't wait for a return trip. Great value and location. Thanks!
Multiple delays and cancellations left us stuck partway home in Chicago...pulled out my phone with Marriott app and made a reservation right at the airline counter as lodging was becoming hard to find per the flight agents. We were welcomed to the hotel, got a clean room, ate dinner in the hotel lobby restaurant and were transported very early the following morning back to the airport, and finally home.Dear Astrid527,Thank you for taking the time to let us know how your recent stay was. We're glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and are safely back home. Wishing you safe travels and a happy holiday season!
This hotel was very nice and clean. We ate at the hotel restaurant and was good but seemed a bit pricey. They had a starbucks but it was incorporated with the bar so didn't really seem like a real starbucks to me. The rooms didn't have a microwave or a fridge. A fridge would have been nice since we ordered in some Chinese food but had no where to store the leftovers.Dear Jessica K.!Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your stay at our hotel and Brickton Restaurant. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay and the time at the hotel. Should you stay with us again and should need a refrigerator in your room please feel free to give us a call, we do have cooling units available for our guest's use. Thank you again for staying wiht Marriott! Whishing you safe travels and a great 2014.
We ended up staying here as a result of a long delayed flight back to the UK. The property is really nice, the rooms were large and we had two adjoining rooms one with a large king sized bed the other with two singles. The rooms are spacious, light and clean and the bathroom was really big in the king room. TV channels were great and I do like the Marriotts inclusion of Netflix on the TV's too. We ordered room service as we were really late, despite being past 11pm we were able to order an item from the pre-11pm menu. The two dishes were both seriously good and way beyond what I'd ordinarily expect for room service. The burger was succulent with a good bun and crispy bacon and I really recommend the Chef's special sandwich the brisket is to die for. Don't go for the chips though as ours were soggy. We arrived for breakfast bang on 10am having been told breakfast finished at 11am - which the ala carte does but the buffet finishes at 10 however the server and staff allowed us to continue with the buffet. All the food was great and the ability to have freshly cooked scrambled eggs is a real plus. We used the pool area, being able to swim inside and out was fun for the kids as was them watching me go from jacuzzi to pool as I invaribly froze! We had lunch by the pool, which was served with a good portion size of hummus and meat platter, the flatbread pizza was good with a very tasty sauce. The standout item for me though was the service. Service is so important and every single staff member we encountered appeared to go out of their way to please us, it was a great pleasure to stay at a hotel where the staff really were very accommodating and helpful and for this reason I would really recommend this hotel to anyone in need of an O'Hare hotel.
Friendly receptionists, clean and spacious rooms, good restaurant with a nice hot breakfast buffet. I was upgraded to a nice suite as a platinum member , a nice swimming pool , fitness center free airport shuttle and newly renovated lobby . Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Ohare and will definitely stay again.
My husband surprised me with a trip to Chicago to see Andrea Bocelli in concert, and we stayed here because it was near to the concert venue. The hotel was very nice and the room was comfortable, bed soft. We did not spend much time here, but there was a nice hotel bar and event center. It is close to the airport and the area in which it is located is not the prettiest, although it is just 5 minutes away from the Oak Park area which is beautiful.
Spent the weekend here. What I liked:- Good size rooms and clean with standard toiletries- Check-in and check-out process was smooth.- I did not order room service but looked at the menu and the food did not seem outrageously pricedFollowing are concerns in the hotel:- the conceirge lounge is not open on weekends. Was given a separate voucher for breakfast but you still can't get water, soda, or snacks in the evening.- the room did not have a fridge- this is not downtown chicago and charging 32 a night for car parking seems quite high- swimming pool is a combination of indoor and outdoor. The same and that was not encourag
We stayed at this property in advance of a week long trip with an 0700 flight time. Since we live 40 miles out, we decided to stay in town instead of driving in for our flight that morning. Our stay on the way out was lovely. We enjoyed a great meal in the bar, watched some of the Olympics and chatted with another guest who was in town covering the Arlington Million. Our room was lovely and we took a nightcap back to watch the planes fly over (every 2 minutes) and enjoy the sounds of the families at the pool. The fact that all of this was on the completely non-smoking property, it was a lovely evening. Our shuttle driver was promptly on site at 0530 to leave for the airport. But, of course, there was one guest who couldn't manage to be on time. While we arrived at the prescribed 10 minutes prior and others arrived in advance of the van arriving, the front desk called due to one, single guest who couldn't get his act together. Because they were so overly accommodating to him, I was completely blown away by the shuttle trip upon our return.We arrived at the airport, got our luggage and called the hotel. They informed us to go to door 2 at the shuttle center. We proceeded there - it is about a 7 minute walk for tired, suitcase lugging travelers. We arrived at the assigned door at 2316. With a number of vans there, we were trying to see what each of them were when we saw a Marriott van pull away and drive off - EMPTY. So, I called the hotel to ask whether their driver had just driven away even though we had called and he should have been alerted that there were travelers arriving. I was told that the van runs every half hour and that the next one would be at 2330. I inquired whether this meant that the van would be ON THE WAY or was expected to ARRIVE at that time. I never really got a clear answer. When a van finally arrived on the property at 2352, I started to understand WHY I wasn't given a clear answer. While we waited 36 minutes for a van, some others told us they had been waiting over an hour. Additionally, they stated they had called the hotel and been told that THEY missed the VAN. I am not sure how it is possible for the guest to MISS THE VAN - surely the driver has some responsibility for getting out and announcing himself when they are parked (stacked) in 2 lanes of traffic.Then, upon our arrival at the hotel, I used my parking ticket as instructed to leave the parking lot without paying the daily fees only to get an error message that my ticket was invalid and my fee due was 241.00. I tried 3 times and then started to go back to a parking space to walk back to the hotel and wait while the 40 people on the van got checked in to their rooms to get a valid ticket to get my car out of the lot when our friend noted that another gate was open for an event that was concluding. We pulled through it and left. I fly out of O'Hare on average 12 - 15 times per year for business and pleasure. I use park sleep fly once or twice a year. And I am an active Marriott member. I thought that I had found a new favorite but this experience leaves me irritated a day later. When I park at the airport, I can be off the property and on the road in a half hour. Last night, with a flight arrival time of 2230, we were finally on the highway at 0020. This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. Needless to say, I will be calling the GM at the hotel and possibly corporate later this week.Good Morning DLogsdon,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I apologize about the experience you had with the airport shuttles during your stay. I will make sure to share your comments with the appropriate staff. It is hard to say what exactly occurred during the time you were waiting for our shuttle at the airport and various things such as traffic, as well as trying to accommodate all of our guest could effect the exact time of arrival at the airport. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you,
The hotel is all suites, so each room has plenty of space. The access to the airport train makes this very convenient, and the airport shuttle will drop you off at the transit station if you can't make the walk of 4 blocks.
This property is a very typical Marriott with capable staff (aside from housekeeping) and nicely finished interiors. I have stayed here twice within a month and both experiences were pleasant, especially their marketing director (Peggy, I believe her name was) whom I met in the lobby. She went out of her way to find information for my colleagues and I to make our visit exceptional. However, housekeeping staff requires some further training on how and when to enter a room. Apparently my Do Not Disturb sign had fallen out of the card reader. At 8 am sharp while I was still soundly asleep I awoke to a scratching sound at the door, followed by her abrupt attempt at entry. She was unable to get in because of the metal flap safety device, and yelled. I asked her to come back later (preferably, after I checked out an hour later) and received a snotty sigh of disgust in return. Slleping in one's paid hotel room is not too much to ask.
The best part of our visit was dealing with Tim at the front desk. Our travel agent had screwed up our reservation and Tim took care of us like a pro. There were 3 of us traveling together and we had three rooms, every time we needed something we knew Tim was the person to see. He greeted us each time with a smile and we left the desk each time feeling we were the most important guests at his hotel. Great job, Tim, we wish all hotels had a Tim at their front desk.
The hotel is quite close to the airport and offers free shuttle which is very convenient. In spite of proximity noise is rarely a bother. Bedrooms have a decent size and so do the bathrooms and housekeeping do their job quite thoroughly. Toiletries are nice, no showercap so bring yours if so needed. Towels very good quality. Mattress comfortable and so are pillows. Complementary good quality coffee and tea (would love some cookies).Staff is super friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.The place is quite far from city at some 35USD in regular taxi and about half with Uber. There's a nice outlet close by and the blue line is relatively close. However, this is not a convenient place if you are visiting Chicago as will take you a while to get there, is great though for conventions and similar events. Has parking places but you may want to check price beforehand.Wifi great and tech support simply too good to be true. The restaurant has great options and both wine and cocktails selections very good but perhaps a bit pricey.If they also had shuttles for the city would be paradise. In any case highly recommendable for the kind of situations described above.
Unfortunately was a somewhat terrible stay. Right from the get go was warned that the systems were down and would have them up again soon. Was told about other amenities and directed to the room. Come to find out walking by the pool that that was out of order as well. With no wifi since their systems were down I headed to the bar and got a bite a drink. I think everyone was there since no one could get wifi or go to the pool and everyone charging their rooms. The next day at our tradeshow event the wifi was still in and out and their systems were still down. Overall pretty disappointing experience with all of the amenities unavailable. Hopefully they figure it out!Thank you for your feedback, and we apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. Unfortunately, Marriott did have a system outage caused by the hurricane that affected several hundred properties during your stay. We worked very quickly to resolve the issue, though, and our system was back up in less than 24 hours. We truly value your business and hope that you'll give us another try in the future. Thank you for choosing Marriott!
Stayed 2 nights for a conference. This hotel is very close to the airport. I used Lyft to get there and it took 9 minutes in morning traffic. The CTA blue line Cumberland stop is literally in their parking lot and I used it to get back to the airport. I also took it downtown to sightsee one night- was about a 35 minute ride to be dropped off right in the heart of the city by the riverwalk and magnificent mile. I was able to check in using the app at 9:00 and by lunchtime I had a room key and could grab a quick nap. Using the app I requested a shaving kit (an option listed as available) and a refrigerator which the website lists as available upon request. I received a chat message that a fridge was on the way up to the room and would be placed in the room. I left to sightsee and returned 7 hours later with a bottle of wine and left overs expecting to have somewhere appropriate to store them. There was no fridge or shaving kit in the room. I wouldn't mind but when they offer to provide me with anything I forgot (how do you fly with a razor nowadays anyhow) and tell me that something is on its way, then I expect it to be there. If they had replied that either were unavailable it wouldn't have been a big deal. Conference services were okay. Meeting rooms were comfortable temperatures. Food wasn't great but I passed other meetings with amazing looking food so I feel like my organization just picked the cheapest option. The grilled vegetable sandwich boxed lunch I was provided was quite good. No where around in walking distance for toiletries or food. Grub Hub was limited to a Denny's, several Mexican restaurants and a subway. Pretty much forced to travel to eat or eat at the hotel restaurant which is okay but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't probably stay here unless it was required for a conference or the location being by public transportation. Thank you for your review. As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay. We apologize for the shaving kit and refrigerator issue you experienced. It has been addressed with our housekeeping team. Thank you for staying with us, and we hope to see you the next time you're in Chicago.
The hotel is nice the view is ok near to the hotel there is a big grocery store and train station also it is near to the airport so easily access to everything around you they provide a shuttle to fashion outlet Chicago all what you need is in the room and it is big clean and tidy
Ive stayed at this hotel a few times and find it to be a solid choice for an overnight stay before an early flight departure. Check in was quick and efficient, and the rooms are comfortable. This was my first stay that included lounge access, and I found it to be very disappointing and sparse. I arrived 25 minutes before it switched to dessert, and was left with a few pieces of cheese and a couple of smashed crackers. I did try the bite desserts which were pretty good. No complimentary beer or wine.Thank you for your feedback about the concierge lounge. We have addressed the issues you experienced with our Food Beverage team. We hope you'll give us another try in the future, and thank you for staying with us.
Only reason not to give the hotel a 5 star rating is the fact you have to pay to park and for internet. Rarely do I ever pay for these items at other hotels across the country. Parking is understandable, however paying for internet combined with a higher than average parking fee especially compared to hotels on the same block that charge nothing for either is a major turn off. Otherwise a fantastic hotel with great service. Still some renovation work happening as of today May 8 however it didn't cause any problems and was not intrusive. Overall another great stay.
5 minutes from Ohare and with a shuttle running every 30 minutes to and from the hotel. This is a nice property for a quick lay over. My room was very clean and staff very hospitable. Concierge level on 11th floor was stocked well and the food provided in the mornings and evenings was top drawer. Not much close to this property. Very nice grocery store about a block from the hotel is within easy walking distance with prepared food and good grocery selection.
I can tell you I travel a lot and when I travel and I need help I am a friend indeed. The people at the front desk were phenomenal. Not only were they extremely friendly, they really made me feel like an old buddy! Just to say I had to write a review they were so accommodating to all my business needs. Beautiful Hotel with great restaurant will be back. Rooms very nice!
When checking into a 300+ a night room I expect my bags to be brought to my room. I do not expect to be told to go through the restaurant and meander about until you see elevators. On my meander I did notice a pool which seemed indoor/outdoor and would have possibly been enticing were I not carrying my own luggage and trying to follow the directions given by desk clerk. The room itself was small, but quite clean. There was nothing wrong with it, nor was there anything special. My son enjoyed his room service meal of ribs. Two glasses of Pinot Grigio arrived as Chardonnay with no explanation. Check out was simple, airport shuttle thankfully was beyond efficient, I believe the driver Hector (I believe. It definitely started with a H) was completely aces. Obviously there are better places to stay in Chicago, but I needed something near airport bc of a missed connection. This did the job of clean bed and shower, decent late evening dinner, got us to airport on time. It accomplished these with no charm or warmth which I don't need, but would have relished at the late hour and exhausting day I'd had.Dear Betsy B. Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay with us. We appreciate the positive and not so positive feedback you have for us. We hope that you will find time to return with your son to enjoy the pool and that we have to opportunity to serve you again - with Marriott's well know service! Wishing you safe travels and a fantastic summer! Dieter Heigl
Thanks to American Airlines I found myself stranded in the Windy City for one night. First a faulty door, then poor weather and then returning to the gate to refuel (surely they should have thought about that one). Either way I wasn't going home, but heading straight for the Marriott O'Hare in Chicago, which, while on one level, not a great thing, on another, it meant I could mooch around Chicago for the day, which I did.The Marriott O'Hare was very much in the corporate mould, the sort of place where I find air hostesses normally Asian checking in ahead of me and sure enough there they were, but the check-in procedure was remarkably smooth and helpful. However, finding the room and then finding my way from the room back to the front desk area was tricky at one stage I was lost in a maze of corridors and had to retrace my steps back to the room and then start again, taking a right turn instead of a left. But this was a minor problem in the scheme of things.The hotel room was very nice. Too many pillows on the bed, but then all Marriotts seem to suffer from that affliction. There was WiFi, but it wasn't free which I always find a diabolical liberty and, oddly, it's always the big chain hotels that request payment, the ones that, arguably, don't need the money. Smaller hotels seem to offer it for free and, let's face it, the Marriott could too, but it chooses to charge. It was all academic to me as the airline had checked in my bag, which contained my laptop, so I only had the business centre on the ground floor, which I would use the following day. In fact, on the subject of the business centre, it was fine and they allowed me to use it AFTER I had checked out, which was kind of them, so I did get my free WiFi after all. Extend free internet access to the rooms and you'd get a 'very good' rating from me.It was late or getting late by the time I reached the lobby and took a seat for dinner, although only a limited menu was available to me. I ordered a glass of Cabernet and the fish dish and it was fine. Breakfast the following morning was excellent they had everything and it was all top quality. I ordered fresh fruit and some bread plus a bowl of cereal (something like Alpen) along with a pot of tea. But once again, where the tea was concerned, I remembered that if I fancied a decent cuppa I would have to wait until I reached England. There's never a pot of tea in the USA, but there's more likely to be a pot of hot water and a teabag in a sachet and that was the offering at the Marriott. But again, not a major worry.There was a shuttle bus to the airport and, after mooching around Chicago (definitely not my kinda town) I'd driven back to the Marriott in a taxi (having taken the CTA into downtown from Cumberland, a station across the parking lot from the hotel) and sat at the bar with a glass of Cabernet awaiting the call from the shuttle driver. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes and takes about 20 minutes to reach the airport.I'm one of those people who tend not to like the corporate hotels, but then, everytime I find myself in a Marriott or a Hyatt, I have nothing but praise for them perhaps I do like corporate hotels and that 'brand reassurance' they offer. I could have done with another night at the Marriott O'Hare and, preferably, under calmer circumstances. Marriotts are good hotels. I liked the Cleveland Marriott and the one in Atlanta and I'll forgive them leaving too many pillows on the beds. Keep up the good work.Mr. Moggridge! Thank you for writing about your stay! I thoroughly enjoyed your writing and thank you for the positive comments. As well as noting what we could improve on. I hope this note finds you at your destination. Wishing you safe travels and a pleasant summer. Dieter Heigl
My wife and I stayed here with a group of friends this past weekend and we could not be happier. The front desk made us feel very welcome, and gave great directions to restaurants and bars. The front desk said they had 3 weddings going on that night so they told us they would put us on a high floor far away from all that noise, this was very much appreciated. Our room was located on the 10th floor and faced west. The room was huge and extremely clean. The bathroom was clean and looked new. The upper floors 10, 11 and 12 are private floors that you need your room key to access, this is a nice feature. I would highly recommend this hotel.Dear Jim T. Thank you very much for taking the time to write about your stay. We are thrilled that you and your wife enjoyed your time with us. We look forward to welcoming you back some time in the future. Wishing you safe travels. Thank you. Dieter Heigl
We loved this hotel. Our room had a private bedroom and was huge. The restaurant attached - cant recall the name was great too. Omelette bar in the morning and one of the best steaks Ive had for dinner - please get the Marriott butter...More
I have to be honest that from the outside, the hotel seemed a little scary and outdated. Once inside, however, it was one of the most modern Marriott locations I've stayed in. The lobby area was welcoming and there were plenty of areas to hang out with colleagues in the evening. And the rooms were equally modern and larger than average. My only complaint was that the bathroom was extremely small. I highly recommend this location for small business conferences given its proximity to the airport. The shuttle came in very handy for conference attendees.Dear BFR1920, thank you for taking the time to write your experience while staying with us. We appreciate your comments and hopefully will see you again soon. Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
Had a short overnight stay here. It's a challenge to find the shuttle stop at the airport- it's at door 2 of the bus center. After that it's a 15 minute ride to the hotel.Staff are friendly and the breakfast was good. Concierge Lounge was closed at the weekend so I got a voucher. Beds are comfortable and hotel is not too noisy for an airport hotel. Blue line train to downtown is right next to the hotel.
This Marriott was selected for me as part of our partner meeting. After flying in from Miami, having a shuttle to get us to the hotel was a nice touch. Although some complained that it took too long for the shuttle to arrive and get them to the hotel. That was not my experience. Within five minutes of arriving at the shuttle stop, we were on our way with a very friendly and polite shuttle driver named Joseph. Upon arrival, and before checking in I had an excellent meal at the Brickton Grill located in the lobby with my partners. Upon checking in, I found a room that's a bit on the small size but definitely functional, clean, and comfortable. There were plenty of outlets to charge my electronic devices, plenty of drawer space and closet space to unpack, and the desk was perfect for work. The workstation and office chair important to me and my business travels. I thought that the Matt did a great job with the room. The bed was very comfortable. I will also note that the service on all levels was very good. The location in Rosemont not very far from the airport makes this an excellent place to stay on business if you don't need to be in downtown Chicago.Dear Maltafaz: Thank you very much for writing a review of visit with us. I glad that you enjoyed your stay as well as your dining experience in Brickton and Brickton Bar. We look forward to your next stay! Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
My wife and I were on a trip and we had a long layover. This is a very large airport. We had a airport employee help us find our way around to catch a shuttle to our hotel. Once we arrived at the hotel everything went smoothly. We had a very nice quiet room. we had a meal in the hotel restaurant which was pleasant.This hotel is a excellent place to stay if you have a flight layover in Chicago.
I had called from the airport to ensure that a refrigerator was in my room upon arrival. I was assured that one would be installed. I got to my room at 1:00am and no frig....one was delivered at 2 am.Upon checking in I gave details as to how I needed the bill split between me and my roommate who was arriving the next day. I gave the front desk my roommate's name as I wasn't going to be around whenshe arrived.When my roommate arrived the front desk said that they were not aware of her arrival.Upon checking out the bill wasnot split like I was ensured it would be.When I booked the room I requested a 1 pm. checkout versus 12 noon. I was assured that as an Elite member it wouldn't be a problem. I also confirmed an extended checkout time when checking in and the front desk assured me that I was all set.On day of check out I was told that I could not have a 1 hour extension.And last but not least I had requested the room cleaned before 2 pm... I was told that housekeepingwas being sent right up... that was at 11 am. Apparently they took a wrong turn as they didn't show up until 6 pm.All in all it was not a typicalMarriott experienceThank you for your feedback, and we apologize for the issues you experienced. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly if you'd like to discuss your experience further, and thank you for staying with us.
I joined a friend to attend a wonderful dollhouse miniature show this past weekend here in the Chicago Marriott O'Hare. Being very much a budget traveller when I travel alone, I figured sharing the cost of the room wouldn't be too much more than my budget hotels in Europe. Our room had a special rate because of the show but the 142 became became 191.52 with 2 nights parking and the normal taxes on both room and parking. My friends share would be slightly less - 164.80 because of the no parking fee.So, first of all, I thought paying for parking was sort of unfriendly. It wasn't like it was an enclosed lot or anything - just parking out in front of the hotel like most any other hotels I've stayed in in the states. And aside from its humungous and very nicely decorated lobby with seating galore for visiting, I didn't find anything really special abut the hotel. We had two beds with very noisy sheets (sort of like sleeping under paper coverings), no fridge(!), had to pay for Wi-fi for each day. Fortunately I had a personal hotspot that we used and when I called this morning to make sure that guests really had to pay for wi-fi in their rooms (another guest had told us no, they put it on your bill but take it off when you check out) and I mentioned being glad I had a personal hotspot and she said oh, you have to pay for that too. I said I wasn't billed for it and she looked up our bills and said that neither was my friend. I asked if I should advise TA readers that they can use their personal hotspots and she said no, because they'll be billed. So take your pick on that one. I, for one, couldn't believe there was no wi-fi and fridge in the rooms. Most of the hotels I stay in in the states are lower down the ladder - Best Western, Days Inn, etc., and I always have Wi-fi and very often have a fridge. And then there were just little things, we had a one-cup-at a time coffee maker in the room for which they provided 4 packets of coffee and 2 tea bags, one black tea, the other chamomile. And...the little cup that would hold the coffee grounds was missing. We both drank tea so just poured the water in to heat and let it drip out into our cups but I had to get extra tea bags because we both drink black. Our first night there, I couldn't get the bedside phone to work - have no idea why because the desk phone worked and they both worked after that first night.So, I guess I'm saying our stay was basically okay but if you want to keep anything cold, forget that and if you don't have a personal hotspot (or don't want to take a chance on getting billed for using it), you'll have to go down to the lobby for wi-fi where it's free but sometimes just has two bars although I noticed in the evenings it seems to be higher. Thank you for your feedback, and we're sorry to hear you weren't completely satisfied with your stay. The phone issue you experienced will certainly be addressed. As to the parking fee, all hotels in the area charge for parking, due to our proximity to O'Hare. We also offer complimentary internet to all Rewards members who book directly through Marriott, and we have complimentary fridges available upon request. We apologize if the internet policy was not properly communicated, and please don't hesitate to contact us directly if you'd like to discuss your experience. We're glad to hear you enjoyed the miniatures show, and we hope to see you again next time.
The hotel has been thoroughly modernized and is great and very fresh. The size of the rooms and bathrooms in the main hotel is great. We did not stay in the of the rooms out by the pool. There was a slight issue when checking in as we called in the morning and requested connecting rooms as we had a 3 adults and 2 four year olds and a two and a half year old. When we checked in we were taken to the 9th floor first and no connection then to the 10th floor and no connection and then down to the 3rd floor and found connecting there. Kyle the bell hop was great and stayed with us on the radio so we did not have to travel up and down with cart and kids. They handled it well and resolved it quickly. Kyle did an excellent job of taking care of us. The only thing I would say is questionable is the pool area in the indoor area floor. The floor is very slippery and dangerous and we were quite surprised when we were there that the hotel has not done something to change that after all the money they spent on the remodel.Also had a bit of trouble everytime we left parking lot with room keys and the parking kiosk. Took several times and a buzz to the inside to get the gate up. We were not the only ones, everyone we came across was having trouble exiting the hotel parking lot. Maybe they should come up with a new system. Laundry area was nice and very clean and bright. They may want to considering adding one more of each machine as they have only one now, but it was a large room with plenty of space and very clean. The restaurant breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff in the restaurant and bar area were very good.The business center was great with new computers and a great printer. Would definitely stay again.
The Hotel was fantastic. We had a King Suite and it was a great room. The service was incredible, friendly and everyone there went the extra mile to insure your satisfaction. Rosemont has every great restaurant that Chicago has- Mortons, Gibson's, Capital Grill, Hugo Frog Bar, Bub City, McCormick Scmick's, Harry Carrey's and dozens more. They also have a Casino, Outlet Mall, Indoor Skydiving, Theatres ( Movie and Live performance, The Rosemont Horizon, Joe's ( on Weed). You will never be bored.
This hotel is very close to the office we were holding our meeting. I was on the 8th floor, about four rooms off the elevators and it was fairly quiet. Nice, comfy beds and decor. I had a walk-in shower that was nice. The concierge level suite was good which I visited during hors d'eorves hour before our 7:30pm dinner reservations and also again in the morning for breakfast. There was an excellant spread available with many juice options. I particularily enjoyed that the lamps wall sockets in the room had USB ports to charge your phone/Kindle etc. The cost of the room seemed pretty steep, but I enjoyed my stay overall. Shuttle service from O'Hare was prompt and I think comes every 20 minutes.
hotel is very near to airport also provides shuttle service. Rooms looks great ...but little congested. You will have many options to choose from breakfast...and few good restro's are nearby. You may choose this to be near to airport.......and little far away from downtown.
I have been staying at this Marriott Hotel almost yearly for the past 34 years and it has always evolved to keep up with the needs of it's clientele. Currently, it is a very good meeting site for large and small conferences or special events such as weddings. The rooms have been upgraded, not luxurious but functional with down comforters. The price is very reasonable for all of the amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, jacuzzi, exercise room, bar, restaurant, concierge, proximity to the rapid transit station, restaurants and to O'Hare Int'l airport. There is a courtesy shuttle that will pick up and drop off at the airport. Overall, unless I need to be in the city, this is my go to place for Chicago.
We stayed at this hotel as a stop over point on our family vacation to Door County Wisconsin. The hotel was easy to find and our front desk check-in process was quick and easy. The staff is very friendly and helpful! We booked with a package from Marriot that included parking and a 3 day transit pass. If you plan to go downtown it is a little bit of a long train ride but much easier than driving there! The rooms were clean and comfortable. They are a little small but you never feel cramped. The pool area is beautiful and room was on the ground floor with direct access. I would highly reccomend this hotel for pleasure or business!
We've stayed here before due to its central location. On this multi-day visit we learned that a franchisee was assuming control and that had many of the staff very concerned, and they were vocal about this. It seemed to be a terrible communication issue with the staff, which is disappointing because we think they have a good team presently.
My wife and I arrived the hotel at about 10am. It was too early to checkin so we left the luggage and a box of food in hotel. The bell boy was nice and helpful. We went back hotel about 10pm. The room was ready though not upgraded. We were so tried and soon fell asleep. The next morning I tried to get into the lounge on top floor but the room key just doesn't work. I was thinking that my Gold elite might not have the perks for the reward night so we decided to find our breakfast in airport. I asked the front desk about the rule of lounge access. I was told that I should have access but somehow the key wasn't function properly so he asked the restaurant to pack two cups of chicken noodle soup for us. That was so warm in the windy city. Am I too easy going lol
Very close to the Airport, they have blue line to the downtown Chicago for 50mins from the hotel, the best way to the Downtown Chicago is taking the blue no driving no taxi cuz the heavy traffics!I don't recommend this Marriott for stay during the weekend cuz they closed the lounge from Friday morning to Sunday! Same as the Renaissance across the freeway!services---bad!!!Recommend to stay with another hotel!Dear Edision C,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. Our Concierge lounge is closed on weekends. We're sorry if this caused any inconvenience to you during your stay. We do offer all Platinum and Gold members a choice between breakfast for two or a 750 bonus point credit for this inconvenience. Please reach out to us directly if there is anything else we may assist you with. Wishing you safe travels!
My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights (Fri to Sun). We checked in around 9 PM and the staff was very cordial. After entering the room we realized that during the time of booking, we did not specify the type of room we want and hence ended up getting one with two Queen beds. My wife called the front desk and asked if we can get a King Bed. They accommodated us immediately and a staff member brought the new room keys to us. This was great since we did not have to go back to the front desk.The room:- The room was modest in size with a balcony and chairs to sit- South wing rooms had a great view of the indoor+outdoor pool while the North wing rooms had a view of some concrete ground and a covered up swimming pool- Air conditioning was working well and the hot water was consistent- We did not like the bed that much as we had minor back pain every morning. Fortunately it was not that bad.Food:We ate in the hotel restaurant only once. We had a breakfast of French Toast and pancakes. The food was decent and the price reasonable. The bar had about a dozen beers on the tap. Moose Drool was my favorite.Service:Throughout our stay, the service was excellent. Every staff member was professional, yet friendly and very helpful.Here are some of the additional expenses you may want to consider.Parking: 28 per dayBasic Internet: 13 per dayHigh speed Internet: 17 per dayDear Bhaskar, thank you very much for taking the time to write about your stay with us. I am very happpy to hear that you and your wife enjoyed your time and our hotel! Perhaps we can welcome you again some time in the future! Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
My family and I stayed at the Chicago Marroitt O'hare from July 10th-12th to attend the Chicago tastefest of 2015. My family (4 adults) and I arrived at the hotel at around 4pm to check in (check in was said to be 3pm) not knowing it was same weekend the college referees we having a convention there thus the check in process was horrible. I booked a room with two queen beds and was told it was a guarantee. Thus after waiting 1 hour to finish the check in process I was told my room was no longer available that my family and I (3 other adults) would only be given a room with a king bed (unacceptable). Finally when I demanded to speak with a manager things turned around. I would have given this hotel 5 stars for the great location, the upgrades, and quality of the rooms except the front desk staff ruined that.
I can't say enough about my stay at the hotel. The staff was wonderful. Room was extremely comfortable. Loved the convenience of the walkover to AMA where I had business. Close to subway for touring downtown. The only thing that bugged me was that wifi was not free - I just don't get that these days. I did not eat in the hotel or go to the bar so I can't speak to those.
This property has recently undergone renovations and it shows - the lobby area was amazing. Check-in was prompt and courteous and despite what other reviews may indicate the shuttle to and from the airport was hassle free and not overly time consuming, 15 mins at most. We dined at the restaurant and the food and service was exceptional and not overly priced for an airport hotel. The room was comfortable and quiet and the in-room coffee is always appreciated. The fitness facilites were clean and provided anything you may have forgotten offered more than a few treadmills and ellipticals like most hotels - provided both free weights and machines. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Overall would recommend this hotel and will add it to our list should we ever be in need near O'Hare again.Dear thejohnsons556,Thank you so much for your kind words. We appreciate you taking the time to write a post about our hotel. We are delighted you enjoyed your past stay and we look forward to the opportunity to have you back again soon. Happy New Year and safe travels.
I stayed here for a business conference. Everything was very good. Great location. I received wifi with the rate paid. Great food. Check in was easy. Parking convenient. My biggest complaint is that the pool was drained. Since I was traveling with my children they were highly disappointed. However, they were able to visit Legoland and visit the town.For business it was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They allowed a later checkout to accommodate the conference schedule.
Very nice updates to this Marriott.The restaurant and lobby area is very nice. Lobby can be loud at night with everyone enjoying happy hour.The gym is very nice, but a little tricky to find in the pool area.Concierge lounge is nice, but tiny. Great food and service.We had a meeting here, and they did everything they could to accommodate us and our needs. I asked for a Diet Sierra Mist, and they brought me 4 of them in a bowl with ice, and a glass with ice.My only complaint would be the shuttle ride to and from the airport. Its is long, and makes many stops, including to the Marriott O'Hare Suites. If time is on your side, or you are totally cheap, take the shuttle. However, if you want to get into your bed and be to sleep as soon as possible, take a cab. It runs between 16-20 bucks.Dear sttcarrie:Thank you very much for spending the time to write about your stay and your very positive experience with your meeting. Indeed the travel time to the hotels in the area is lenghty at times, the airport restrict all shuttle pick up to only the bus center in terminal two which creates traffic jams at times. We do run our shuttles every 20 minutes throughout the day and make every effort to be on time. Thank you again for staying with Marriott!Wishing you happy holidays and safe travels.
Stayed here one night for business. I travel under government processes for projects, and unfortunately I forgot my government ID. I am never asked by Marriottt (as a gold) for my ID...but here I was asked, and because I forgot my ID, I ended up paying the last minute rack rate. I was not happy. Often i can get my office to email me something, but as would happen, the person who has a copy of my ID, was not in the office by the time I checked in..... so I am forced to pay out of my pocket the difference.... while the guy checking me in was trying to be nice about it, he insisted on the higher rate (after 30 years, this has NEVER happened, tho' I have been asked for my ID 2 times in 30 years as usually my profile is used). Since I am liable for my badge if I loose it, I don't travel with it. In addition the rate for parking is over 20 per nite (self parking where one has to walk in the snow/ice to park and retrieve their car)...... While I know that they are just enforcing a policy, I am a gold and have an established Marriot profile..... I will try to reduce the charge when I get back home, but I was really unhappy with this treatment.Hotel room was the smallest I have stayed outside many Manhattan hotels (however, even the Marriott Marquis in Times Square is 3 times bigger than this hotel). Attached is a copy of the bathroom photo that shows you have to step around the toilet to close the bathroom door.... unbelievably small. Room was marginally clean, as I found an empty water bottles in the room from the prior occupant, something sticky on the desk, and had to use my white noise machine for to sleep given the person next door who either had a guest or was on the phone talking rather loudly (tho' thin walls happens at many hotels).As you enter hotel, reception desk is on the left and there appears to be a large bar. You have to use a room key in the elevator to go to your floor and any permitted floor. The hallways are decorated with an attempt at stylish. Bed is very comfortable, which is why the three bubble rating.This hotel is about the same distance to the FAA offices on Devon, but next door to one of the airport contractor offices which is why I decided to re-try it...... I come to Chicago monthly, and this is the first time in a very long time I have stayed in this hotel. Normally I am at the Westin in River Road or the ORD Hyatt. Given the difficulty with the rate.... doubt I will be back here and have already booked the Westin for my next stay.Dear Mary V.: I am very sorry that you did not have the proper ID for the preferred room rate you booked and your stay with us did not meet your expectations. We already reviewed your suggestions with the entire team. Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay. Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
I would never stay here again. The food at the basic breakfast buffet was good and the front desk was nice BUT the rooms were terrible. We were notPut in the tower but in the low rise Motel 6 type section. Bathroom was extremely small. (Door will hit your knee and you can touch the ceiling with the palm of your hand). Our rooms overlooked the pool and their was a connecting balcony along the outside of all rooms overlong pool. Did not like that feature or the bright lights kept on all balconies thru the night and the curtains poor design allowed for a lot of light tocome into the room. Sheets were too small for the bed and didn't even cover the mattress. Carpet on stairs to our floor was years past its replacement date. Walls thin. I could hear hairdryers etc in next room, kids having fun in the pool and planes from O'Hare at night. It was NOT a peaceful stay. For the cost of a Marriott stay you get a Motel 6 kinda roomDear Wendy Z,Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write to us about your most recent stay. We value your constructive criticism, without your feedback we would not be able to learn and grow in our quest for excellence in guest service. We hope that if you find yourself in the area again you'll give us a chance to make it up to you. Wishing you safe travels!
We booked this hotel as we are Marriott Rewards guests needed 9 nights of parking while down in the carribean. Our son daughter in law met us at the airport, so shared the room. We had a nice dinner drinks in the restaurant before retiring for the night. Our flight was at 5:30am, so made arrangements for the shuttle at 4am, which worked out well! Upon returning we did have difficulty with our parking ticket getting out of the parking lot...Parking is not in a covered, so had to clear our car of a little snow. Overall, a very nice experience!Dear Karen B - Thank you for being a loyal Chicago Marriott O'Hare guest. I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your most recent stay with us. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Safe travels.
My family was headed south to Florida and had a reservation here as our halfway destination. I had made my reservations online, but realized afterwards that I had chosen the incorrect date. I called the hotel directly, and they switched our reservations without difficulty. When we checked in, however, the original rate from my first reservation had changed and increased... More
The hotel is very rundown. I was very disappointed. The mattresses were terrible you could feel Springs
We booked 2 rooms because of the excellent price. We have always been huge fans of Microtel hotels, but this one disappointed greatly. In one room (306) there was: A gaping hole in the shower curtain causing the floor to flood Cabinet that would not close Gooey stickiness smeared on top of fridge Window screen hanging loose Lightbulbs out Sink...

Went for a short trip to Orlando, hotel was great, had a pool side room, clean room, good job housekeeping, staff were great
OK, I am a budget traveler so I am not expecting a luxurious room. I cannot understand all the horrible reviews given to this place. I've stayed around the world in many small, dingy rooms, but I have never had a room that I couldn't stay in. After all, if you're in Orlando for a hotel room, maybe you should just stay home--you hardly spend any time in the room anyway. But for 28 a night, this was an incredible bargain. The room was very clean. The door keys take a special touch, but once you figure it out, it worked every time. The desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. The cleaning staff did a great job every day...and worked around all of my girls' stuffed animals. We stayed here 6 nights with my family of 4 and couldn't have asked for a better place at this rate. The location is great--lots of restaurants, close to I-4, close to Sea World. The pool is beautiful (the weather was just a little too cold for us to enjoy the pool). Maybe it's not the most exotic place and could use a few touch-ups...but for this price in Orlando it's wonderful. If you're expecting a fancy room, this is not the place for you, but if you like a great deal, I would highly recommend it.
Comfortable bed, hotel needs makeover. Didn't notice the NO CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST when making the reservation. I've never been to a Days Inn that didn't have it, though. What a surprise in the morning. Two bad small coffees, two bagels and two tubes of cream cheese, about 7. I could have stayed in a better place and had breakfast for free.
It had great location and price but rooms were out dated cable was horrible no channels fuzzy couldn't hook up fire stick
Rooms and facilities are ok for such a low price range but what stands out is excellent service and amazingly pleasant and accommodating staff! I really felt service was better than at many 5 star hotels. I was reluctant to ask receptionist Amy to book me Mears shuttle not sure if such service can be expected for a low budget hotel. Not only did she do it happily she said she will follow it up. When I went to reception hour early and asked if all ok she said sure and showed me her reminder to follow it up. Amy Really took care of me and I am grateful for this. Alexandra at coffee shop is so sweet and pleasant you get a feeling she is an old friend. And coffee shop stocks all the basics a guest may need for personal hygene as well as food. Location is great!!! Near outlets, 3 minute walk to wet and wild, plenty of dinning options. Very grateful for staying here.
box spring look like it had better days and the mattress had a dip in the middle so when two people laid on it we ended up rolling to the middle of the bed. bathroom door was in bad shapeand the room had an old musty smellthank god I only needed it to sleep and it was only one night
This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever had the misfortune of checking into. I had come to Orlando to meet with my sister who was flying in from the UK, she and I had not seen each other in 3 years and it was to be a great vacation with each other. Checked in, and 30 minutes later checked out. This hotel had cockroaches, the room we were given was filthy, a visiting prostitute went to the room next door whilst we stood and watched. 3 attempts to gain entry to our room resulted in the handy man coming with master key. And to add insult to injury the dirt and grime was so thick it made me ill. There was one wash cloth, one hand towel, and 2 bath towels. The toilet seat was cracked, and it was supposed to have been a disabled access room. I could not enter the bathroom in my wheelchair. I have reported the hotel both to the Wyndham group, and also to hotel licensing of Orange county Orlando. This place needs condemning.
Just for sleep its ok, good location, big room, clean, but smells not good, old room, excellent and nice services with chek in and chek out, for this price its ok, near malls and some attractions. have a service to buy tickets for all parks
Toilet got clogged the first day, we got help on next morning. Imagine what the family of four with two little kids will go through. The intercom is not working, the best no buttons in the intercom. All buttons are broken. Ice in the cake, sleep with cockroaches!! Our vacation screwed
Rioms were nasty nothing work properly. Out dated television, no refrigerator nor microwave in rooms then everyday rates goes up, as if thier offerring something for the amount of money veing spent. Didnt appreciate the false customers services front mgmt. He would make promises that he didn't keep. Very unhappy with my stay then he the mgmt would treat you like a dog. Didnt earn not one singke free stay after staying straight for 14days abd paid over 700. Too much extra from hotel and Wyndham rewards very misleading.
The most miserable dump I've ever had the misfortune to step into in my entire life. Let me tell you why. Spoiler: It ends with this being a mold dump. The paint on the door is peeling. Door opens and we're slammed with a wave of moldy smell that's mean as hell and thick as grass. We're dead tired and we assume that maybe we just need to run the AC or maybe we just need to leave the door open for a bit. (The door needs to be shoved closed by the way.) The light in the bathroom buzzes like a chain saw and a quick shower ends with stained towels. Or maybe they were just dirty. Early wake up the next day and we come back to the same rancid smell. I investigate and realize there is clear water damage everywhere!!! Bu the door, in the bathroom, all over the ceiling. Thrown in damaged furniture and a sink that's falling apart and you really have an A+ dump. All this on top of a real health hazard. We checked out and went somewhere else at like 11 PM.
Nice city hotel with adequate facilities. Nice rooms with hot water bath, aircon cable TV, and Self Laundry Service foc. Nice and friendly staff Swimming pool. Located centrally near shopping malls like Premiere Mall, Millenium Mall, Florida Mall Ross etc. Wet Wild Water Theme Park was right next door. Universal Studios was just 5 mins drive. Value for money. Would recommend for any tourist with an average budget for a Comfy stay and easy access to many attractions.
This hotel was beyond disgusting. The walls and ceiling were covered in mold and crumbling, there were gaping holes in the walls behind the fixtures, the bathtub was clogged and the faucet dripped. There were roaches crawling on the floors and walls in the bathroom. I will NEVER stay in a Days Inn ever again. The photos on line when I booked were very deceiving!
Pros: can't say enough about the location. walking distance to restaurants, convenience stores and pharmacy. Minutes like 5 minutes top to universal. 6 minutes to the giant ferris wheel. Stayed here before and can say they have started some renovations that were much needed. Check in was easy and check out as well. Water pressure was amazing. If you are here for the parks and not be in the hotel much it would be perfect match. Cons: rooms are not noise proof. TV was out dated. more repairs are needed. It's improved but needs more done. The motel can not help how other guest act but I cold see they were monitoring a couple in a huge fight that everyone could here. I had my phone ready to call 911 if need be. No bar which was a bummer. The in house deli wasn't anything really. I decided to eat breakfast else where after that. With Denny's across the street and ihop in walking distance it was no biggie. I had an inside hallway near the pool it seemed a bit more quiet but felt isolated. If your in need of a budget friendly and aren't picky about things it would be a match. If you have kids its not bad and are on the conscience mind its perfect match. Most kids don't care as long as there is a pool.
The room smelt the bathroom was not very clean, there was stuff on the walls. The a.c. was broken so was a light fixture. The tv channels came in blurry and staticy. But the location was great
For starters, the reception staff treats the guestsas a potential thief... They ask a document to be signed by all guests with the price list of all the items in the room, including bulbs that will cost 25 usd or so each...Rooms at outdated, smelly and badly maintained.I would never stay in this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone either.
Location is the only thing this place has going for it. The door didn't seal, the curtains didn't cover the whole window, the towels were so threadbare you felt like you were using paper towels, and the power outlets were so loose my charger kept falling out. The staff was friendly enough when prompted but didn't go out of their way. I also had to pay a 50 deposit that has not been returned yet.
Looks very nice from the streets, but not a clean place to stay. Went to use the microwave in the lobby a guest was using it before me she standing in front of the microwave with the trash can throwing up in it, the microwave was dirty inside. The rooms are not up to par. Not a good stay for me.
We stayed for 2 nights and 2 nights was enough. We found one cockroach on the first night and one in the morning on the second day. There was dust all over the fixtures. Our sheets smelled off, not clean. I probably won't stay in a days inn again.
Had a very good experience here. All of the staff were very professional and helpful. Room was clean and everything worked. Great stay for the price.
This is the worst hotel I have EVER stayed in!!! The price was good, but a little too good to be true. They charge you not only for your stay but also a resort fee and if your room is not ready by the time you get there and you'd like to leave your luggage, they also charge you for that! The pictures on the website are extremely deceiving. The outside looks nice but the closer you get you can tell just from the outside of the building that your in for a trip. The staff was not that nice, rude actually. When my boyfriend and I had gone back to the lobby, the lady told me to hold on a second so she could finish her text messaging.......The room was disgusting. Neither of us could walk around without anything on our feet. The bathroom had a ton of cracks and was also 4 different colors. The shower did not drain well at all and when you close the bathroom door, the crack was so big between the door frame and the door, I could see the other room perfectly. The only reason why we continued our stay here was because every hotel was booked around us. We weren't in the room for a half hour yet and we were both on the phone trying to find another hotel.The pool was terrible, no lighting around it what so ever at night. Another guest had to switch their room 4 times due to the air conditioners not working in any of those rooms. Also, pizza flyers were VERY ANNOYING!!! 2am and you hear someone at your door, sounding like trying to break in, but just sliding the flyers under the door.DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Booked a room for a few nights. Got there late at night because of my flight. Went to check in and give my employee discount and they said they couldn't even though I called in advance to let them know. They told me there limit employee discounts and they can't do them. It's one or the other but I was like how can you limit an employee discount. So I cancelled and booked one night to let management know next morning. Got in my room and the first thing I noticed was it smelled like pose. My wife went to the bathroom and saw a dead smashed roach on the floor and a small one in the tub. They had no towels or rags in the bathroom as we would not use them anyway from what we were experiencing. We slept with our clothes on and checked out asap. I booked another hotel while staying the night there. Didn't care about the discount just wanted out of there. Didn't get any sleep as we took turns staying up to make sure no unwanted friends wanted to tag along.
Room was not safe. The door didn't close all the way. It was stuffy and gross. Walls were super thin and could hear everything going on around us. Was not notified that there was breakfast.
Room service was an added cost - never saw that before. Changes actual room rate, from what was advertised - deceptive. Shower controls not secured to wall. Toilet see not tightened down. One light had to be unplugged to turn off, because switch was missing. In general, facility maintenance appears to be absent.
Hi, I bought tickets from the internet as a package with this hotel without reading any reviews in the first place. howver later we did ) and we was yeah.. scared and even chocked about others reviews. We got in touch with the travelling agency and there was nothing to do, abosolutely nothing what so ever. Hmmm.. We searched the internet and found even 200 dollars per night with bad reviews, hmmm. We my wife and I agreed upon that we would show up on our already paid stay at Days Inn and we did)! We arrived and had two pool side rooms situated on the 1st. floor. We basically invented the rooms and searched the rooms for roaches and bugs as described in previous posts. We found it very nice, comfortable beds, Wifi which worked all our stay for 15 days ). The pool was also amazing clean and house keeping was effective every morning (Hard working latin americans.) I can only tell that I didn't expected such a good service and clean place - we were ready to leave directly, but we were surprised, really!! Great place and no danger for children, we had 3 kids with us on 17, 14 and 7 years old. Absolutely no problem, respectful environment and no dirt as claimed earlier. If this place was situated in Italy, people would expect this older style. I have seen worse places in europe where its accepted because of its location on a hill side etc.
VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!Wrong decision. The very same night we arrived I found 4 roaches in the bathroom. Horrible smell.!After 1 hour I was changed to another room with 1 roach.I was told the hotel was booked.Unsafe elevator, buttons missing, had to use the stairs. Old building, noisy A/C, leaking refrigerator, wet carpet.ROOM 546 544Be carefull before booking,
I've stayed at Days Inn's before in other cities and another location in Orlando, and although they are not the most luxurious hotel's around, they are adequate and easy places to stay - except this one!I just checked out this morning after being there 3 days. The main problem was with checking in. Several weeks before, I booked my stay on-line at their web site, choosing a pool-side room with 2 double-beds for a price I had to pre-pay for in advance. When I checked in, they gave me a room with 2 double-beds, but not pool-side. Instead they gave me a room on the top floor of their tower, which was literally the farthest room away from the front desk. When I said I reserved a pool-side room, I was told they didn't have any. When I showed them my reservation that I printed on my computer printer after I made the reservation on-line, the male clerk working that evening (the manager) said, That's not guaranteed. WHAT When I was making the reservation on-line, you are given about 12-15 different choices of rooms to choose from, depending on type and number of beds, amenities, etc. If a room isn't guaranteed, then why is a guest given all these choices to choose from Also, if the room is pre-paid for in advance, doesn't that lock in a guaranteeThis is just the first of all the domino's that began to fall when I was checking in. With my luggage, I walked up the 5 flight's of stairs to the room they gave me to find out the key wouldn't open the lock (magnetic key card). I walked back down first put my luggage back in the car before going back to the front desk telling them the key wouldn't open the door. They called for a Maintenance person to walk up with me to the room and he tried to open the door with his master key. It wouldn't unlock. He continued to try for about 3 minutes when it finally opened, then said to me There you go. But then I asked him if I go out tonight, I don't want to stand there for 3 minutes trying to open this door, at which he replied that he would be back in the morning to fix it. As he walked away, I entered the room and almost keeled-over from the smell in it. No kidding! It smelled as though someone had deficated human feces everywhere in the room. In addition, the lights were already on, the beds were unkept, and the TV was playing. I quickly ran out and yelled at the Maintenance guy to come back. When he entered the room, he looked surprised and went to the phone to apparently call the front-desk. At this point, I was livid! I stormed out of the room, ran down to the front desk, and in front of everyone in the lobby pointed at the male clerk behind the desk and sternly said, I want the pool-side room I reserved and I want it now! He yelled back We dont have any! I don't care for your attitude with me and I'll call the cops and have you thrown out for trespassing. Then you can sleep on the street tonight! At that, I said, Fine, and picked up my cell phone to call Days Inn's 800 number with the intention of getting someone of authority higher up than this guy to fix this situation. Possibly feeling threatened, the male clerk and a female clerk pulled out a large notebook and began looking frantically through it. When I reached a human voice on the Days Inn 800 line, the male clerk said he had a room on the 2nd floor with a king bed and asked if that would be OK with me. I told the person on the phone I may be calling back then hung up. I told the male clerk that I would look at it and let him know. He made up 2 keys, I went to look at the room, then returned to the front desk to tell him that it would be acceptable. After I settled into the room, I returned to the front desk and told the male clerk I was sorry for my outburst, but that I was within my right for it because of the problems that occured. I didn't catch every word the clerk said after that, but it sounded something like You don't know what's going on around here so there was no need to act like that, which told me there may be some sort of internal, political employee problems at this hotel - but that's still no excuse for the problems I enxcountered as a guest of this hotel.When I checked out this morning, the female clerk who took care of it asked me timidly Are you still mad at us She told me she was working the night I checked in and saw everything that happened. I answered her Yeah - a little bit, and she only said she hoped I would consider returning again sometime in the future. Maybe - if they gutted the place, did a complete remodeling job and hired all new, respondible hotel staff.
I was down there for the Cisco Live event in June. The reason I stayed there was because all the recommended hotels by Cisco were full, so this was my only choice.I checked in and was told the restaurant was closed for repairs, i accepted that, but when i got to my room and opened the door I had just realized my nightmare. The bathroom was filthy, the carpets were disgusting with stains and the room had the smell of Death in it. I knew someone else staying there, so I went to their room to see how it was and it was even worse!,,,,what a joke this place is. I tried to login into the wireless, it DID NOT WORK THE ENTIRE DURATION OF MY STAY. After the second night of sleeping in my clothes because of how disgusting the room was, I looked under my bed and low and behold A DEAD RAT.i jumped up, ran to the front desk and told them about it... They did not even look phased, worried or cared and without missing a beat she said all I can do is get you another room.... Please, unless you're from the ghetto and you want to stay somewhere that is rather inexpensive, then don't stay here it will ruin your entire experience... days inn as a company need to review this property, I'm not sure how they let this happen....
When we got there to check in, they made us pay a 50 deposit per room that they neglected to mention on the phone when the rooms were booked. So instead of renting two rooms as planned, we had to rent just one.The A/C in the room was terrible, it hardly cooled the room down - probably because the insulation was so bad you could see the sunlight around the edges of the room door (which also meant you could hear every person running by and yelling at all hours). The sink in our room also clogged several times.We found several cockroaches crawling in various places (including the bed). We all have random bug bites now, probably from mosquitoes coming in thanks to the poorly sealed door. There were odd stains on the ceiling as well.The free WIFI came in and out, and it interrupts your browsing with full in-browser ads, which actually gave our laptop a virus. It slowed down our computer noticeably during our stay so we checked when we got home and had to remove it.They gave us two tiny bottles of shampoo (no conditioner) and two bars of soap, for a room that's supposed to sleep four people. Three towels, and two hand towels. There was no ice machine, and you have to pay for a mini fridge. They also had no complimentary breakfast in the mornings.All in all, a huge disappointment and we definitely will not be staying at this hotel again. Don't recommend it to anyone else.
The front of the hotel looks very nice and we were actually pleasantly surprised when we pulled in the driveway--if only our room in the back had been so nice. It looks like they invested all of the renovation money in the front of the hotel, NOT in the back, where there are quite a few rooms. Aside from the room looking dingy and feeling gross, there was a crack between the doorjam and the actual door that you could peek through into the room if you leaned up to the crack--it was wide enough that the brochures the local eateries were sliding into the door went all the way in easily! The broken mini-fridge was actually propped up with the Bible. There was no way I was going to let my kids stay in this motel, we checked out and went to the Days Inn Airport--which was 5 cheaper a night, and although it was no palace, at least we felt safe and had a clean place to stay! I wish that I had just booked a hotel chain I trust from the beginning instead of trying to save a little money--learn from my mistakes!
The room is old and not taken care of. A piece of metal is screwed into the wall where the door handle went through. Pieces of unmatched tile around the tub enclosure not even cut correctly and God knows what was around the faucet. It seems they are only interested in your money and not maintaining the rooms.
We were delayed on our flight back to the UK by 6 hours and decided to book into a motel to wait. Days Inn was first we found and under 50 for a night. So v. cheap with free Wi-Fi and coffee machine. However, the lift was not confidence inspiring and creaked and crashed, the room was not as clean as it may be, we were pleased not to get in the beds and the general environment felt a bit rough/unsafe. We were fine though and had no real issues. Free Wi-Fi dropped constantly and the a/c would not stay on - kept cutting out. I would not stay overnight or at least not more than night and would only do so as a single traveller. Not quite an avoid but go with eyes open.
Coming from Texas I booked online and checked all the pictures available before and it was good. But when I got there this one was terrible specially considering that it is a prime location for tourism in orlando. Walls were peeling off, very dirty, sink was not working neither the hair dryer. No refrigerator or microwave, when I went downstairs to get ice, machine does not work either. Black mold in the shower and lamps that did not work. Original carpet was replaced without removing the sides showing old carpet. At the website they say free wifi and breakfast.... Free wifi yes but no breakfast.
The staff were horrible!!!!!!! We told them there were bed bugs on our pillows and we have photos and a video to prove it!!!!! They treated us as if we brought the bugs with us!!!!!!.Yes,they changed our room but rented the room to someone else .We will never stay at this hotel again and will share this story to everyone The manager never contacted us !!!!!!!
the only thing about the hotel it was dusty plus the AC dripped water outside and my dad that is 75 years old fell because it was slippery which i didn't like that at all he got his knee scraped all.
The room was very clean but the property is old. The bathroom ceiling looked moldy. It did not smell bad.
This place needs a complete restoration. Ceilings and walls have patches everywhere. The room smells like mold. The towels are like sandpaper. Bedding is stained and mattresses are sagging. The tub is dripping. There are plenty of cockroaches. I could go into more detail, but then I might throw up.
Filthiest hotel I've ever stayed at. Room service didn't change the sheets once during a 5 night stay, they only replaced towels. Door didn't close properly allowing loud noises to enter room 24/7. Phone and alarm clock didn't work. Half the lights didn't work. Literal holes in wall, peeling paint. Disgusting.
We paid for a cheap room and we got it. The place seemed kind of sketchy. Had my husband not had a concealed license and been carrying his gun we probably wouldn't of stayed here. We only needed one night to sleep. We did check the beds first and slept fine. We would not go back to this motel though.
Sheets were dirty, beds were uncomfortable, floor was filthy with big burn marks in carpet from previous guest. Had to ask for a bag for the ice bucket, no lid. Fell on the stairs
I arrived late at night and the night watchman managed to mangle my reservation. Fortunately the receptionist in the morning managed to sort out a little matter of double billing due to the nightwatchman's mangle. The room was on the second floor and ok. Price was good and I might stay here again if I am ever back in Orlando.
I have stayed at days inn in the past this was the worst stay I have ever had I am disabled my friends were to stay close by to help me that is the way the rooms were rented that is not what happened they were put upstairs no air conditioner no phone hook up and maintence said what do you want for 40 dollars the worst stay I ever had the front desk girl 2nd shift very rude not acceptable
Horrible motel, rooms smell of damp, people wandering in off the street to do their laundry or use the pool. Security practically non-existent. Staff can't speak basic English and are constantly on their mobiles!!! You will not feel safe here especially if you have children. Awful!!
We checked in and the front lobby looks nice. The lady gave us our key card and we went to our room. We turned the lights on, the room smelt like mold. We turned the bathroom lights on and bugs were crawling all over the floor and walls. So we went back and asked for another room. They gave us a different room. When we got to that room, it smelt like smoke and not mold and again bugs all in the bath tub! Just a gross hotel.
I requested a non-smoking room due to having asthma. I was very tired that night and just wanted to sleep. Well once I entered the room, I felt like I just went into a cigar bar. It was awful. The smoke smell was so strong. I attempted to call the front desk but the phone wasn't working. No dial tone at all. It was 1am and I was so tired that I just fell asleep on the bed. The smoke smell kept waking me up till I had to put the blanket over my head the whole night. A roach was also on the nightstand and rug stains all throughout the room. Most disgusting experience from a hotel in my life.
Days Inn Orlando Fl 5858 international dive by Wet N Wild, 7-11, and Red Lobster.Would pick a better Hotel next time. For starters they advertise to give shuttles to the parks however that shuttle service is one drop off time and a few pick up times. We were going to Universal Studio which opens at 10 but the shuttle doesnt leave until 10:45. The park closes at 8 but the shuttle picks up at 7:15 and 10:15. However Universal studios is in walking distance, so we choice to walk. It took us about 20 minutes to walk along with a wheelchair, so many may be able to walk faster. Also the shuttle require a 24 hour notice for wheelchairs. So since we didnt know exactly when we would need them ahead of time we were not able to use their shuttle.We started in room 275. We let the front desk know that we needed a fridge, as we have meds that have to be kept cold, and they did get us a fridge. The fridge does keep things cold but doesnt seal on top. You can put your finger right into the fridge. So we put a towel on top to help keep things out and the fridge cold. Fridges and Microwaves are available for an extra 10 charge. However, the next day, we found some uninvited bugs in our room. Not the end of world but I really am bug-a-phobic. I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to spray while we were out. When we got back they had the fan on in the bathroom and we didnt see anything.. But the next morning we I had to turn the light on for the bathroom we found more. We quickly got dress as we kept finding more and my husband went to speak the manager. We were asked to wait a half hour for the manager to come in. Half hour later, the manager was in a meeting so my husband told the front desk lady the issues. They called in a contractor to spray and moved us to room 105. The new room was much bigger and nicer looking. Plus it had a table and two chairs which was not in the other room.The door to room 275 didnt really seal at all. You could see the light from outside and pizza places where putting ads/coupons in the door frames. The ads would come right through the right side of the door and fall to floor a few feet in. In room 105 the door sealed better but there were people outside smoking and talking and you could totally hear them plus smell their smoking in the room. At least the ads got stuck in the door. Everything went ok after that except for toilet overflowing once. My husband quickly shut off the water to the toilet and we put down towels on the floor. I called the front desk and a lady came down to our room and asked what was wrong, although I explained it over the phone. They sent down the maintenance guy who just fixed the toilet. My husband asked if it was going to get cleaned up and we were told yes but that is housekeepings job. 15 minutes later we recalled the front desk and asked if someone was going to clean up the mess and bring us new towels. We had used towel to clean up the water. Housekeeping was around shortly after to cleanup and put in new towels. Other issue with the room beside it being run down was hearing everything that was going on outside.The hotel does not have a continental breakfast but they told us there is a Deli but we just went to Wal-Mart for quick breakfast foods. There is also 7-11 two spots down and Dennys and I-Hop are across the street.The interest is also issues at this hotel. There is Wi-Fi here but often the internet will not work. I know the issue is not my computer as my laptop is running just fine. I took the downtime to do extra maintenance work and write start to write this review.Our children did try the pool but shortly came back because they said it was cold and not that clean.. However it was a windy day so that may be why. Over all about a two star hotel which does have some issues but they are in the perfect location with Wet n Wild being about a block, Universal Studios in walking distance, and the I-trolley stop for SeaWorld and anything else on international drive as one the trolley I-ride stop is just across the street. For me I would rather stay at one of the nicer hotels, which seem to be closer to SeaWorld as the ones on the south side of International Drive look a bit older and run down.
Woman rude at front desk. 1 person paid--2 people couldn't pay for the room. 1 room old dirty carpet in 403, 401 had tile-good. Bathroom very fan noisy. AC turned off with a loud sigh EVERY time. It looked clean. Couldn't control cold, needed an extra cover-none. Did bring 1 not 2. We were there because of the cost.
Think of the meth hotel in Breaking Bad and you might be able to visualize the filthiness, the rundown, the broken items in this room. There is.mold in the bathroom, black hair in the shower, I can't say one good thing about it. Never never book a reservation here unless it't for someone you hate and even then it might be too much.
I as at a conference at the OCCC and the days inn was only 10 minutes walk away from the center. So a super location.The pool was rather cold, but i did not have time to get into it anyway. The room was clean and okay. For the price it was excelent, but I have been in nicer rooms.
The place is ion a good location, staff is friendly but no refrigerator or microwave, so if you are planning to stay more than one night just know that you will be spending a lot of money.
Room had funny smell, bugs, no phone no clock, no iron, bathroom was dirty. The room was just not very nice and they couldn't put us next to our family even though there was no one in the room next to us the entire stay. The only good thing was it's location and price but I guess you get what you pay for. They only had one room key. We be choosing another hotel next time...and we don't recommend it. I have stayed at Days Inn hotels and have had nothing but good experiences until this visit.
it is ok, great location, very clean rooms, near to everything on International drive, walking distance to great restaurants and activities, but customer service need to improve, upon my arrival ! I went to the front desk, and the lady on front desk was really rude, for me customer services is needs to be number one... Great location , but customer services is 0.
To be on a very important intersection like international Dr. Orlando this hotel is terrible. The bed was sunk in in the middle the tv is outdated plaster on ceiling in the bathroom I will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone. It really needs an upgrade.
his name is em. when i checked in, I told him many times that I will settle my bill with cash when checking out. he still charged my credit card.cockroaches were found in my room and outside the balcony.it is unbelievable that the room has no fridge.
The General Manager was absolute jerk to me, my fianc and my friends who also had their own room. The other front desk representatives were equally unwelcoming and rude! The advertised room price was not honored at all and I inquired while they were actually putting the discounted price up! With the poor level of customer service and the false advertising, I actually thought about reporting them. It was a Vacation and I wasnt trying to spend my time thinking about legal issues. But I was apauled by this hotel. Never will I stay with them again.
I have been in multiple Days Inn properties and I like them. This one is not among them. I picked this one as of proximity of my meeting location - I now wish I should have choose something else.Confusing floor plan spread across 2 different buildings. Hanging stuff in bathroom, you cant understand weather you have open or shut a tap. Either you get too cold water or too hot water. No breakfast at all - there is buffet you can pay but that is just OK. Inconsistent WiFi and bad room lightning. Staff are good - but they are overloaded. Hence very little time for checking with you.
Booked this hotel for the price. Amazing price, great location but.....you get what you paid for. One of the beds were broken, the room smelled like bug spray (I guess at least they spray), no hot water in the shower, the property looks like a prison, carpet was at least 400yrs old. But, location is 1mi from universal and will serve its purpose for one night at that great price.
The room had no coffee maker in it. I went to the front desk and told them. They said they would have one brought to me. Half an hour later i called the front desk and the phone rung for about 20 or more times until someone decided to pick up. Then i had to explain that i had went to the office and no one had came to the room and brought the coffee maker to me yet and finally after another 5-10 mins of waiting they came and gave it to me. It was not a good experience at all. The only reason i got the room was becasue i had to be at the airport early in the morning, mind you that i did not get there to check in until 930pm.
This is not an attractive hotel. It is an old hotel. There were spider webs near the sink. There was mold inside of the restroom (near the shower). There was no microwave or refrigerator. I was told to go downstairs to get extra towels. There were a lot of human noise outside during the night. Prostitutes seem to be roaming on the property. During checkout, the guy at the front desk seemed nonchalant when questions were asked.
Will definatley stay again next year as rooms decent size and beds made and room cleaned new fresh towels every day and good size pool and loungers plenty off theres also a laundry and drier and its next to convention centre and great area on international drive geat holiday just home xthe hotel is also joined onto the I hop restaurant and they do fab pancakes my daughter was in shock also mcdonalds across road and 2 supermarkets x
we stayed there for three nights. they have shuttle buses to sea world, epcot, magic kingdom and universal. no breakfast but there is a seven eleven next to it where you can buy stuff you need. there is no need to take a cab from the airport if you dont mind taking the bus which is 2 dollars and runs ever 30 minutes to orlando international airport.the rooms are okay some do not have a good wifi acces.
I can't believe this was a days inn. I tried to book a days inn near the convention center, and that's the location I clicked, but somehow it booked me at this location. Where to start... no phone, lamps didn't work, sheets didn't fit the bed, patched up tiles in the bathroom to cover holes (and none of it matched), exposed electrical outlets hanging out of the walls, housekeeping didn't clean anything (not even the toilet) during my stay. My rooms door had been pried opened, and hammered back to seal the door, Worst hotel I've ever been at.
The hotel doors hardly close and open very well. There was a couple next-door that plays music very loud and you could smell marijuana coming through the room. The front desk that was not very friendly .
There is no fridge, no microwave, no hanger. The safe isn't work. My trip was a disaster they do not serve any breakfast. No more please stay away
The Hotel seems to have some really nice staff. The people staying in the hotel are a mix of sketchy to good people. The rooms need maintenance and repainted. the TV quality was poor. There was only one ice machine. There is no Breakfast. Pool area was okay. The picture in our room looked like it was on its last leg. Did not see any bugs. Bed was Comfortable.
I stayed at this hotel for two weeks last summer. The hotel itself is nothing special, but it was fine for what I was paying. In honesty, I would pay more to have a better hotel, but I dont regret staying there.The room was clean, it was spacious, but basic. The only complaints I had were that the air con was quite noisy and leaked a bit, and after nobody turned up to fix it, I just switched it off completely. Another complaint was the safe. When I arrived, there was no door on it at all, but after one call, they came and fixed it.Another was just the position of the room. I was on the first floor, and at the main entrance to the rooms in the hotel, so EVERYONE walked past my room constantly, and they weren't quiet, and especially at night, this did bother me a little, but that was minor, and not the hotels fault.In future, I would rather pay a little bit more for a nicer hotel, but if I couldnt afford to, I'd be quiet happy staying here. It's in a GREAT location, and I felt safe enough to walk around at night on my own.
My family and I were at the days inn for 5 days. We had 3 different rooms during this stay. Each room had a different problem. The first room the airconditioner leaked all over the rug. The second room had a leak into the bathroom light. The third room the airconditioner hardly worked at all. Each room was filthy. I seen either dead roaches or live roaches in each room. I know florida has bug problems but the hotel should have an exterminator on the premises. The hotel also needs more cleaning staff. I really was afraid to sit on the toilets and had a hard time sleeping because of the bugs. I have stayed in budget hotels before but this on was the worst. It was also dangerous, due to the plumbing issues. In fact, this hotel just needs to be condemned!
After my husband deploying out overseas I needed some well deserved girl time weekend. We rented several rooms and was so plesently surprised wtih everything. We weren't sure what things to see in the area and did not want to miss anything worth seeing. The manager took extra time to explain food, entertainment and girl things to do in the area which he felt we wouldn't want to miss. This really helped we girl get alot of things of enjoyment thanks to him. We found most things close to hotel and rooms were clean. I look foward to more girls weekends there.
Room had a yucky smell, lights did not all work, each day we did not receive towels, workers at the front desk were not very pleasant to deal with and once we arrived, the rate went up from what we was quoted! Will not be staying there again!
ALthough for the price the room was average, there was no coffee maker and they would not accept my AARP card.
Illegal activity going on the parking lot when we arrived. There was women standing next to motels doors waiting to be served or get served no working vending machines for a soft drink. Black mold growing in the ceiling of our room. The room stunk terribly. There were holes all in the walls and they were patched with thin metal plates. My husband stepped on something and come to find out, it was an extention cord running underneath the carpet, from the out side to the air conditioner inside. We wedged two chairs next to the door because it would not shut properly. The shower head was about to fall out. We felt gross even after a bath. We slept fully dressed because I didn't want any of body parts touching the bed.
The bill receipt which I have received from Days Inn says 376 dollar for two room but when I checked my credit statement it shows two transaction of 204 was charged.
I had booked this hotel for my mom on a last min. when i tryed to call to see if my mom checked in thay did not ansewer the phones for about 2 hrs straight had to call the 800 to see if she got there.. she had told me the next morning that the room smelled musty and was not as clean she expected paying 100.00 + for the night we will say we will not be back there...
Aunque el hotel en sus instalaciones esta completamente nuevo, el servicio de limpieza pasa solo cada 8 dias! y aseo general cada 15, queda lejos de todo, no tiene piscina, creo que para una emergencia de ultima hora funcionaria bien porque no veo ningun servicio que valga la pena resaltar. El precio es lo llamativo del lugar.
I stayed ONE night, before I could get my bag out of the car, I was propositioned twice, and three times asked if I wanted to buy drugs. Then in the room it looked like one of those rooms out of a horror story, dried blood on the sheets roaches crawling on the floor, Seeing we were new to Florida... More

My name is Cathy and after visting the Mosley Motel on December 2, 2011 I thought is was a great place to live. They have new management and staff, who were very friendly and helpful. For Christmas they gave me and my two children Christmas gifts and a wonderful Christmas meal. Keep up the good work Mosley Motel.
This place is overall disgusting. I used a whole can of roach spray the first night. The staff act as if you're infringing on their time when maintenance is needed. Stay away from this roach-infested crack house.
The hotel was very comfortable and kept VERY clean. We stayed an extra night because of a storm. The staff -Shanna, Laura, Lindsey and Julie- made us feel welcome. They were a friendly group which is appreciated when you unexpectedly spend an extra night.
I've been wanting to stay here for a few months and finally got the chance. None of the awesome pictures on Trip Advisor and the Roxbury website compare to what you'll see in person. There is SO much detail in every room according to the theme of that room. No stones were left unturned completing the rooms. I was able... More

I rented the Amadeus Bride suite for a group of 6 girls for a bachelorette party. We LOVED the room and had the best time! The decor was amazing and so unique - we just wish we could have had a tour of the other rooms! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We loved being able to use the... More

This place was a great place to stay. It's very close to RMNP. It's very affordable (this is a relative measure since it's Estes Park). It was very relaxing. Our unit sleeps six but we had three.

stayed in 4. The layout was good for one of their small suites. Had elk in the driveway the first morning. A limited view of the river across the road. Staff was nice and the fruit available in the office was a nice touch. Reasonable price for Estes Park. Nice access to town and park. RMNP is the true reason... More
We stayed here for 3 nights. The location was just right to be far enough out of the crazy of downtown, but close enough to get everywhere within 5 minutes. The chalets are private with some units having a hot tub. We didn't opt for one. There was a gas grill and patio furniture for our unit. It was very... More

The hotel is located near Csu campus and also the town center. Surrounded by many restaurants and coffee shops. The rooms are large and clean. The staff are very nice and helpful. Need to be careful of the noises of some rooms.
This hotel is really charming, clean and it is a great location in Fort Collins. Our room was spacious and the bed was really comfortable. I would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Fort Collins!
The Edge is a clean hotel with an attractive and inviting lobby. The rooms are comfortable and clean as well. There is an excellent family restaurant within walking distance. We enjoyed our brief stay.
Have spent a week in the fall for the last 9 years to enjoy golf on this scenic and interesting course in the Shenandoah Valley! Look forward to it next year!!

I was a little tentative to come here because we usually stay at another hotel we really like. We were picking our daughter up from college and this hotel was just what we needed. The room and hotel was clean and it was quiet. The breakfast was good. I would recommend gettng some sugar free syrup.I have to say, I love the staff at this hotel. They are REALLY nice people. Steven at the front desk is very nice and I can't say enough about Brian Knopp. We were moving our daughter out of the dorm and she had extra activities she was involved with and it was leaving us with little time and we didn't know how we were going to manage it. In talking we Steve, he said he could give us an extra hour at check out , but not only that, they let us come back later in the day to freshen up before an event we had to go to. I had asked to use the public bathroom, but Brian wouldn't have that and let use a vacant room. We only needed it for about 30 minutes, so it worked out perfectly. We were so grateful for the hospitality they provided.I would come back to this hotel in a heart beat.We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. Your survey responses will serve as encouragement to all of our staff as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our services to provide an exceptional experience for our guests. It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback.Thank you again for sharing your experience, and we look forward to your next visit!Safe Travels,Brian Knopp, General ManagerCOMFORT INN SUITES - LynchburgA New Level of Comfort!
I always enjoy my stay they have a walk in special. I suggest you book then when you get there cancel and take advantage of special. Room is always comfortable and it's quiet within walking distance to eating and shopping.

After 10 years here I can say without a doubt it's the best resort here.

I had a great experience at HotelRED. The staff was incredibly friendly. I did however find empty candy wrappers underneath the couch in my room. The room was not dirty at all, but it seems they didn't take the extra care to look underneath the couch when cleaning.
This was unlike any hotel I'd ever stayed in before and I thought the amenities were out of sight. The showers were high class and the beds were maybe the most comfortable beds I'd ever slept in at a hotel.
My experience was enjoyable, the staff was very accommodating and friendly.......the Hotel does and excellent job of making the guests feel special and welcome. Glad to have this caliber of hotel to stay at during my travels to Madison.......really do not have any suggestions for improvement, keep doing what you have in place.
What a total gem in downtown Madison! Rooms are elegant and hip, staff went above and beyond any call of duty to make my daughter traveling with me feel very comfortable and welcome at a very fancy hotel. We stayed in a suite and couldn't have been happier--the kitchen was perfect for us and the layout of the suite was... More
I had no idea a place like this could exist in Wisconsin... The industrial theme (concrete floors, exposed ducts, modern furniture, etc.) made us feel like we were in a loft in Uptown Minneapolis... The ambiance at the hotel restaurant (The Wise) was unbelievable, and the food was outstanding. All in all, this place was awesome.
Awesome location, the balcony and shower (jets with overhead rain) were amazing perks. The staff was all very friendly. Our whole group wanted slippers and extra blankets and everything was brought up to our room extremely fast. The only complaint I have was feeling pushed out by the cleaning crew the next morning at 9am when I had until 12pm... More
Within walking distance of everything we wanted to do, this super contemporary hotel offered architectural pleasure and an outstanding and friendly staff. The quiet, comfortable atmosphere: just what we needed.
Our family has stayed at this hotel several times. It is clean - in our room, the lobby and restaurant. We have also found it quiet at night - despite being on a college campus. The staff are wonderful and you can't beat the location with all downtown Madison has to offer. We will definitely be back!
Stayed here for a night. It is in poor condition and needs a lot of work. The place was quiet and I felt safe. But, it was not very nice. I would not recommend this place. There are far better places to stay in Ashland.
So this is a hidden gem. It was clear they remodeled. New carpet, new mattresses etc. The bathroom could use an update but were fine. The cabins are perfect for families. There's a fire pit and chairs to hang outside too. Right on the lake. There's a grill but needs a cleaning before getting used. It was quite and about... More
I think this may be a homeless shelter.Needed an overnight in the area and just looked at a room. Couldn't stay there. Too bad because the location has potential.Nice guy at the desk and plenty of parking.
The hotel were helpful assisting us with questions before our stay, and we're happy to let us leave our car and luggage for the full day before checking in so that we could enjoy the day at Disney. The managers / owners () were really friendly and gave great service. The room was clean,spacious and modern with more facilities (fridge, coffee maker and microwave) than some 4 star hotels we stayed in on our trip. It was a 15-20 min walk to Disney which was really convenient and there is a shuttle bus which stops outside. I would happily recommend this hotel to family and friends
We stayed only one night at this hotel. It was clean, modern and comfortable. The lady at the front desk even allowed us to park in the car park well before check in so we could go to Disneyland. Recommended, would stay there again!

Staff are professional pleasant. Rooms are CLEAN comfortable. Quality breakfast provided, with options for varying diets. The heated indoor pool is well maintained. Floor does get slick though! When travelling to Kingston, NY this is the first Hotel I check for room availability!Thank you for the rating and the wonderful review. We appreciate you sharing your comments on our facility and staff. Great that we are your first choice!! Thanks!
This hotel is situated right in the heart of the city, so is perfect for tourists. It has history, and has a comfortable feel to it. The rooms are well appointed, and the bed was one of the most comfiest we ve ever slept in. We didn t eat in the restaurant as it was quite pricy. The one thing that detracted from our visit, and this was nothing to do with the hotel, is that there are some really weird dropouts hanging around, and they made us feel quite uncomfortable at times.
Great location, we walked to, many of the down town areas, most of the time. Monorail station is adjacent to the hotel. Light rail is less than a block away. Bed was very comfortable. The hotel is very quite. Lots of shopping available close to the hotel. We were upgraded to a room with double bathrooms- VERY NICE!!!

This was my third time staying at the Mayflower and I love everything about it. It is beautiful, the location is fantastic, could not ask for better service and what's not to love about a martini bar just feet away from the elevator. I received a complimentary upgrade to a suite and it was perfect!!!!
This was a great hotel. Check in efficient and we were given maps and local information. The room was very spacious, clean, quiet and not over-heated.A great location to walk to all key attractions - shopping, Seattle Centre, Pike market place.Would be happy to recommend this hotel to any of my friends travelling to Seattle.
Stayed here on a few day holiday to Seattle. Location is pretty good so it has that. I also appreciate every hotel in Seattle is hugely expensive but this place is very high and for this sort of price I expect perfection and having stayed all over the world in top business hotels in major cities this was just poor comparedStaff on desk were very pretentious and i felt thought their hotel was above us, the internet was essentially unusable and it just did not feel welcomingMatthew L,Thank you for your comments. I would like to hear more about your experience with the front desk staff as they are such an essential part of the hotel experience. Please feel free to reach out to me via email so I can try to find where we can improve for our guests benefit. Best Regards, -Taylor England - Front Office Manager - tayloremayflowerpark.com
The Mayflower Park hotel is located in a great place if you like to walk around the attractions of Seattle. Easy access by light rail from the airport,about halfan hours travel and frequent departures. Only one and a half block away from the station.Three blocks away from Pike Market Place, one block from the tramway to Union lake and close to shopping. The staff are very helpful and friendly.The hotel is one of the historic Hotels of the USA and has been beautifully maintained and refurbished.I stayed there twice and was very happy with my rooms, which were spacious and well appointed.
I grabbed this good deal on Hotwire for about 80 per night. Of course, being right in the city, we had to pay for valet parking through the hotel for 20 per night. But this still was cheaper than most hotels in the area. This hotel was by far the fanciest accommodations we stayed in on our trip to Washington State, and a great way to end our vacation.Since we left the car with the valets (and didnt want to pay for parking around the city), we simply walked everywhere around town. Pike Place Market is just four blocks from the hotel, and the waterfront is just a few blocks past that. We walked over to the Seattle Center (10 blocks), but have to admit that we rode the monorail back. It stops right in the mall that connects to the back of the hotel--very convenient!! We also walked to Pioneer Square (13 blocks) and even walked to the REI flagship store (13 blocks).We stayed on the 8th floor, looking towards 5th Street. Our room with a king-sized bed was super comfy and everything was extremely clean.
This hotel is like being in Mecca if you're idea of Nirvana is shopping. It is very easy to locate in Seattle. The car valets were helpful and courteous. The front desk staff were prompt. And the concierge, well, he was the absolute best we have ever had. He had suggestions for shows, attractions, timelines, and restaurants. He even made suggestions for what to order off the menus!The room we had was a standard with a small queen. It was a corner room with 2 windows that opened to let in fresh air (yes, you need fresh air even in frigid February). It was a little stuffy without the windows being left open. I would say spend a little extra money and get a deluxe room with a king. The bathroom was also very small and not big enough for 2 people sharing! Definitely need either 2 bathrooms (as some of the more deluxe rooms have), or ask for one with a larger bathroom.However, we didn't spend hardly any time in the hotel as we were out and about so much.The location was ideal. One block from either direction of both Macy's and Nordstrom's (and about 6 Starbuck's coffee bars in a 4 block radius). Plus, just 5 minute walks from other name-brand chains. And close to Pike Place market and great venues like the Triple Door, and fantastic restaurants. Too many restaurants to choose from. All that means is that we will need to go back and try them all out. And we will definitely be staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel plan to make it 'our hotel' whenever we go to Seattle.
Very OLD hotel with rooms that have probably been improved sometime within the last 4 decades, but hard to tell. Great downtown location, with the light rail station to the airport and monorail to the Space Needle and music museum essentially in-house. The bar Olivers and restaurant Andaluca are above average. But the rooms are old, the bathrooms cramped and cracked and showing age, the carpet stained and threadbare. And the WORST hotel towels I have experienced since a visit to a Motel 6 in the '80s . . . a car wash would be ashamed to use these sandpaper-like mini-towels. No mini-bar, must pay for ANY bottled water . . . but at least internet access was complimentary. All told, not bad, but I think I will try something else next time.
We ended up staying here last minute when other plans fell through and we were very pleased. It's within walking distance to Seattle Center which makes it great if you're going to the Pacific Science Center which was the reason for our visit. The room was great and the staff was very helpful. It's kind of tucked away in a semi-industrial looking area which concerned me a little bit at first because we had our young children with us but after walking around the neighborhood at night I realized it wasn't a problem. There is a QFC (grocery store) just around the corner which was great for grabbing snacks for the room and a quick bite before we hit Seattle Center. You can walk to Pike Market from here but it's about 1.5 miles away. We just walked there during the day and took a cab back to the hotel at night. All in all I enjoyed the stay there and would recommend it if you want to be in the Seattle Center area.
We came in a day early for our Alaskan cruise, and we stayed the night at the Four Points by Sheraton. It was very conveniently located for sightseeing as the Space Needle and Chihuly Gardens are only a ten minute walk away. We ate dinner at the restaurant at the hotel, and the food was good. The portions are generous. The waiter was very friendly and told us stories about working as a commercial fisherman in Alaska. Everyone at the hotel is very friendly. We did have one odd experience. They signed us up for a shuttle to take us to the cruise terminal, simply putting us on a list. When the shuttle driver dropped us off at the terminal, he told us we needed to give him a voucher or pay him 7 per person. This was odd since no mention was ever given of the need to have a 7 voucher when we talked to the front desk about the shuttle. I'm not sure what happened there, but since everything else went so well, I'm thinking it must have just been an oversight. I was more than willing to pay for the transportation, but it just felt very awkward. Overall though it was a very good visit. Dear Christine, Thank you so much for your kind review, we really appreciate your comments regarding our convenient location, the Fire Side Cafe restaurant and our friendly staff! I am very sorry for the miscommunication about the shuttle to the terminal. We should have been more efficient at communicating the 7 cost per person for the transportation. We are very happy you had a good visit over all, and hope to see you again the next time you are in Seattle!
I always stay at this Four Points in Seattle because I am welcomed with a warm smile. It makes me feel less distant from my family and cheers me up after a long day of travel. After only two stays, Abdi remembered me. He greets me by name and introduces me to his colleagues, like long time friends. Outside of feeling at home, this property is modern and well maintained. Has underground parking and gym. It is centrally located to great restaurants, sites and running paths. Enjoy your stay.
Our family stayed there for one evening in March and were not impressed. The hotel is newly renovated, however the building is quite old. You can hear people walking, talking, running. If you have kids staying above your suite, good luck on getting any sleep. While having breakfast, in the morning, the fire alarm went off, and it was very loud and went off for quite some time, possibly 10 min, we were all looking at each other, thinking what to do, while the staff was walking around casually, there was no direction, evacuation procedure, zero communication. Finally, we asked one of the servers if he knew what was happening, he explained that they will be here soon to fix it. That was it. After we checked out, my wife realized that she had left her gold bracelet on the night table. We phoned the hotel and returned only to find nothing and that the staff no e speak English. Only the cleaning staff has access to a securely card-lock controlled room. We are told basically too bad, so sad. We wrote letter and called the hotel and head office. The same response, sorry, could not find it Basically, the gold bracelet walked out of the room on its own. Very dissatisfied and unhappy. Very unresponsive management. Will not stay there, nor will we recommend it. We paid to stay at a hotel and get robbed.Dear Valued Guest,We appreciate your candid response. I apologize on behalf of Four Points by Sheraton that your stay was not as expected.Yes we are a fully renovated new hotel in Seattle, and I apologize for the fire alarm. When this happened we were instructed by the Fire Department to wait until they arrived to silence it.Regarding your gold bracelet, as we discussed earlier, we did do a thorough investigation looking for this and questioned our staff. The Housekeeper that cleaned your room is a trusted and valued employee. It is unfortunate the bracelet was missing, but were not able to locate it anywhere.I apologize for these situations again. By far, most guest experiences here are excellent and guests are pleased. If we are able to have you back please contact me so that I can personally make sure we take care of your stay.Thank you,Joe AlbertsGeneral Manager
You can walk to the Space Needle, and the fabulous Glass Garden in minutes, and there is a grocery store as well as many local restaurants all within walking distance. The Hotel was very nice, one night they had a free craft beer tasting with free appetizers, very nice touch. We stayed in a two room suite - was a bit shop worn furniture, rug wise, but all else was nice and clean. Staff were helpful, however some didn't understand English. Breakfast was great. A nice, clean and convenient place to stay!
We had two rooms booked for a post cruise stay at this hotel. We checked in for 2 nights on July 22. When we entered the hotel lobby there were a ton of people either waiting for rooms or trying to check in. It seemed there was no organization at all.I am an SPG member and booked one king room on points and booked a 2 bedroom suite at full rate. At the desk, I was not greeted as an SPG member. I was told our rooms would not be available until 3pm. It was about 10am. I complained a bit and was told the hotel was fully booked the night before and there is nothing available. My group and I decided to book a tour of Seattle to pass the next few hours.We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and found only one room available. Needless to say, this did not sit well with my group. We were all very tired and just wanted to get to our room to relax. About 45 minutes later, a room was found for us and we were told to head up...except and the other desk attendant said No, that room is set for another person. The woman helping us said that the room in question should not have been given to another party. Now we are mad. Finally the woman helping me found yet another room. I told my party our initial room was given away and that second desk attendant chimed in with no it wasn't. Those other people have been waiting since 7 am! Once we finally received the room key we grabbed our luggage and tried to get on the elevator. What a mess that was! There was a group of folks with a luggage cart filled to the brim trying to maneuver it onto the elevator. It was too heavy for the elevator so they were stuck half in and half out blocking up the hallway! Finally we got through and went up to our room.Our room was the 2 bedroom king suite. It was a nice room. Unfortunately there was a big iron mark in the rug but it was clean. There are no phones in the bedrooms. Only one phone on the desk in the living room. The room was spacious and comfortable. There is only one bathroom. It has 2 doors, one opens to the main living area and the other opens to a bedroom. One problem in the bedroom was the door stop for the bathroom door is right by the bed where you step when getting out of bed! That is a design flaw that really should be corrected! The bath was large and clean.As usual in the Sheraton chain, the bedding is fantastic! Overall, the room was great for what we needed. It slept the three of us comfortably. The location is good to the Space Needle. The area is a bit rundown but there are some places to eat, which we did not do. I would stay here again if they work out the delays in check in. In the meantime, if you are staying here, I suggest you request a guaranteed early check in time to avoid the hassles we endured. I did explain all of these concerns on my SPG emailed survey and was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the hotel manager via email. He apologized for the circumstances and said the hotel is working on the influx of cruise passengers and trying to figure out its policies for check in times. His prompt response was unexpected and completely appreciated! I was also issued some SPG points as compensation. Because of his attention I do not hesitate to recommend this property. It is a fair price in a good location with fantastic beds!
This hotel has what you need. Nice friendly staff, well set up clean rooms, close to activities, priced competitively. Stayed 2 nights July 5th and 6th before departing on Alaska cruise. They included breakfast do to construction across street. I would recommend and certainly stay here again.
Seven of us flew into Seattle relatively late in the day and stayed overnight at the Four Points. The next AM we were able to use a meeting room to prepare for our business meeting in Seattle (walking distance from the hotel, in fact). While the hotel does not have a lot of frills but the kitchen was open until 10:00 and the bar until midnight and the staff was both accommodating and friendly. The hotel had a functional exercise room that is open 24 hrs (six pieces of standard equipment and a set of weights) which is adequate for the number rooms. Although ostensibly a tobacco free facility I was fairly certain that one of the previous guests smoked extensively in my room which detracted from my visit as did the noise from the ice machine directly opposite my room. The room in fact was a roomy king with a good desk with multiple power outlets. WiFi was complimentary. All in all the price was right compared to other higher end places in the neighborhood.Thank you for sharing your review. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your experience while staying with us and are glad we were able to assist you in preparing for your business meeting. We take great pride in providing our guests with a smoke-free environment and apologize for any lingering traces of smoke. We will share this feedback with the team to ensure this does not happen again. We are glad you found our team to be both friendly and accommodating and we look forward to seeing you again, Steve. Take care.
I enjoyed a nice visit to the Four Points. The front desk team is very welcoming. Parking is very secure and only accessed by room key. One suggestion is to request an interior room as it may be quieter. Earplugs are provided (which says something), but I couldn't sleep in them. Also, if you are a coffee drinker, go ahead and ask for extra coffee pods and creamer at the beginning. Restaurant food was very good for breakfast and dinner.
Due to its proximity near Key Arena (where I was seeing a concert), Id figure it would be best to stay at a nearby Starwood property. This particular location was about a 10 minute walk (1km) to the venue, with restaurants along the way, and its also near the Seattle Space Needle for those who want to do some sightseeing. Note that this property use to be under the management of Comfort Suites.I redeemed my Starpoints for this stay this was an SPG category 3 hotel, with redemption starting at 7,000 starpoints. Parking was 15/night and is underground and gated.A walk into the lobby and you can tell that it was recently renovated, with a huge lobby, dining, and bar area. There was a dedicated SPG check-in counter along with dedicated SPG rooms. This property was also recently upgraded to RFID sensor locks instead of the traditional old style swipe card door lock. This was a nice feature due to the recent security concerns with the swipe card locks.Upon check-in I was told that I received a complimentary upgrade to their Deluxe Room (from Traditional), which features larger rooms and a sofa/couch. The hotel window faces the Space Needle and the Bill Gates Foundation. I was also offered the choice of a complimentary drink or extra points. No point asking for complimentary wi-fi since their wi-fi cost is already included in the room price.For those who dont know, Four Points is considered one of the budget brandings for Starwood. I came here with no high expectations at all. However, to my surprise, I would consider this a pretty good property with clean rooms and comfortable bedding. In fact, I would have given the staff members my remaining 4 x 500 starpoints codes.if I hadnt forgot about them at home. Highly recommended.Thank you very much for the review. We are pleased to hear we exceeded your expectations and you enjoyed the comfort of your room. Are staff are among our best assets and we are thrilled to hear they made your stay pleasant. Thanks again for your kind words.
The service and room were very nice. The room was quite and clean and had comfortable seating. The shower was modern and also very clean. I loved that they provided ear plug on the night stands. I did not need them here but they came in handy at other hotels later in our travels. The hotel was close to the Space Needle and the other attraction near there but not close to Pike's Place Market and other downtown restaurants and shops. If you don't mind a walk or grabbing other transportation, this hotel is a good value.Thank you for your review. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. We do strive to provide a great hotel at a great rate and we are pleased to hear you appreciated the value. We hope to welcome you back the next time you are in Seattle!
The hotel is located just a few blocks from the Seattle Center. It's basically like most other Four Points hotels. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms have a good size are clean and have comfortable beds. Overall not bad really.Dear Ralf, Thank you for taking the time to write your review of our property, your comments are very much valued. We really appreciate your comments regarding our location of our hotel, our staff, the rooms and it's value. We hope that the next time you are in Seattle that you will stay here at the Four Points by Sheraton Downtown Seattle!
I was double charged !!! And the staff acknowledged this, but have done nothing to debit me back for the night I did not stay here. I wouldve given this property a perfect score, the family and i loved our room and the location. However, I am hesitant to stay here ever again for fear the hotel will just decide to make whatever fraudulent charges to my account without my permission and for nights i did Not stay there. To top that off. This shouldve been something they credited me back asap, i shouldnt still be waiting for the money in my account days and days later, i dont appreciate how slow its taking the hotel to decide to refund me and get back to me, this made me negative in my account and accumulated bank fees. And not once has the hotel offered to compensate for the charges their mistake has made on my account and will continue to make until they put the money back into my account.
Went there for business, it wasn't the first hotel choice I had but it's what I ended up with.Rooms were very nice, fitness center had plenty of equipment, breakfast was excellent (received free vouchers for that, not sure if they always give those out), had a nice Wednesday happy hour (wing, BBQ, and drinks). The staff was friendlier and responsive than most places I've stayed.Walking distance to the Space Needle.There was a lot of construction and traffic in the area at the time I stayed, but it wasn't a major inconvenience.Thank you for your kind words about your recent stay. We are so happy to hear that your time with us exceed your expectations, and that you were able to take advantage of our Best Brews BBQ! We hope business brings you back to Seattle soon and that you are able to stay with us again.
Was pleasantly surprised about the level of comfort I found at this place for this low price. Beautifully renovated property in great location. Bar/Lounge on the ground floor and courtyard are very inviting and give you a homey feeling. I loved the new design. Very well done transformation from drab Choice Hotel this used to be. Will sure come back! Staying in a newly renovated property so close from everything at this low price - can't beat that. Lastly, there's a great little Thai restaurant called Bahn Thai just one block away.
For the price the Four Points is very nice. Bathrooms look like they had just been remodeled very clean. We stayed in two different rooms that were equally as clean. One room that night before we left on the cruise and then another room when we came back from our cruise. The staff was very helpful and friendly
I was surprised at how nice and cheap this hotel was. A friend and I stayed just one night for a girls night out in Seattle. It was a last minute booking and I was surprised at the cost so my expectations were not high. They upgraded us to a suite without us asking, it was great, clean and comfy.We're delighted to hear you enjoyed your girls' night. Thanks for sharing your feedback. We hope to welcome you back soon!
I was here a month ago for a business meeting for 3 nights. Somehow my points dint transfer to my account and their was no record of it Really! The hotel is nice looking and food was okay not great. And parking should be free. Paying 15 bucks a night is redundant. There is no curtsey whats so ever...... Not coming here anymore or any four Points.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We strive to make all of our guests feel welcome, so we regret to hear about your experience. Your feedback is important to us and we want to make this right. Please reach out to me so I can make sure you receive your Starpoints and so we can discuss your review further. John, GM Four Points by Sheraton Seattle, john.markfourpointsseattle.com
I wanted to tell the manager wow that was a noisey toilet, wow that was a noisey heater! My room didn't have light canceling shades! There were towel setups for two guests and we stayed in a two bedroom suite. Having said all of that the room was nice and big. With a little thought it could be a nice place to stay.
This was a great hotel to stay in. We upgraded to a suite which was very comfortable. The room had a great view from the 24th floor. It was a corner suite. The only down side was the tower we were located in was not where the concierge suit was. We has to go down to the lobby and then walk across the lobby to the other tower. The good news was the room was ready at 11:30am when our east coast flight arrived in Seattle. This was a plus due to time zone differences.
A clean, well-run hotel in a great location for exploring the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle or walking to Seattle Center or downtown. I also found the staff particularly helpful and accommodating.Thank you kindly for taking the time to leave a positive comment regarding your stay!We do love our location and the nearby Iconic attractions like the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. I hope the next time you are in Seattle that you will stay with us again!
The rooms were good and clean, and so were the bathroom. I wished if they had any refrigerator in the room. Staff was very helpful. The breakfast options were disappointing. No omelettes and they charged 1 for every addition to scrabbled eggs. I had to pay 3 extra to get onions, peppers and tomatoes added to my scrabbled eggs. Except this, the experience was great. I loved the fireplace opposite the reception.Thank you for your kind comments about our great rooms and hotel staff. I am sorry about your experience in the restaurant options. We hope it wont keep you from coming back the next time you are in Seattle!
This hotel is a great place for business or vacation. The staff is friendly, the rooms are your typical Four Points rooms - standard for the Four Points brand. The suites are really nice, but not worth the extra money as the standard rooms include a small sitting area and a large desk that spans the long wall. The Wednesday night grill they include with the local brews deal is more than enough to make a dinner out of as well. Underground parking is really nice during the cold and rainy months. Within walking distance to the needle, but not near Pike's Market at all, would have to drive to get to that and parking downtown near that area is pretty expensive.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on our hotel. We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay at our hotel and that you found our staff to be friendly. Its also great you were able to take advantage of our Wednesday night Best Brews BBQ evening reception. Our convenient location is not only walking distance to the Space Needle, but there is alternate transportation available to and from Pikes Market and the downtown business district, such as Monorail. Plus, our front desk is always happy to help arrange local transportation. These alternative transportation options may be less expensive than parking downtown depending, of course, on how long one plans to stay. Thanks again and we hope to see you soon. Take care.
The best part of the hotel is probably the bar/restaurant staff. Leslie in the bar is fantastic! She was attentive, social, and just really on her job with a great attitude to boot.Unfortunately, Leslie can't work everyday. We met the other bartender on our last night and it was a horrible experience. The breakfast staff was good. The food in the restaurant was much better than expected. The location is great (minus the construction).The front desk staff was mediocre at best. While they were nice...nothing was above par.Your feedback is much appreciated. Were disappointed to hear that your experience in the restaurant was less than par on your last night. We have brought this to the attention of our bartenders and front desk associates to ensure they all deliver consistent quality service to our guests. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you choose us again.
Great place, walking distance to good food and the Space Needle. there's a few run down buildings around the hotel but I never felt unsafe. A+ bartender too! Would definitely recommend staying here!!!
The Four Points was a great hotel choice for my family of 4. We booked online through their website using a AAA discount and scored a two-bedroom suite with a mini kitchenette for about 240 a night. The suite was spacious, and having a coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator made our stay in Seattle feel like staying at home. The lobby and my suite were clean, modern and renovated. The beds are comfortable -- even the convertible sofabed in the living room. The hotel is located a little less than a half mile north of the Seattle Center where the Space Needle, EMP museum and Pacific Science Center. My family had a great time in that area. The location is in what I'd consider a developing area. It's not touristy it's near a few auto shops, a business plaza and a few blocks from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We felt perfectly safe walking in the evening and there are plenty of eating options, like a nice Pho Viet Anh and the corner QFC market which is open 24 hours.We took the monorail for 2.50 each way to get to Pike Place. That walk was a bit much for my 5 year old, so we took a taxi the next time and paid about 15-20, I believe. We stayed there for 3 days before the cruise, and I would be glad to stay there again. If you can afford it, you might want to stay closer to the Downtown area or Pike Place, but if you're looking for an affordable, spacious, comfortable and clean place, you might want to consider this place.
There are two big reason I stayed at this hotel. First that it was walking distance to the Washington State Convention Center. However there was a very step hill going down up before arriving there. Need to be in somewhat of good shape. Second was the price was the best for the location to the near the convention center. The trade off for the price, is this is an older hotel. The bathroom is very small, with a small door way. The room I had was a good size, and had a kitchenette. The room was very clean internet was free. The only problem I had with the room was the refrigerator was leaking on the floor, which made the room smell odd on the second day, and carpet wet. I should told the management.I will probably stay there again again next year, because of the price location.Hi Traveler - Thanks so much for your kind review. We always enjoy our convention guests and hope you enjoyed Seattle during your stay! Please come back and visit us again soon! Safe travels!
I try to frequent locally / family owned businesses. This is a GREAT find and highly reccommend it ! The rooms are fairly priced and talk about well taken care of. The room was immaculant. Neat and clean as a pin, in excellent repair and working order. The inside and outside was well maintained and looked as if the placed... More
It was very clean and much less expensive than other hotels on the way to Yellowstone. There is a Shopko/grocery/liquor store right across the street! Decor is what I would call shabby chic. A little worn but very homey. I will stay here again anytime I'm driving out west.
Friendly small older motel. Friendly staff, very good rates - no breakfast, ice or many amenities, but comfortable enough. AC was a bit iffy, but we managed to get it so we could sleep without being too stuffy. Beds were so-so. We recommend it though, so much better than the overpriced motels nearby.
I almost stayed at one of the large hotels at the edge of Douglas but this place has a retro appeal. When I checked in and the owner told me the price for a night I became concerned that the room would be a dump. My concern was wrong. The room was very nice! This place is a great value... More
I travel quite often for business, this is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. They were very helpful to me and my family. Went above and beyond when they didn't have too. I would highly recommend this hotel.
service was good, all needs attended to in a timely manner, breakfasts were good, Mr. Charles in a fine host.
The beds and pillows were so comfortable, I fell asleep almost as soon as my head hit the pillow. The shower Pressure was very relaxing.
We stayed here for 3 days the last week of March.I was visiting my cousin in Sierra Vista and we had no idea there was so much to do near here.The staff was very cordial and upbeat ,two free drinks a day beer,wine,soft drinks,water.We missed the free dinner Monday-Thursday but the breakfast was a notch above a continental breakfast eggs,sausage,bacon etc.The rooms all have a stove ,full size fridge and microwave.You must visit Kartchner Caverns if you do nothing else.Bisbee is another side trip for a good walk and great food and its quirky shops and bars.Dear Brian F,Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review! We are very happy that you enjoyed your stay here with us and that you found plenty fun things to do in the area. We appreciate all of your feedback and we hope you get a chance to visit s again soon. Have a wonderful day! J-Ebare
We had an exceptional experience at the Metro Atrium. My family of 5 was scheduled to arrive for my nephews wedding at a nearby venue, and were immediately accommodated when we asked to check in earlier due to an impending storm. The room was a...More
I was pleasantly surprised at the room with a king size bed, it was lovely, everything is modernized. I had to stay in my room a lot, there was an extra chair and coffee table to sort out my things. The coffee maker was great, (like a Kreig,) and the staff were very helpful, and greeted me when I returned. Extra pillows and an ironing board, microwave were appreciated too.
Great location to businesses, shopping and highway. Comfortable with excellent staff. I was there on business and it worked out great. Excellent breakfast and fast internet.Deborah, Were glad our hotel made your business trip a little bit easily to be away from your love ones. We take pride in our customer service and work very hard to make every guest feel at home at the Wingate Brand locations. Please feel free to contact us on your next visit to the Atlanta area. Willis Blake DOS
This is an awesome hotel. The employees was the bomb. The pool was inside and it was very nice and warm. Our children did not want to get out. The breakfast and the staff was on point at all times. When we go back to GA this will be our hotel. Thanks for everything.Robin, Were glad you and your family enjoyed our indoor pool and breakfast staff. Our summer season is very busy but we strive to make every guest feel good about our location and their stay. Please feel free to contact our location on your next summer visit to Atlanta.

We traveled a tremendous amount of distance by car to get to the hotel. We had an important family event in Smyrna. The hotel location is great for people coming from out of town. The stay was pretty good - the beds were comfortable. Breakfast was tasty although it would have been nice to provide turkey products for those who do not eat pork. The workout equipment was outdated and in need of repair. The manual in the room did not advertise tourist attractions.All staff were courteous. Room was nice, but doors, walls, and handles were filthy. The kitchenette needed cleaning as well. Nonetheless we were quite pleased with the comfort and quaintness of the room. Again, the location was phenomenal.
Overall this was a very good hotel stay. The room was clean and everything worked. Check the online price versus the price when you call. I got the room 35 cheaper by booking online through the Wyndham site. Hello 406eltong,WOW! Thanks for all the compliments. I have shared your review with my staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience. We look forward to serving you again in the future.Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
The pool and hot tub was filthy. Tried to call front desk and was unable to reach anyone about it.I apologize your stay with us was not a pleasant one. I have shared your comments with the entire staff so we can address concerns such as yours to make sure we do a better job in delivering a great experience.
The parking here is a bit tight and I was constantly looking out my window to check my car. The only close restaurant is an Apple Bees and it was so loud in there I got my food to go. The breakfast was ok. The bed was nice and the new carpet was good. The water pressure in the shower could have been batter.Greg, Sorry about your water pressure in your room. I checked with my maintenance staff on the level of our water pressure in the room. I opened up the shower in several rooms and have good water pressure. Please contact our front desk staff if your water pressure is low we have a maintenance person on-call 24 hours a day. Please feel free to give us an opportunity to keep your business at our location for your next trip.Willis Blake DOS
The room was a great size, updated and nice. The shower/tub was dirty, and the pool area was nasty, The kids wanted to swim ( which is why we booked this hotel... for its indoor pool) , but the pool was nasty and the hot tub had what looked like sand all in the bottom of it. The chlorine was so strong, we could not even stay.Dear 874reginab,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff and Housekeeping staff to ensure that it is not repeated. Cleanliness is our main priority so for you to experience this inconvenience while you stayed with us is unacceptable. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for any inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call. We look forward to having you as our guest in the future.ThanksTremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
We stayed in room 406 on Friday night, 11/10/17. I could tell they were doing renovations on the rooms for that floor, and was initially worried about the smell of paint that I noticed on the way to our room. However, as we got closer to the room the smell dissipated and it didn't seem at the time that it was going to be an issue. The room we had was clean, and accommodations were in good shape all around. The night auditor did a great job getting us checked in and setup. Got up early Saturday morning, went to Ikea and then lunch. Returned to the hotel around 2:30PM, and they were painting about 4 of the rooms on our floor. The hallway was filled with a mist of paint from the sprayers, and the smell was awful. I've renovated houses before and I'm no stranger to paint fumes, but I can honestly say that after about 15 minutes in the room I was having a headache and my pregnant wife absolutely did not want to spend another minute in the room. So, I went downstairs to request another room. Leonard was our customer rep, and informed us that the hotel was in fact overbooked, and there were no other rooms we could move to. Ultimately, we decided to check out and go to the La Quinta down the street. Now, this could have turned into a disaster, but Leonard did a great job of turning this around. They did not charge us for the remainder of our stay, and actually gave us a 50 discount on the one night that we did spend in the hotel. He never argued once, was sincere the entire time, and was apologetic about the inconvenience. This is the only reason we will come back to the hotel - someone actually cared about what was going on and they did right and tried to fix it. There's never a great time to renovate a hotel, but a genuine customer advocate is always a welcome change!I apologize for the experience you had during your stay, this is never the impression we like to leave with our guest. I ensure you this is not the way we conduct business or coach our staff on interacting with guest. This review has been forwarded to management and this matter will be discussed, using your review as a reference. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and very important to us, I thank you for taking time out to write us, you can bet, if you ever return that what happened to you will never happen again. Thank you for your Loyalty and I hope you allow us another opportunity to host you and yours again in the future!
There are many options in this area but the Wingate is great. Diane will check you in and Sly will cook your breakfast. Everyone will treat you like a treasured guest.

I have shared your review with the entire staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience. We cant wait to see you the next time around.Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
Housekeeping said it was a trick, after our third attempt we asked for another room. They were very friendly and helpful at the front desk. We changed rooms unfortunately the second room had the same problem but a little easier to get in. We settled for that room. We didnt want to move again. Thank you for your feedback, as it is very important to us. We will take note of the concerns regarding this review and attempt to correct these if possible. We are all about improving the quality of everyones visit, including adding some specials touches. We hope you chose us again on your next visit to the area.
I love the young lady personallity that check me in. Even though it was her last day! I hope yall found someone like herThank you so much for all of your feedback jacquitam2017. All your concerns are important to us! I will definitely share this information with my entire staff. The Wingate by Wyndham hotel is looking forward for to your next visit to Atlanta please feel free to contact us for any request!Tremeil B.Assistant Manager
The hotel itself as well as our room was nice and clean, staff was very, very friendly, but the location of the hotel is not very convenient to get to if you're coming off the interstate because you have to go up and do a U-turn and come back down to the entrance, but that still was not a big deal. The only complaint that I have is how nasty the bathroom was. The shower definitely had not been cleaned prior to us staying there. There were hairs ALL OVER the shower walls and the tub. It was completely disgusting!!Thank you for all of your feedback kristia319. Reviews such as this help us identify where we can do a better job. I have pass this information along to our staff, so they will know what we can do to improve. Again, I appreciate the time it took to write this review. We hope you'll give us another chance when you are in the area. Gratefully,Wingate by Wyndham
Over all the hotel was great. my only problem was that we were in a room on the ground floor next to the elevator. We could not go to sleep until around 2:00am because every time someone used the elevator we could here it. We even turned the fan to continuous to have some constant noise. Then we got woke up at 6:00am with the elevator again.Dear Mr. Dwayne T, Thank you for staying at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. We appreciate you sharing your experience with us. Direct feedback from our customers, both good and bad is the most valuable advice we can receive. It helps us to recognize our areas of challenges and make the appropriate adjustments where necessary. The Wingate by Wyndham is definitely looking forward your next visit to Atlanta!Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
The service was good. The staff was friendly. The rooms nice and clean. Breakfast was good. The computer and the internet worked very well but the computer was in the main lobby... should be in a separate room for a little privacy. The only negative thing I have to say is that they ran out of face towels Also staff did not mention anything about the rewards programTracy, On behalf of our staff were glad you stayed at our location for your visit to the Atlanta area. We were doing some upgrading to our Business Center doing your stay. Our Business Center will be located across from the Front Desk in an enclosed private area in July. Tracy sorry my staff did not sign you up for Wyndham Rewards doing your stay. Please feel free to come back and stay at our location in the near future.Willis Blake DOS
Veronica was very helpful. She searched and found my reservation and secured a room for me. She was pleasant and greeted me by name when I approached the receptionist desk. I felt at home. Dear jdbrownattorney, Thank you so much for all of your feedback. I have shared your review with the entire staff at the Wingate by Wyndham. The Wingate hotel looks forward to you visiting us again. Remember you can Count on Us!!!Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
My husband and I visited Atlanta, and just finished our 5 night stay at this hotel. They overbooked, so our double was upgraded to a king suite. Score!The location was good, right off 75. There was a mall, Walgreen's and several restaurants nearby. And you can't beat free parking, wireless and breakfast - and a microwave and small fridge in the room!Unfortunately, I have to give them a lower rating for the room itself. We were a little lost at first because our room did not have a number posted. After a little walking up and down the hall at 10:30PM, we figured it out. The room had a funky smell. Not really bad, just smelled weird. It was much more humid in our room than the rest of the hotel. I think the room air conditioning unit was not working properly. Cable did not work, so we could not watch TV (Not really a bad thing, who wants to watch TV on vacation anyway So we never called to have it fixed). The bathtub faucet dripped constantly. There was lots of trash under and around the bed - paper towels shoved between under the headboard, between the wall and mattress, bits of paper and wrappers, a wooden coffee stir stick. The entire time there it was never cleaned out. Some liquid had been splashed on the headboard and dried. That was also never cleaned off. The cherry on top was I went to use one of the new wash cloths replaced by housekeeping, and found a hair stuck in it that clearly did not belong to me or my husband.FYI elevators can be a little scary - very slow to open! We never got stuck, but there were a few times I was not so sure...It was OK for the price we paid, but I wouldn't stay there again. Next time we will try another hotel in the area.
I had a great experience at this s property as the room was very nice, the staff was excellent and the breakfast was put together very well. I will defenitley be coming back.We are thrilled our Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria exceeded your expectations ThomasH35091! It is great to read that you were impressed with our friendly associates who took great care of you. It was a pleasure having you as our guest, and we look forward to your next visit with us soon.Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
I was in town for training, I booked the room here because of the location and the other hotels in my price range where booked. My room was clean and roomy, but the property is a bit rundown. I had an issue with my door lock being tough to open. I told the front desk about it, but it was never resolved. Their breakfast is a bit sparse and cheap. I mean you can see through the strips of bacon, the eggs where rubbery and the sausage was chewy as well. I asked about oatmeal that I usually have and was told that no they didn't have. If you get a room on the second floor ask for the number before you go up. 216 to 224 are over the indoor pool. They can get noisy if there are any children staying there. I wasn't aware about the homeless population in the area, but I did get an uncomfortable feeling about the area. While nothing happened during my stay, i would keep it in mind. There where a lot of things that just didn't work, ice machine on my floor wasn't working, the thermostat in my room just didn't work right, the waffle machine, several lights in the hallway, and several window screens where out or hanging from the windows. Over all it is Rough Around the Edges.On behalf of our Management team thank you for taking the time for post your feedback on Trip Advisor. Your comments will be posted and discussed in our Management staff meeting on Friday. Our hotel takes all our customers comments and feedback on Trip advisor very serious. Our hotel Management team will check each incident very carefully. Thanks again for taking the time to post your comments. Our number one objective at the Wingate is guest satisfaction.Willis Blake DOS
I reserved this hotel to participate at a meeting in downtown. Very good hotel with large room, clean and good breakfast. There is a pool a gym and wireless working very good. Free parking. The hotel is near to many shopping centers and also to highway. I spend there good time.Thank you for your comments on Trip Advisor while attending a meeting in Atlanta. Please feel free to contact us on your next trip to Atlanta. Willis Blake
The hotel staff were very friendly and capable. Our room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located to shops, restaurants, and the highway, but very difficult to access from the road you have to go down several blocks and turn around and come back instead of being able to turn in directly from the road. My main issue was that the room was not very clean. The towels and bathroom floor both contained hair that didn't belong to any of us there were visible stains and debris on the bathroom floor and candy wrappers on the floor under the desk, and what looked like ground-in food on the desk chair.Dear LCF22974,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback.

I normally travel quite a bit and because of a meeting I was attending I decided to stay at the hotel that was hosting it. This is the second time I've been so disappointed with my room. Everything was so dirty . Sink, shower, hair dryer .... so very disappointing. This was my second time staying in a Wyndham and both times I've been very displeased with my experience.
I just wanted to say that my family and I stayed there about a week ago and we were so impressed with the customer service skills from Staci, she did everything from making sure we had extra towels and face cloths in the room because thats what we noted in our reservation, checking us in early, she called us once we got in the room and settled to make sure the room was okay. She printed out directions every time we needed them and she was just a joy to talk with. She is really good at her position. The hotel overall was excellent and we will definitely return.On behalf of our front office staff we want to thank you for staying at our location. Stacey is one of our best employees. Our Count on Me Wyndham Culture was built on taking care of the guest needs. We believe at the Wingate that our customers pay our salaries and deserve to be served as guests. Please feel free to stay at our location on your next visit to Atlanta.Willis Blake DOS
This is the third year I am staying at the Wingate, Cobb Drive in Atlanta, over the period of the same conference.The hotel needs a little renovation, but the VALUE for money, and the SIZE of the rooms, can't be beaten!However, the one thing I want to really compliment this year, is the Service by staff generally, and one person in Particular. The receptionist VERONICA is an amazing lady. Walking into the hotel yesterday after being away for 12 months, I was greeted like an old friend, welcoming me back. A smiling face and bright disposition really makes a difference, after what was an 800 mile drive from DC!Veronica is amazing, and really went out of her way to accommodate me in the PERFECT room for my stay of 5 nights.Thank you Veronica! Your outstanding and excellent service is appreciated more than you can imagine!Dear YCDBSOYA,Thanks for all of your feedback. I have shared your review with my staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience. We look forward to serving you again in the future.Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
I really enjoyed the stay in the king suite. It was clean and the bed slept so good. Breakfast was also delicious especially the make your own waffles. Most importantly, this property was affordable and a great value. I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want to leave the room.Dear 216tiaw,Thanks for all of your feedback. I have shared your review with the entire staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience.

Hotel clean and comfortable and very good customer service. Easy access to major highways. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby.
Stay was ok ,my problem was when trying to contact general Mgr she never returned my call . We were looking to stay another week and I retch out to to see if we could receive a discounted rate considering we had already stayed 4 days

This was a great hotel for the price. It was just on the outskirts of Atlanta. Everything we needed was in the area.
Good location, friendly staff. Room was nice and bed was comfortable. Internet was slow so watching TV was difficult, and working on a computer from the room was impossible.

I have shared your review with my staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience. Thanks for letting us as a staff to Make it Right.

I literally stayed for a night because I was too tired to continue driving. The point of me stopping was to get sleep. I was next to a room full of kids screaming, jumping off of things and banging against the wall. I called three times to room service. All three times he came up to speak with the children. Needless to say I didn't get any rest. I called and left a message for the manager and still have yet to have heard from him. This shouldn't even get a star Please accept my personal apologies for the inconvenience you experienced with your hotel stay at our Wingate brand location. Although your experience with us has not been a good one, we hope that youwill offer us the opportunity to provide you with our hospitality on your next trip. Thank you for taking the time to let us know of this situation. We do apologize and look forward to serving you in the future.Sincerely,Willis Blake DOS
I booked the Jacuzzi Suite. The price was reasonable for such a room. At first they gave me a regular suite but when i went back to tell them, they apologized and promptly showed me to the right room. The staff was very friendly and inviting. The room was very clean and everything that i was expecting. The Jacuzzi tub was great. The king size bed was amazing and i slept very well. A much needed relaxation after a long drive. The only thing that i really didn't have the best experience with was the fitness room. A couple of the machines didn't work but that's not too big of a deal. Would definitely stay again.Dear donovang937,Thanks for all the compliments. I have shared your review with my staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience. We look forward to serving you again in the future.Thanks Tremeil BooneWingate by Wyndham
Hotel was clean and staff were friendly and helpful. We did have a unique experience while staying here. We arrived at our room at the same time as another guest and found the clerk had assigned us and the other guest to the same room (427). Front desk fixed the problem. Later that night, around 10PM, someone tried to enter our room. They could not as the deadbolt was set. Called the front desk and was informed they had assigned our room to another guest as they had no record of it being assigned to us. We had left the room for a couple of hours to attend a Braves game and were glad they had not done this prior to our return
Everything was great with check in, staff, room, and price. The only thing worth mentioning is the furniture carpet needs updating.
Rooms wasn't cleaned hair was ever where on the desk and table. Yall need someone to check behind the maids! Simple as that. Thought it was nicer for the location wasn't pleased at all and will never stay there again.We are truly sorry to hear that you did not have a pleasant stay with us. I will address all of the issues that you stated with our staff so that we can make improvements. We really appreciate your feedback and will use it to make sure that future guests have a much better experience.
Booked a single room with 2 beds. Upon. Checking in the person at the front desk not only informed me that she was putting me in a single King, but that they didn't have any rooms available for the type of room booked. I asked for a refund since this reservation was made over a week in advance. Desk clerk was very rude, refused a refund.

The location can be a little aggravating getting into from the direction I come from my only real complaint what's the hotel was extremely hot in the lobby and then the hallways the staff was very friendly though the best part about this stay was I was able to walk two SunTrust Park overall a nice hotelDear V4564NVpatrickl, WOW! Thank you for all of your compliments. I have shared your review with my staff just to show them how important everyone on the team is to creating a great guest experience.

Overall, it was your average hotel room. I feel like I could've stayed at a super 8 and got the same room and level of service.
Hi, I had to change two rooms due to the dust and the nastiness of the rooms. The third room sink was stopped up, but I got tired of changing rooms. I will not recommend the Wingate on Cobb Pkwy to anyone.
I was very disappointed with the breakfast.... Food was not good. The room did not cleaned on the first night and on the second day before checkout time - was awakening by housekeeping... When asked the front desk why the room was not cleaned the first day - was told short on help!!!! wowDear wesleym252,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback.

Hotel stay was ruined 1) the pool closed on the 2nd day due to child's toilet accident. Hotel staff then shocked the pool, and opened it several hours later. However, 2) no warning sign was put out to inform guests that shocked indoor pools are dangerous for people with respiratory problems. Had to end stay at Hotel early due to sudden severe respiratory problems that developed at the pool on 2nd day. My Dr. later informed me that the chemicals in the air from the shocked pool caused my respiratory problems. Hotel also put, unknown 115 charge on our CC after we left, even though we used our Wyndam Rewards points. Manager of hotel failed to respond to written complaints left at the desk. General Manager failed to return several phone calls in a timely manner, and finally told us that Wyndham did not do anything wrong It was a CYA response. Our vacation was ruined. I had to have 7 Rxs filled + Emergency visit to my Dr. who felt I might need to go to the ER. No cleaning staff ever came to our room to clean it.Hello dalef565,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel, the pool was in working condition. The incident that happened we did have to take the correct protocol by shocking the pool to insure that no one is harmed by the chemical or the bile. We did check all pool levels and tested the water before allowing anyone in the pool. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff to ensure that we change the look of our hotel. We do care as a staff about every situation that goes on at our hotel good or bad. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel.

I spent 7 nights here under 2 reservations with my first night added just a week before my trip and the other 6 nights were booked months in advance. Both reservations were for a Standard Room, 1 King Bed. However, on check in I was...More
I can't remember which Wingate we stayed at but we came through Florida toward Indy and it was right off that route. This hotel was clean, very friendly but extremely noisy at night. The highway traffic was really bad on a Thursday night during Spring Break. However the hotel room itself was wonderful! It had 2 separate bedrooms with tvs for each, a kitchen area and a computer area plus free breakfast for under 100. It didn't seem to be a crappy part of town either. Would recommend it but not on spring break. Starbucks is just 2 blocks down - bonus.
First of all we actually picked wrong location thinking where we had stayed previously. The other was at another exit. However, we checked in and went to our room and started to settle in. At some point in the evening my wife went to her side of the bed. There was a substance like a gel on the glass table by the bed. She pulled a Kleenex and wiped it all of. She plugged in phone/Ipad for charging and in moving away from bed noticed a condom wrapper on the floor. We decided to just deal with it. My wife told the girl at the front desk when we were going out to dinner. She offered to move us, but at our age it was more trouble than it was worth. We just explained that perhaps they should let cleaning staff responsible for that room that day of the findings. Was really surprised and disappointed. Dear Mr. Harold:Please accept my sincere apology regarding your recent stay at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. Mr. Harold, what you experienced is not the standard we strive to uphold. We have reviewed our procedures and made appropriate changes to prevent this from occurring in the future. We look forward to having you as a guest with our BRAND in the future. Again, I am sorry for the inconvenience. Please contact me personally for your next reservation at our Wingate.With appreciation,Willis Blake DOS
Upon arrival we meet Veronica, a woman with a beautiful smile, showed professional posture and when beyond the call of duty to make our stay with a feeling of opulence. My husband and I have a certain proclivity towards Wingate by Wyndham rather than other hotels during the Atlanta Jewelry Shows.Dear Mr. Jim M, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback. I will definitely share this information with my entire staff.The Wingate by Wyndham hotel is looking forward for to your next visit to Atlanta please feel free to contact us for any request.Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
The stay was good but the TV didnt work right. It was very agrevating. Sound and picture was not in sync. Wasnt just in my room it seemed to be a universal problem. We had more than one room with the same issue. Had a leaky tub but the issued was resolved while i was in classDear dannywS45671I, Thank you for your feedback on your recent stay with us.

Nice, clean, spacious room and bath! Stayed for a conference at the Cobb Galleria. Access in and out was good. Great breakfast!Dear margaretj43, We are thrilled our Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria exceeded your expectations for an outstanding stay. It is great to read that you were impressed with our friendly associates who took great care of you and with our convenient location to the Cobb Galleria Center. It was a pleasure having you as our guest, and we look forward to your next visit with us soon!Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
The staff was superb!! The room, however, was not. It was extremely noisy it was not as clean as it should have been and there were several repairs that should have been made. As an example, one side of the commode was not attached to the floor properly, so when you leaned, the commode went with you! Plus, the safe was locked, so we were not able to use it while there.
I went to stay at this hotel and ordered a jacuzzi suite which is suppose to be one of the nicest of their rooms. I go in the rook is huge. It looks nice but as the day goes on I kill at least 8 stink bugs, the bugs that emit a disgusting smell when killed. I use the jacuzzi tub and one of the jets do not work some of the towles have this yellow residue on it and the tub wasnt completely clean. I check out today to find out they charged me 150 dollars because I left some tobacco in the trash which they institute as smoking. I make my own cigarettes so sometimes I do not use all of the tobacco but if I wouldve known I would be charged 150 dollars for leaving tobacco around I would have never went to this hotel. I did not smoke in the room at all and i know it smells nothing like smoke so I do not understand what constitutes the charge of 150 dollars. The general manager was not there so I have to wait until Monday.Our entire hotel is non-smoking. We do charge one hundred and fifty dollars when a guest smokes in the room. We did have several smoking area around the hotel so our guest can smoke outside.Willis Blake DOS
This hotel is in a great locations and was excellent for the price. Right next to the Gallaria. Doug, Were glad you stayed at our location while attending an event at the Cobb Galleria Center.

Please feel free to stay with our Wingate Brand locations in the near future.Willis Blake DOS
Excellent service. Clean room. Comfy bed. No hassle reservation, check-in and check-out. Exercise room left a little to be desired - only 4 machines total which included one treadmill. Indoor pool was excellent.Dear Caronl2017, Thanks for all of your feedback.

I was unhappy with the service for the room. One nite I had to go to the front desk for shampoo etc. because none were restocked. Then I get ready to shower and no washcloths. Were there.

My husband and I stayed here with 49 other seniors with Coffee Break Tours. This was a great place. We were in room 420 overlooking the parking lot. It was a spacious room with new carpeting, lounge chair w/foot stool, desk, flat screen TV, lots of space with deep dresser. We had a microwave and refrigerator which was an added plus. There was a granite top area with a coffee maker, etc. King size bed with very comfortable bedding. It was all spotless. Nice bath with a large granite vanity, tub/shower combo was immaculate. Great lighting and a good a/c system. The breakfast area in the lobby was spacious. All the regular breakfast items available and the breakfast attendant made sure everything was cleaned up after people left the table. Jennifer was at the desk on this Sat. morning and she was a delight. Very polite, efficient, and thanked us for staying at the hotel. This was one of our better stays. Thanks for making us so comfortable.Thanks for the wonderful compliments! It sure made Jennifer happy to see she was mentioned for her customer service skills! If you're ever in the area again - come back to see us. Willis Blake DOS
Nice hotel, it just needed a deep cleaning. The wall under the bathroom sink was dirty and they didn't move the nightstand to vaccuum (found babyfood under it when I dropped my phone charger behind it). Everything else was rather nice, I'm just rather particular.Dear josepht474,Thank you for staying at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. We appreciate you sharing your experience with us.

Most important -- very comfortable and clean beds. Amenities lacking in that there was only one (1) tissue in the box of kleenex and 1/2 roll of toilet paper on roll.Another concern is that there was only one chair in the room - a desk chair. We were two adults so only place for one of us to sit was on the bed. Would prefer to have at least two sitting spaces, not on the beds. When to breakfast 8:00 a.m. rather slim pickings. Egg server empty and never refilled between 8 and 9. Yogurt case nearly empty, not refilled, Extremely minimal offerings on continental breakfast. Desk staff quite efficient and pleasant. Cost of room appropriate. Basically ok visit NOT outstanding or above average.
It was great to include the small gym. My only complaint was with breakfast. If you offer service until 9am. Then it should remain fully stocked until 9am not short the main items: eggs, bacon, and sausage.When I asked at 8:45 if they bring out more eggs, bacon or sausage I was told no because it was too close to 9am.William Thank you for taking the time to express your feeling regarding your stay at our location. Our free daily breakfast is a great selling point for our customers. I will meet with my staff on Friday and review your comments and concerns. Please feel free to contact us on your next trip to the Atlanta market.Willis Blake DOS
Yes the receptionist was very professional, and upon enterence into the hotel it was nice and the breakfast was good. However I choose this hotel because of the name and it did not meet the standards that I'm use to when staying at a Wingate Hotel and for the price it truely did not match. The pictures looked better online than in person. The door to the hotel room did not open properly, the toilet was very loose and when me or the kids sat on it, it shook - the tub was not properly cleaned so we used the towels to put down on the bottom of the tub. The money I spent on the room did not match the quality of the hotel's name which is why I choose it. For what we got we could have stayed at a motel 6 for a approximately half the price. The computer really sits by the front door and not in a computer room.The location was O.K.Please accept my sincere apology regarding your recent stay at the BRAND of Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. Teyonna what you experienced is not the standard we strive to uphold. We have reviewed our procedures and made appropriate changes to prevent this from occurring in the future. We look forward to having you as a guest with our Wingate BRAND in the future. Again, I am sorry for the inconvenience. Please contact me personally for your next reservation at our hotel.Willis Blake DOS
I took my family here for a four-day stay in the Atlanta area. My husband and I stayed in a King room and our boys stayed in a room next to ours. The staff was friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and the King room was a nice size. Rooms had a microwave and fridge. An average breakfast is included in the stay which was nice. My only complaint is that the hotel is very close to the interstate so we heard some traffic at night. Get a room away from the highway if possible. I give it a high three rating.Serena, Hopefully you enjoyed your four day stay at our location over the Holiday Season. We hope you have a opportunity to come stay with us again in the near future. Thank you for your feedback on our location during your stay. Customers feedback is the only way to improve your stay in the future. Willis Blake DOS

It was difficult to get to. Desk clerk at check in wasn't pleasant seemed like she didn't want to be there. The room was alright plenty of room (jacuzzi suite) but the jacuzzi was misleading was told multiple times it was a 2 person tub when in fact it was not, there was tiles broken in the bathroom and what looked liked repaired water damage on the ceiling. Holes in bathmat, stains on towels, didn't service our room well, bed was not made the first morning, never stocked cups or paper products the whole time. The breakfast was edible but pretty bland, decided to eat out for breakfast after the first morning, but the Saturday breakfast guy was very friendly. Very few tv channels that was disappointing. Bed wasn't all that comfortable tossed and turned each night. 3 night stay, would stay again good rooms for the price paid.CrystalThank you for taking the time to let us know about your concerns with our Wingate BRAND.

Our experience was amazing. Geraldine at the front desk went above and beyond to get us into our room. We traveled in from Philadelphia early in the morning and while many guests were checking out she worked to get us into our room so we would be comfortable. She is an asset to your company.Geraldine is truly a gem. She is a great leader at the front desk and all the guests just love her. We are happy to hear that she made your stay just that much better. We hope you enjoyed the game and that you choose to stay with us again in the future.
The staff were friendly and courteous, the head of house keeping does a great job in making sure the customers are taken care of. The management should think about getting their house keeping department better cleaning solutions for the bathroom tiles are starting to mildew up and there was some black mold starting to form around the top soap dish in the bathroom tubDear Rocky D,Thank you so much for all of your feedback.

I flew in from a deployment to Afghanistan and met my family in Atlanta. We chose the hotel because of its proximity to the stadium. When we got our room we noticed a few problems: the futon bed/sofa had both back legs broken or detached. When my kids sat on it they nearly fell back into the wall. When I told the from desk they just put a roll away bed in the room (which you could feel every spring through). The shower faucet was falling off the wall as well. When I reported to the front desk they just didnt seem to care. When I called down for linen for the toll away bed they told me to come get it myself- because only one worker on duty. Just less than impressed with the stay. Unfortunate because the location is great. Thank you for staying at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria lisadJ4273!

The rooms were great. Breakfast was not well stocked so not much available if you were not there right away! Biggest complaint was both our rooms were not ready at check in! One of them wasn't ready until 5 pm! Not cool after a day of traveling! Dear amyh6751RH, I want to take this opportunity to apologize for the poor service you received during your stay at the BRAND of Wyndham. Your experience with our BRAND was not the quality of service that we have promised to provide to our guests. Our BRAND promise is something that we strive to deliver to every guest every day. There is no excuse that our staff did not fulfill that promise in your case. Please accept our apologies.

I have always stayed at any Wyndham whenever I travel, my experience has always been the best. What made my stay to at this location was the front desk personnel Terry. He was so accommodating. Terry offered details about the city where to go visit....More
Everything was clean, fairly updated, nice. The hotel was easy to get to from 75 and 285. We had a small couch, microwave, and mini fridge. We used the iron, safe, and hair dryer all without hiccups. The king bed in our room was so comfortable- I think memory foam, maybe And the pillows were not just big hard marshmallows but able to be fluffed and shaped a little. Breakfast was decent- scrambled eggs, sausage links, waffles, juice, coffee, cereal, fruit, yogurt, bread and bagels. Our only complaint was that the road noise from 285 was quite noticeable. We had a 4th floor room in the back, on the same end of the building as the pool. I think it would have been even louder on the front of the building though! Also when people flushed their toilets in other rooms, we could hear them. Didn't hear anyone's TVs or voices through the walls. Not sure if that's a function of the hotel or its guests that night though. We would stay here again, but maybe bring ear plugs, or request a different room, or try to run the fan on the heat/ac unit to provide some white noise.Thank you for taking the time to post comments on Trip Advisor about our location.

From the outside the hotel look like a older hotel but inside has totally been updated on the inside. Our room was very clean and was much larger than expected. The bed was comfortable and we had plenty of pillows. There was even and lounge area in our room. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The only thing is that traffic is horrible around there so either use the free shuttle of ride sharing.Dear Mr. Christopher P, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback.

This is an average hotel. We requested a firm bed on line and during check in because of my back problem. The mattresses were broken down and NOT firm. The breakfast was minimal and the milk was past expiration.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for opening day of SunTrust Park. It was the perfect place to stay. We were able to park at the hotel and walk to the game in less than 10 minutes. I would defiantly recommend this hotel to anyone in town for a game. There wasnt any traffic getting to the hotel and the room was bigger than I expected and very clean. Will be staying her again.

This was the third year we have stayed at this particular hotel while attending an event for my daughter. The previous two years were enjoyable stays. This year was terrible. The television and internet did not work most of the weekend. Went down to breakfast and was told there was no juice because they were not prepared for the number of guests. The lobby, walkway in front of the elevators, and dining area were torn up the entire weekend. I am shocked that renovations would be planned during a busy weekend. So very disappointed! Got a great rate, but I guess you get what you pay for.Dear S6674SGamandac,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback.

We wanted a place within walking distance of Blind Willie's and this hotel got the best ratings on Tripadvisor. It was a great place to stay! The room was clean and comfortable, there was good coffee in the morning and it was not only within walking distance of Blind Willie's but the Jimmy Carter Presidential library as well. Would definitely stay here again.Thank you for your wonderful review! We appreciate your feedback and are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay. It would be our pleasure to have you as a guest in the future, please come back soon!Thank you,Kristin AndersonAssistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
I booked at hotels.com for a quick overnight trip for our nephew's graduation. The inn touted itself as a European boutique hotel, but it's really a step up from a hostel. Bare bones. We paid half the fee charged on their website for a double room. Double means just that: double beds. When I called to confirm the day before our trip, I got no answer, so I emailed. The reply from the front desk staff was condescending and rude, and immediately I regretted booking at the Highland Inn. I then discovered that others have complained (if you want link, let me know). It was too late to cancel, so I arrived with trepidation. The room was spartan, the shower was awful, the a/c window units were not very effective, the carpet was old, the fridge was banged up, and the breakfast was paltry. However, the neighborhood was cute (my local relative said it was not that good but I couldn't tell from our brief stay) and it's close to historic midtown (2 miles). The management never contacted me re the rude reception, and my final recommendation is to go somewhere else.Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We take all feedback seriously, and sincerely regret that you did not have a positive experience with us. Currently, we are replacing the window units throughout the hotel with individual heating/cooling units, however, if your unit was not working efficiently we would have been happy to move you and the same goes for the shower. Any time you are not happy with anything during your stay, we are more than happy to help. Upon further investigation, I am having trouble locating the email you spoke of, and it certainly is not in keeping with how we treat our guests. We urge you to contact us directly to discuss. We strive to make our guests stay the best it can be and would be more than happy to address this situation with our staff. Thank you,Kristin Anderson
I had a nice 5-night stay at this hotel. I was originally supposed to stay for 4 nights but my flight got cancelled and the hotel, graciously and without hassle or fanfare, allowed me to stay in my same room for an extra night and for the same nightly rate that I had booked when I was making my original reservation online. My room was located on the ground floor towards the back and the only disturbance was the restaurant next door late in the evenings. However, I'm not a light sleeper so once I went to bed, it didn't bother me at all. The legendary cat greeted me when I was checking in (around midnight) and he allowed me to pet him. I only saw him once more during my stay. This hotel is very well located - there are 2 cafes within 5 minutes walk and another 1 about 20 minutes' walk away - and there's a barbecue place right next door, a diner around the corner and a gourmet pizza place across the street. I sampled them all and was happy with my meals and coffee drinks. The hotel serves a continental breakfast. It's nothing to write home about but it will hold you for a few hours and I liked the convenience of not having to go in search of breakfast first thing in the morning. Ponce City Market is very nearby so there are a tonne more food options within easy reach. My room was well kept and very clean. It looks pretty dated but is very well maintained. My only problem was that the hot water took more than 15 minutes to really get hot and since I'm not a big fan of wasting water, I ended up taking tepid/warm showers most of the time, instead of really hot the way I like it. The staff were helpful when needed but not overly friendly. I had a good stay and I would return to this hotel if I needed to stay in that area again. Oh, and there's a Publix behind the hotel, about a 3 minute walk, which was very convenient when I needed cold medicine.
Stayed here as part of an air - hotel package. The room was perfect except for a very small shower. It was clean and the maid service was good. The neighborhood is awesome, walking distance from many bars and restaurants .
The Inn had so much character . And the staff there were so friendly and helpful. Especially the manager steve H. I definitely will be visiting the Inn again. Loved the entertainment in the Ballroom. The continental breakfast was great
I was in Atlanta overnight for Christmas shopping in December. I stayed again at the Highland Inn as it is a very good location if you are coming into Atlanta off I-75/I-85. I also enjoy its proximity to Whole Foods and good restaurants and coffee shops. It's also an easy trip up to Buckhead with Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza.My room was again very clean and roomy. This Inn has character and the staff have always been helpful on my three stays.
Just stayed here and really enjoyed the hotel. It has a lot of unique charm to offer. It is not your standard hotel ... only those who like something a little different will appreciate this hotel. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The layout of my two bedroom was fun (meaning it wasn't the typical layout - two beds side by side). It was more like two separate rooms adjoined by a door. Overall I really like this unique and charming hotel - would stay again. I really enjoyed the location too.We really appreciate you taking a moment to share your experience. It's always nice to hear when a guest has had a positive experience and appreciates the charm of our inn. I'll be sure to share your kind words with our staff. Please come back and see us again soon!Best wishes, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
I have stayed here 3 time and each time I say to my self I will come back. It's clean they are very nice. each room is very different in a good way.!there is a bar that place music on friday,saturday night and if you get the right room you can here it for free. they did quit fairly early.it is a very friendly Inn!
We stayed her as part of our Honeymoon trip recommended by the local Tourist Board. We were very disappointed on arrival the hotel was built in the early 1900, however they have not spent much money on the property, Carpets were grim and dull and walls and paintwork was cracked , mould and paint peeling off. Bathroom was tiny, while sitting on the loo you were able to rest your head on the wall in front of you. Shower just about dribbled out so you barely got wet. They were working in two rooms with lots of concrete and dust, we were not told this at the time of making our reservation, which was on the day of arrival. The hotel also had an evening event taking place in the ballroom and our room was overlooking part of the courtyard where everyone spilled out to during breaks and when it finished the noise was so bad it was as if we were lying in the middle of a nightclub. We were kept awake after driving over 300 miles and on honeymoon. Breakfast was very limited/basic in fact with very low cost items and plastic plates/cups ect. Not what I would expect having paid over 100Thank you for your review. We try to notify all guests of events in our ballroom and I am sorry that we failed to do so when you checked in. I sincerely regret the disturbance to you and your wife. In the future, if you have any trouble in your room or otherwise, please alert the front desk and we will be happy to move you to a more suitable room. Your feedback is very important to us and appreciated as it helps us to make improvements. Best, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
Very pleased with my stay at The Highland Inn in Atlanta. Clean, spacious room, conveniently located near several restaurants and shopping centers. Friendly and attentive staff. Loved the cat! I highly recommend this hotel.
The rooms are quite dated, but clean and functional. I would not recommend this hotel for the elderly or people with limited mobility. The continental breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. It's a perfectly adequate budget hotel and located conveniently.
Wanted a funky old hotel and that is what we got. Room was very small, but clean. Had some plumbing problems that they could not fix before we left. Had to use the lobby toilet. Too much noise late at night on a Sunday. Free breakfast was a couple of packages of English muffins and a toaster. Cool neighborhood. Close to downtown.Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. All of our rooms are different and we do have larger rooms depending on how much you want to spend. It sounds like you stayed in one of our budget friendly rooms which do tend to be smaller. Sorry to hear that you had plumbing issues, we normally would move you unless we were at capacity. I do apologize for the inconvenience this issue caused you. Our breakfast is complimentary and is comparable to industry standards (English muffins, bagels, toast, yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, cereal, milk, juice coffee). If you are looking for a hot breakfast in the future there are several great options within walking distance. Best, Kristin Anderson, Assistant Hotel Manager
The Highland Inn is absolutely charming! All of the staff was incredibly friendly, the neighborhood could not be cooler and the room had a ton of personality. There are a jillion bars, music venues and restaurants in easy walking distance.Thank you for coining us the best in-town hotel! We are happy to hear that you got to experience our wonderful neighborhood and that our staff was friendly. Hopefully, we will welcome you back to the inn in the near future!Best wishes, Kristin AndersonAssistant General ManagerThe Highland Inn
This is a great hotel at a great price. I stayed here for four nights from May 27 to June 1. Not only are the amenities great, free continental breakfast, free Wi Fi, free parking, a laundry room, restaurant and bar, books, magazines, a nice sitting room and comfortable bedrooms with air conditioning, tubs, showers, and cable TV. You are within walking distance of parks, shops, restaurants, bars, and public transportation. I also discovered by accident that It is just two blocks from President Jimmy Carter's museum. What else can you askThank you for taking the time to leave such an extensive and wonderful review of the hotel. We love that you appreciate our uniqueness and that you were able to experience our wonderful area. Please come back and visit us again soon!Best, Kristin AndersonAssistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
This was an amazing place to stay the people were so friendly and upon my arrival I was offered a suite instead of the room that I had reservations for and they did not charge me extra for the better room. They were very helpful with directions and everything. Definitely a great place to stay if you are visiting Atlanta and within walking distance of many great places.
When you see a hotel in a great location in Atlanta costing about 80 per night, you know it's not going to be the Holiday Inn. I saw the bad reviews, but none of the complaints proved true, the hot water worked fine. Other than the seam in the carpet being visible, a most uneven floor, and a TV a little far from the bed, there was nothing to criticize. The room was clean and large with a sofa, small fridge, microwave, and comfortable bed. Some may be offended because the bathroom is small and the lavatory is in the room. Virginia Highlands is a great, downtown neighborhood with great restaurants. One block away is the very nice and reasonably priced hipster Sweet Auburn BBQ which is not traditional BBQ, but good. Within a few blocks are residential streets listed on the historic register because of their unique architecture. The neighborhood feels safe. The King Center, Carter Center, and Fernbank Science Museum are no more than 5-10 minutes by car depending on the traffic. For the same price you can stay at an econolodge near a mall at an interstate exit with newer carpet. Thank you for taking the time to leave such an extensive and wonderful review of the hotel. We love that you appreciate our uniqueness and that you were able to truly experience our neighborhood. Please come back and visit us again soon!Best wishes, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
This hotel is located in a great location near walking distance to restaurants and a nice running trail. It's not always the nicest of rooms and it can get noisy at nice, but it serves the purpose for when I'm travelling for business since I don't need a car or the Marta to get around town. This is a distance from the airport so know that it is probably easier to take a cab.
I have no idea what all the complaints are about with this vintage, friendly, accomodating,centrally located Inn. From Ken, who was sitting outside at 7:30 a.m. in the morning when Iarrived and waited til I checked in to even carry my bag upstairs and absolutely refused totake a tip from me, to T. J., who by telephone was able to change my room and was sovery friendly at check-in and check-out and even offered to lock up my luggage aftercheck out time. They are both keepers and with a small inconvenience of deluxe roomsit was worth it to meet these kind of people in a big city environment where people aremore concerned about the almighty dollar than treating people with cordiality. My experiencein Atlanta will be remembered because I decided to stay at the Highland Inn instead of ahotel chain. Keep up the great atmostphere and positive greetings and helpfulness toyour guests! Much Appreciated.Wow! Thank you for your 5-star review. We really appreciate you sharing your experience with potential guests and for the kind words about our location and staff! I will be sure to share your praises with them. Please stay with us again the next time you are in the area!Best wishes, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
This is a great place to stay in Atlanta. There are bars and restaurants close by and it is a nice, safe area to walk around. There are bus stops near by and it is a pleasant twenty minute walk to the MARTA station which goes to the airport. There is a vegetarian restaurant next door but we went to Manuel's bar down the road which is a great place to eat. There is also Publix supermarket just round the corner. The staff were really friendly and helped us out when we needed to use a phone to call our car hire company. The breakfast was minimal but there are places to eat nearby so it isn't a problem. The place is 'european style' and is decorated in a quirky way. A great place to stay.
As you walk into the front door you are immediately taken back to a time before you were born. At least, if you were born after 1927. That is right, this one is still standing, still functioning, and still serving the public as it reaches 90. Your room key can be found in the appropriate cubbyhole, and when you travel down one of the long hallways and reach your room, well ... you are in 1927 with an internet connection! Well maintained and adequate you will enjoy this step into the past.
For a low-budget hotel this is very classy, especially at 45/night through hotels.com. I stayed there five nights for a conference and parked downtown for 5 - 8 per day. There is also convenient public transportation. The staff is the friendliest and most natural I have ever met.The bed was a little soft and there was no bureau for clothes, but I would return every time rather than pay 2 - 3 times as much. The neighborhood is truly funky and laid back, Cafe 640 next door has wonderful cuisine, and there is a good coffee shop one block north. You can afford to pay for good coffee at these rates.
Absolutely perfect. I am a young(ish) widow who returned to my roots in Atlanta for a reunion with dear friends two years after the death of my darling husband. This hotel was in a word, magical. The location was ideal, the atmosphere was serene, and the accommodations, although simple and basic, were so appreciated. It was truly my home away from home, although I felt more at home there than I do in my own home. Ive stayed in five star hotels in Europe that I did not enjoy as much as I did The Highland. I will not stay anywhere else ever while in Atlanta, until I move backJulie, Thank you so much for your review. It means so much to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to welcome you back again soon.
Stayed here for a couple of nights in November while visiting relatives nearby.The property is old (quaint if you prefer) but the room was clean and functional.I stayed at the back end of the lobby level so it was quiet and pleasant enough. My only observation was the Wifi in the room didn't work especially well. I think if one were to stay in a room closer to the lobby that problem wouldn't be as much of an issue.I would stay here again.
My boyfriend and I decided to do a quick weekend trip to Atlanta. He has been staying at this hotel for a decade and recommended that we stay here. I'm glad we did. The building has a great vibe to it: old-school, independent, classic. The staff were super nice and always said hi and bye as we came and left. The rooms are fine. They aren't luxury, but we weren't looking for luxury. Bed was comfy, linens were clean. Windows opened, so we were able to have fresh air. Pirate the cat stays there and is super cool, too. I'll definitely come back.
I stayed at the Kimpton during a business trip and loved the location. It is in the heart of the theater district and very close to public transit. The rooms were small but very clean and the bed was comfortable. I loved that they had a yoga mat in the room! Front desk was helpful and friendly. I would recommend the Kimpton HotelHey Monika!Thank for taking time to enhance our online reputation! Glad to see you were able to take advantage of our fabulous location and you were able to take advantage of some of our unique amenities! Come back and see us again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
We loved our stay at the hotel. The interior design is just fantastic. Art Deco revival lives in that hotel. The best part was the evening cocktail party for the entire hotel. Every evening everyone is invited to the lobby for a complimentary drink of prosecco. Not my favourite drink but fun. You do have the feeling that it was from a different age. PThe rooms were well done and quiet. Friendly staff although I got the wrong directions to the subway to Ohare when I was checking out and one of the bartenders does not know anything about wine, which is odd given how much they are charging for it. Fairly minor issues. The wifi was really hard to use at first. They say it's free and it is but they want you to fill out this form on-line asking way to many questions and very personal at that. I refused and called their support line and the guy was very helpful and gave me an access code that was not given to me at checkin in. I was very annoyed that they were trying to mine data from me that way. I have not seen a hotel do that before and I thought it was sneaky and inappropriate. I thought the cost was very reasonable and the location is great, easy access to the downtown and a good distance to the west loop which now seems to have the best restaurants and a very vibrant atmosphere. I would go back for sure.
Kimptons, to paraphrase a great movie, are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get.This was my third stay at a Kimpton (one in LA, one in D.C., and now Chicago), and I think I am going to take my business elsewhere. The front desk service is uneven at best -- Upon our arrival, the person who served us was not very professional, welcoming nor particularly courteous.As a dog owner, I appreciate that the hotel welcomes pets, however we were affronted by dozens of snorting, wheezing and coughing pugs (with their doting owners in toe) scattered about the lobby (and courtesy coffee area) from the moment we arrived until we departed two days later. Pugs Take Chicago! (and the Kimpton Allegro Hotel)!Our room was disappointing. Clean Yes. Comfortable bed Yes. Nice decor Shoddy. Bathroom Miniature. Lighting Awful. (This was very reminiscent of the Kimpton we stayed at in D.C., although that hotel was in dire need of a renovation and should never have marketed itself as a Kimpton. Free Internet NON-EXISTENT!This Kimpton is also located in the financial district (next to a theater). Stores and businesses closed early and it was difficult getting basic staple items past 9pm during our stay.Which is my real beef here: Somewhere along the line, the name Kimpton garnered a lot of respect from a few high-end properties. So now, there is an expectation that when one chooses a Kimpton, the same level of excellence and high quality hotel experience will exist at all of their properties. That is NOT the case. And I am done trying to find which ones uphold that expectation.Thanks for taking time to provide feedback from your stay. We're sorry to see you weren't fully satisfied and apologize for the issue you experienced with your guestroom. Should your travels bring you back to Chicago, we would welcome the opportunity to provide you with a much improved experience in the future.Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
The basic king room is on the smaller side, but the bathroom is ultra tiny u can barely function in there. It was still perfect for 2 for a w/e getaway. Great downtown location, within walking distance to the Mag Mile The Metro is jst a couple of blocks away. We stayed the Monaco in January, which has the perfect sized basic king room for two was really nice. Here, the Allegro, the rooms are smaller, but the common spaces lobby are pretty ginormous compared to the 3 other Kimptons, in other cities, that we've stayed . The lobbies are notoriously very tiny. We got a phenomenal rate for this past w/e's stay - 125/nite + 25 per day restaurant/ bar credit. That equals 75 that we used the bar!! But watch-out, the catch is that you have 2 come to the bar/ restaurant daily jst use 25/day not use it all once like we did. BUT they did not tell us that check-in all...... But way to go, Kimpton, they honored it took 75 off! You know how 2 keep the Martins coming back! They're nice, cute quirky, we will back! Oh other review said that the walls were 'paper thin', or too much noise..... We were on the 8th floor had not 1 issue w noise all, AND I am a light sleeper too.Hi Martin's! It's great to see you were able to take advantage of one of our room packages and check out our restaurant 312 Chicago! Feel free to reach out to me directly and we can look into getting you guys upgraded into a larger room for your next visit.Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
I stayed at the Chicago Allegro for seven nights. Check-in was smooth, room was stylish and clean, everything worked. Nice bar with friendly service at the lobby level (thanks Raphael) and a good breakfast for a reasonable price if you decide to eat in. Good location and great access to all the things you want to do on foot or by public transport. Chris J,we love seeing 5* reviews - thank you! Raphael at Bar Allegro is amazing and we are so happy to have him as part of the team at the Allegro! Hoping you'll be back for some more libations served by him.Iris JungeRooms Director
I have been taking my husband downtown as a Christmas Present for the past few years. We have been trying new hotels on each stay. We have been trying all the Kimpton hotels in Chicago and this year we tried the Hotel Allegro. Hotel Allegro has a beautiful art deco theme, rooms are not large but it is downtown Chicago and the space is used effectively. We knew the secret password that got us a couple of free drinks at the bar. The hotel, like the other Kimpton Hotels offers a cocktail hour where they served sparkling wine and spiked hot chocolate. The spiked hot chocolate was super yummy, went back for a mugful the little tasting glass they gave was not going to cut it. Beds were comfy, shower had great pressure. I would stay and reccomend the hotel. If you take the time you can find all sorts of sitting areas to hang out in. Coffee Hot Chocolate bar in the morning. Check out the various packages they have, we got the room and valet parking rate for 160 on a Saturday night.Hello!Thank you for the wonderful review! It looks like you've hit it all! Thanks for staying with us and surprising your husband for Christmas! We're so happy to hear that you enjoyed the spiked hot chocolate! It's perfect for this time of year! We hope to see you and your husband soon!kimptonlove babyitscoldoutsideRachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
My husband and I spent the weekend in Chicago for our anniversary and stayed at this hotel. We were on like the 17th floor. The room was really nice and the staff was very accomodating. The hotel is very clean. We got stuck in traffic for 3 hrs in indiana on the way to the hotel and I called to let them know we wouldn't be there until midnight rather than 9pm. they checked me in over the phone, it was simple and took less than 2 minutes. The free breakfast is fruit, tea, coffee, water, and granola but it's free so no complaining. :) the room was bigger than I expected considering we were in downtown. The location cannot be beat! It was like 5 blocks from Willis tower and if you walk to the right from the hotel, you run straight into millennium park! The famous Chicago theater is just 3 blocks away. Hard rock cafe and portillos are like 7 blocks. Giordanos is also pretty close. Actually, everything is close. We did not pay to park at the hotel but parked at a garage across the street which was cheaper. It was less like 80 for the weekend, we parked our car and didn't drive again until we drove home. It's pretty easy to find the hotel and pretty easy to get back to the highway too.
After returning from Chicago and a stay at the Hotel Allegro, celebrating my partner's birthday, I can't say enough good things about the hotel. While our check-in was a little rocky with a staff member who was a bit terse ( though solely trying to deal with what seemed to be a security issue), overall our stay was great. Staff even had candies, nuts and beer in the room, with a hand-written card waiting for us in our room, as a birthday gift for my husband. The hotel has recently been updated but stays true to its Theater district roots. Modern Art Deco design adorns throughout, while still giving this hotel an old world classy feeling. However, note standard rooms are smaller than the average sizes today, though you will have just enough space to not feel cramp.
We came downtown for my sisters bachelorette weekend and decided to stay here. What a great decision. Centrally located in the loop close to restaurants, theaters and shopping. The hotel is exquisite in its decor. The staff can not be anymore friendly and ready to accommodate you. Every evening between 5-6pm with your room key there is free Proseco or Sangria in the lobby bar area. And believe me all the guests take advantage of it. Right now they are doing a bit of construction so there are some noisy periods but besides that no complaints. Rooms decent size for downtown. Love their amenities. Bonus there is a Starbucks connected to the hotel on the first floor. I usually am not disappointed by a Kimpton property and I can add this one to the list. Great customer service and a charming art deco vibe is what we aim for! Thanks for staying with us. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!
I can't speak to everything as I was not on site. My understanding is that the event went off, without any issues. Having never hosted there before, more information up front would have been helpful, 1) who's our point of contact while we are there, if we have issues, 2) who's handling the catering, 3) who do we contact if the AV isn't working. Thanks for staying with us. I am sorry that some of the key information was not relayed properly. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback. We will be passing this along to our department managers to ensure future events run smoothly!
The lobby is really nice, letting you revive the 1920's atmosphere. Unfortunately, the room we had was a bit smaller as expected, in particular with respect to the hotel's category.Complementary coffee in the morning and champagne in the evenings are a very nice offer. Take the occasion to enjoy the lobby's atmosphereThanks for taking time to enhance our online reputation! We're delighted to see you were able to bask in the opulence of our lobby and take advantage of our nightly social hour. The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Thanks again and we hope to see you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
This place is so well located, you can take the blue line from the airport straight here and its a 4 min walk, with no changes.You are also so close to the river and next door to Les Miserables show at the moment, its easy to get around by walking or on the bus from here.Rooms are nice and free prosseco goes down well every day at 5pm.Great Art Deco feelHighly recommendedHello! We truly appreciate you taking the time to provide your comments. The Allegro is fortunate to have such a convenient location to share with all of its guests to make city livin' easy. Our staff (and complimentary Prosecco) will always be here to welcome you back!
My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at Allegro. It was a great location, the staff was friendly and the room was fantastic. We paid for an upgrade once we got there and I'm so glad we did, the room was spacious and I slept like a rock! I would definitely stay there again. The only drawback is that everything around the hotel closes relatively early so make sure to grab dinner early or plan to go to another area of the city.Hey Natalieaz9!Thanks for the 5 star review!! I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed your upgraded room and slept like a rock! What's better than that! We hope to see you again soon!Rachel RodriguezFront Office Manager
The Concierge, David Moore, was above and beyond accomodating and welcoming to set me up with everything I needed for my work trip. He was miraculously familiar with the nature of my work and my recent health condition, and I was touched and delighted to find that while I was out, he tailored our room to accomodate my special needs so that I could thrive, personally and professionally, during my stay at the Kimpton Allegro. I look forward to staying there again during my next visit, and I hope he gets a magnificent raise before then. Also, the beds and bathrobes were supremely comfortable. 3Hello! We truly appreciate you taking the time to write this review about your stay. I am thrilled to hear that David gave you a spectacular experience and we are so proud to have him as part of our team! I will be sure to pass along your feedback to him. We hope to welcome you back soon to provide you with another great stay!
Great room and we'll looked after by staff, first visit to Chicago and could not have picked a better hotel, staff so pleasant and can't do enough to make your stay so great.The lobby has a bar and great music for you to relax, the decor is great and makes you feel so relaxed.Glad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
We recently had a great stay at the Hotel Allegro. Upon arriving, it is like traveling back in time as you are greeted by a grand staircase! The staff was warm and helpful from the front desk to the concierge to the bell man. Although I had the idea that the rooms were on the small side, our original room seemed smaller (and not accurately represented on their website) than I had expected. I inquired about it at the front desk and the lovely young woman who helped me (I am awfully sorry I do not remember her name to give her recognition!) was amazing. She said although it appeared that the category of the room was correct, she said that she was surprised that we had not been upgraded as Inner Circle members. She immediately switched our room to a much larger king suite. We really appreciate this kind of service! The location of the Hotel Allegro is central: in the Loop, walkable to shopping, Millennium Park, and restaurants, block or so from Clark/Lake Blue Line to the airport. We would definitely stay again!Hello!We're so happy to hear that you had great interactions with our team and that were able to get upgraded and enjoy your sweet suite! We look forward to seeing you again soon!Happy holidays!Rachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
I can't say enough about this boutique hotel in the center of all the action. This hotel has been recently updated and it's even cleaner, prettier, and friendlier than it was. Everyone has a smile and is always trying to make your stay perfect. They upgraded us because they knew it was our 40th anniversary. Cassie at the front desk remembered us each day when we entered the lobby. People of all sorts , with pets, with kids, same sex couples, young and old. I love the wonderful mix of incredible people. This is how Chicago should be seen. And you are only steps from the best shopping in town on state street and the best theater in the Midwest. You will feel safe and comfortable and you will return....
I'll start by saying if you're looking for over the top, extraordinary, then this is not the hotel for you. But, if you're looking for something that is clean, has a great art deco fitout, and in a TERRIFIC location, then keep reading. Location - in the Theatre District which means that all the major theatres are easy to walk to. Millenium Park is about a 7 minute walk. The Magnificent Mile is about 15 mins walk (could probably walk faster if people didn't walk 3 abreast the path).Rooms - we had a room on the 5th floor. It was fine, bathroom a bit small with very little counterspace. Beware - the bottles of water left out on the desk are NOT free. Bed was very comfortable. Pillows were awful - either little more than some cotton wool bunched together or a huge bag of cement. Rooms were quiet. There was evidence in the hallway of someone's big night out a couple of rooms down but we didn't hear a thing. Staff - polite enough, but nothing special. Great to let us have the room a bit earlier than regulation checkin. The late checkout is very handy. They can keep your bags for you while you wander the city. Concierge were particularly helpful but no one else could help with directions to theatres, bars etc. Disappointing. Valet car parking - at 63/night, it's definitely not cheap, but they will hold your car until 6pm which is great if you're catching a matinee show somewhere. There are plenty of self park lots nearby. Would we stay here again Probably!Happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of our excellent downtown location! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!
One of my favorite places to stay in Chicago. The rooms are small, but the atmosphere and service is outstanding. This was recently redecorated and maintains is classic art deco style. Close to theaters, the river and walking distance to downtown. Adjacent 312 restaurants serves consistently great food.Friendly and comfortable is what we aim for and we are very proud of the team we have! The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
This is the 2nd time that I have stayed at Hotel Allegro. The hotel went thru an extensive remodel since the last time that I stayed here. Front Desk Service is 1st rate all the way and the Front Desk Personnel was very courteous and polite. My room was located on the 11th floor facing Randolph Street. The room was decor was to my taste and the bathroom was spotless. If your in Chicago on your visit I highly and strongly recommend this wonderful hotel..We appreciate you taking the time to write this review! Your feedback is truly valued. It's wonderful to see that you've enjoyed your stays with us. Our staff looks forward to welcoming you back in the future!
High points The Allegro hotel is like going back in time. The lobby is beautifully restored art Deco with modern amenities. Fireplace is wonderful and there are multiple seating areas. Staff is friendly, attentive and efficient. Rooms are spacious, small bathrooms but excellent water pressure in shower. Beds and pillows excellent. Hotel robes are luscious. Low point:Virtually no closet since it is about 6 inches deep and clothes must hang sideways.Extra points Complimentary bubbly in lobby in afternoon!Thanks for the great review! We're pleased to see you enjoyed your stay with us and took the time to mix and mingle during our complimentary social hour! Come back to see us again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
We spent two nights (Fri/Sat) at the Kimpton Hotel Allegro while seeing 2 shows in Chicago. Access from O'Hare to the hotel by train was easy, The hotel let us check in early and the room was very nice. They have a 5pm champaign happy hour that we attended both nice and ended up meeting and having great conversations with other guests. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations, especially when it rained all day on Saturday and we had already been to the usual museums on previous trips. The only negative was the slow elevators with only 2 of the 3 being operational.Hello! Thank you kindly for taking the time to review our hotel. While we are pleased to see that you had a positive stay overall, we offer our apologies for the poor service of the elevators during you're stay. We are in the process of remodeling our elevators now so that we may better serve our guests. We hope to welcome you back for an improved experience in the future!
I stayed here two nights for work. This is such a great location - right next to the Chicago Palace theatre. The room was so modern and well light. Loved the decor and instantly loved it. I could also get out of the hotel and walk to a lot of places. Starbucks is right next door - so it was easy to grab coffee in the morning. HAppy hour was awesome - so definitely don't miss it. They had sangria, wine and beer! Overall had a great experience and will definitely be back again!
This was my second five-night stay for business. My room this time was a tad bigger with more shelving in the bathroom to accommodate my toiletries. This was a HUGE plus. Traveling in the middle of winter, the rates are phenomenal for this beautiful hotel and loop location! I'm able to easily walk to and from place of business each day. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The accommodations are above average in every way. The bed is extremely comfortable with high quality sheets. My housekeeper was excellent (absolutely the best I've had) ANTICIPATING my needs. How often does that happenWhat a wonderful review! Thanks for continually choosing our hotel and we look forward to seeing you in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
In the heart of the theatre district this is one of the oldest hotels in Chicago. and is ideally placed to tour downtown.if you arrive at O'Hare International Airport there's no need to pay a high taxi fare (unless perhaps you are loaded with bags!) Use the CTA train from Terminal 2 which, for 5 dollars takes you to Clarke and Lake where the hotel is situated just down the street, a 3 minute walk. This worked well for us.The hotel is clean and rooms comfortable but is showing signs of age in some of the dcor but perhaps this adds to its old world charm. Staff were pleasant and helpful and complimentary coffee in the lobby was a nice touch.There is no restaurant at this hotel but there is an arrangement with the restaurant next door. We were catching a night train so didn't get to try the breakfast.The bed was comfortable and was welcome after a long flight.Complimentary dressing gowns in the bathroom offered that little extra luxury.The mini bar was extensively stocked but like all hotels, expensive!I'd certainy recommend this hotel as a base for exploring as anywhere downtown is within easy walking distance and local transport for further afield is easy.Good Afternoon,A charming art deco vibe is what we aim for! Thanks for staying with us. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!
We love Hotel Allegro. We have never taken our dog, but we love that the property is so pet friendly. The wine hour in the lobby is a great place to enjoy watching other guests mingle with their pets in tow. The property is always clean and the dcor is fresh and modern. We have always been impressed with our rooms, the check-in, check-out procedure and the friendly staff. There are several greats restaurants there in the theater district as well. Overall, a great place to stay for the money.
Hotel Allegro is a unique hotel with nice rooms at a sensible price. They do not have room service but there is a Starbucks on the ground level. The continental breakfast is just right and easy to grab on your way out in the morning.
Nice comfortable bed. Our clean Room was nice and the size was normal for a boutique hotel. Service was first class. Very busy. Great location very near to the theater district. we were able to easily walk to anywhere we wanted to go in downtown Chicago.Glad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
After a long day in meetings it's nice to know that my room was clean, comfortable, well decorated in artful and colorful furniture pieces. Unique room decors, tasteful and different great for the frequent traveler !Loved the robes provided, linen and bed was comfortable as well as oversized. Full snack and beverage purchase available in the room.Great location to the train to the airport as well as to other areas of Chicago.A must visit on your next Chicago business or fun trip.Thanks for the excellent review! We're delighted to see you enjoyed your stay and our Frette linens and robes and we look forward to seeing you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
Have been there for 2 weeks, pretty well located in the Loop and close to my office.Rooms are smart and well furnished ... cleaning is ok ... bathroom perfect! Just a minor: no breakfast... just tea and coffee freely provided ... but Starbucks is almost in the hotel :)
I must begin by thanking the guest services staff who worked pleasantly to return a jacket I accidentally left in my room closet! Michael and Bridget were beyond gracious when I phoned to ask if the items could be found and then shipped to my home. Their attitudes and attention were lovely! Our Thanksgiving weekend was very pleasant due to the fun atmosphere and beautiful Gatsby-ish decor along with the great staff. We enjoyed prosecco and hot toddies in the evenings and wonderful continental breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Our room on the 12th floor was quiet and the elevator service was great. We simply cannot praise this hotel enough! There were many nice conversation areas sprinkled around the lobby which were inviting and provided nice areas to enjoy the holiday decorations! Be sure to join the Kimpton Rewards program for free WiFi and credit for the minibar! Dont hesitate to book this great downtown/theatre district hotel!Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. It is great to hear that our staff was able to assist in returning your jacket to you! And we are happy that you enjoyed your stay overall - from the 20's style lobby and Prosecco hour to our Italian restaurant and convenient location. We hope to welcome you back soon!
This is the third time we have stayed at the Allegro and it won't be the last. The staff were the best. From front desk to bartenders every thing was GREAT. The location was also excellent, near restaurants, theaters and shopping.Hey Jay J!WOOO! I love seeing reviews like this! The third time was a charm! We look forward to seeing you again soon! Thank you for the awesome comments about the staff! I'd have to say they are the best team around! Rachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
Came here with family and dog for 2 nights on New Years Eve. Wine / champagne reception was fun with lots of room to spread out. Room was comfortable. Bathroom tiny. Not much of a view. Our dog loved the room and was very excited to be here. Love the Kimpton hotels. Starbucks next door, but not too much else around for dining. Hello Dragonfly1004,We are so happy you, your family, and pup enjoyed your time with us, especially at our social hour! Unfortunately being downtown in the city, some of the buildings block the views. Hopefully you visit us again soon. Also, our concierge team would love to recommend dining options in the area for your next trip!Rachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
Great centrally located hotel, but the highlight is the customer service. Shoutout to Caitlin from the concierge team, super helpful before my arrival. Every team member was super helpful and the room was well appointed. Clean and great bathroom amenities. There is construction happening, but did not experience any noise during my stay. They were proactive and placed a letter and ear plugs in the room to help. Great to see a hotel try to get ahead of an opportunity outside of their control. Another added bonus was the complimentary coffee station the lobby each morning, simple and nice touch. Very happy with this stay and will return again when heading back to Chicago. Thank you for taking the time to complete this review! The Allegro is fortunate to have such a friendly and helpful staff to accommodate guests. We really appreciate your comments about the construction, as well. We are constantly thinking of new ways to ensure that this city-mandated project does not negatively impact the guest experience we provide. If your travels bring you back to the city, we hope to welcome you back!
The Hotel Allegro is an older hotel that has been renovated in the heart of the Chicago Loop. The location is ideal for theater goers and has easy access to public transport and cabs. The rooms are very well decorated and very clean, and the bed was wonderful. The Atelier Bloom amenities are nice, and the cheetah bathrobe is a fun touch. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is for the very small rooms and slow elevators, both likely as a result of it being a historic property. If you are traveling solo or are a close couple without a lot of luggage you should be ok, otherwise you should probably consider a roomier option.Hi there jpinedo! Thanks for taking the time to enhance our online reputation! Wonderful to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and took the cheetah robe for a spin. Good news, our Atelier Bloem products will soon be available on our KimptonStyle.com website for purchase, so you can have a little piece of Kimpton with you all the time! Should a return visit be in the future, feel free to reach out to me directly and we see about upgrading you into one of our larger rooms! Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
My queen room was compact, but beautifully decorated. Small bathroom with luxurious finishes. Very comfortable, only downside is no room service, it would ave been nice for breakfast. Pleasantly surprised at how quiet the room was, no noise from the street.Hi Kimberly, Thank you for your feedback! We apologize about not having room service, but we hope you were able to enjoy a meal in our restaurant, 312 Chicago! We look forward to seeing you again! Happy holidays, Rachel Rodriguez Guest Experience Manager
Do not stay at the hotel Allegro if you value professional courtesy, stable internet connections, or not being subjected to overhearing whatever television show or casual conversation in which the next room is engaged. The beds are small as well. If you're over 6 ft like me, stay somewhere else. Most infuriating of all was my experience with the internet. It was down consistently. It turns out that there was an issue with the router on my floor -- which in and of itself is not a deal breaker. But they asked me to call their tech support staff, which is odd because the guests shouldn't be the ones troubleshooting internet connectivity. I spoke with the technician for around 25 minutes before he figured out the cause. By this point, the meeting that I was supposed to be attending via teleconference was almost halfway over. I marched to the front desk and asked for a new room and was made to feel like a criminal. One of the desk staff actually smirked at me as I described my difficulties. I lost business because I stayed here. Do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake of staying at the Hotel Allegro.Ouch! I'm so sorry to hear that your internet connection was so unstable and that you missed the conference call that you were supposed to attend. As a business traveler, I completely understand the frustration of poor internet. Please reach out to me at rachel.rodriguezallegrochicago.com so we can discuss this matter and come up with a resolution. Rachel RodriguezFront Office Manager
What a great hotel! The decor and architecture is an exceptional mix of modern and vintage. The location was perfect for catching a show, as it is in Chicago's theater district. Our room was comfortable, although the bathroom was very small. They brought a Keurig to the room upon request. I cannot say enough about the porters/greeters/concierge - they were classy and helpful and kind.Friendly and comfortable is what we aim for and we're so proud of our team! The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Come back soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
I arrived in the lobby of the beautiful Kimpton Allegro on a busy Saturday night looking for a group of friends. Immediately, Sandy Gallagher (The Guest Experience Manager what a great job title!) asked if I needed some help. She escorted me around to all the hidden little intimate alcoves of the lobby until I found my group. Wow!We truly appreciate you writing this review on your stay! I'm so glad I was able to make a great first impression for our hotel. It was a pleasure meeting you, and we look forward to welcoming you back soon!
This is a nice boutique hotel with the usual Kimpton style. The hotel is conveniently located in the Loop, within walking distance of all major attractions. The bed was super comfortable and the room quite clean. In typical Kimpton style, fruit infused water and iced tea are available in the lobby, prosecco and / or Aperol Spritzes are served from 5-6, and a chocolate sampling is available on Saturday. More good - a nice bar, ample sitting room, and a great staff... shout out to Mariah at the front desk... she's great. Two issues - (1) the bathroom is crazy small... I had a bigger one in NYC... and (2) we were out of the room from 9-3:30 and the room wasn't cleaned... After contacting the hotel they promptly cleaned the room and sent some goodies to appologize. Overall, I think this is a great property and look forward to visiting again.Thanks for the comprehensive review of our hotel! I'm pleased to see there were several aspects of your stay that you enjoyed and that you were able to take advantage of some of our offerings. Should your travels bring you back to Chicago, feel free to reach out to me directly and I can get you in a room with a larger bathroom to ensure maximum comfort! As for housekeeping, I would suggest letting us know when you prefer service when you arrive so we can best arrange a time with housekeeping during the busy summer season. Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to seeing you sometime in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
Always consistent, always take great care of us and a fabulous property! Sales and event staff - can't say enough. They are a true partner and always anticipate our needs. As a meeting planner, this is one of my favorite hotels - and we book across the county and globally, daily.Thanks for the great feedback from your experiences at our property! We are lucky to have a great team and we look forward to serving you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
Amazing stay at the Kimpton properties. Staff was extremely pleasant as soon as we checked in. Provided a cute puppy welcome bag with treats and pet friendly locations. Also pet bed ans bowls are available upon request. Celebrated bday outing and dropped off mini cupcakes and a hand written card. Complimentary cocktail social was great. Would highly recommend to those traveling with pets (no fees) and in an amazing location! Rooms were comfy and plush Happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of our excellent downtown location and complimentary pet amenities! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to welcoming you and your pooch back in the future! Amber Bertsch Guest Experience Manager
Our third stay. Well maintained, great staff, nice bar, rooms are great if on the small side but that's the norm in Chicago. Easy walking distance to the park and river and plenty of good places to eat and drink
I am an IHG Spire member and when IHG integrated the acquired Kimpton Hotel in 2018, I decided to try one and this is my first Kimpton and I had a great experience. The room is large, very clean, well appointed and super comfortable. Everything is a notch higher than the usual IHG brands - even the bathroom amenity is of very high quality.The hotel is in a great location but can be a challenge for getting food in the evening, and it is very convenient for transportation. Blue Line station bound for the O'Hare Airport is about 2 blocks away and it made catching my morning flight way easier than I expected.I would definitely come back again on my next business trip.
What you get for the price is a steal of a deal. The decorations are very unique classy so I loved it visually. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They keep the grounds very clean and up to date. The rooms, are small, but that didn't bother me as I wasn't there to spend time in my room. The bathroom was beautiful and very clean, yet again, small. The walls are thin, so if anyone talks loudly, you can hear them. I loved that the offer complimentary wine every evening, with generous portions. I would go back because location, cleanliness and staff, it was well worth the price I paid. Thanks for the nice time!Thanks for the lovely review! We're happy to see you were able to take advantage of our daily social hour and we hope to see you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
Loved this hotel. I stayed her on business a few months ago. It's a great location. And you can walk to almost anywhere from here. The bar is really nice and they do happy hour too! The hotel is a little older but super well maintained. The wifi is great too. Rooms are therefore not your standard USA size, a little smaller, think European Chain type sizes. Breakfast in the restaurant was great, service a little low but worth the wait.Happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
Nice blend of old art deco and modern kimpton fiunk. rooms were nicely proportioned, wonderful lobby ( which is now even better after the renovation) in a very central location with easy access to theatre/restaurants/transport. The staff also stepped up to make a great experience during a hectic conference week. Our group also managed to check out the group-meeting catering and rooms which was also excellent. This could be my favorite chicago Kimpton.
From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone was friendly and helpful. The property (especially the lobby area) is reflective of scene out of a classic 40's/50's movie...really cool! You enter through the street level, but you take the stairs or elevator up to the first floor where the lobby, check-in desk, bar and restaurants are located. There are 3 elevators, pretty busy during the 'rush' like check-in and check-out times, but most of the time we never had to wait too long to get into one. It helped that our room was on the 4th floor. Our room was nice, but anticipate it to be a little smaller than most, particularly the bathroom. This wasn't an issue for my husband and I, but had we brought our kid it'd have been tight. Bed was comfortable, and most of the usual amenities that you'd expect are available in the room. We LOVE the bath products...smelled marvelous! Had to request for a few more so we could take them back to Dallas with us, lol! Our room was located close to the elevator and in front of the ice machine room, but surprisingly we were never bothered by noise (and I'm a light sleeper). The rooms seemed sound-proof because we hardly heard the outside traffic noise or even from the loop train nearby. Also have to note that this hotel's location is on point. It is located in the financial/business area so keep in mind that most restaurants have limited hours during weekdays and are closed on the weekends. But we practically walked everywhere--fairly short distances to both Millennium Park area and the Magnificent Mile where you can find everything else. Also, we took the Blue line directly from O'Hare airport, and the Clark/Lake station where you'd get off is a short walk couple of blocks away from the hotel. So convenient!!Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay. We love Chicago, and hope to return to this hotel to stay due to the lovely service we've received and how greatly located it is to everything. Wouldn't have done it any other way.Friendly and comfortable is what we aim for and we're so proud of our team! The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Come back soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
My husband and I were impressed with Kimpton Allegro's Art Deco decor, cleanliness service. Conveniently located in downtown Chicago just a 45min ride on the L (blue-line) away from the airport. Kimpton hotels never let us down!Happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of our excellent downtown location! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future! Amber Bertsch Guest Experience Manager
This hotel placed in the middle of Chicago has its inconveniences. Directly placed next to overground trains you see and hear them - all time. Walking me up every night at 4 am , no need for a wake up call.Paper thin walls (I can hear my neighbors conversations do not add to the comfort. I think this Is also the smallest hotel room I have ever been in in the US. The closet is not even wide even to hang your shirts.It is clean an proper looking but there are things you cannot make up for.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback on your stay. I'm sorry to see that you had a negative experience at our hotel! Should you stay with us again, we could place you on a high floor away from street noise and the train. We have larger rooms, as well, such as our King Premier that would provide you with the extra space you're looking for. We would love the opportunity to offer you a much improved stay in the future!
Our room was huge, which was not what I was expecting in the first place. The staff was INCREDIBLE accommodating and so unbelievably nice. I needed help storing a cake for a wedding I was in town for, and without question they helped me bring it down to the kitchen's fridge, and then back up again when I needed it. They were SO nice! The view was great as well. Can't say enough good things.Hi Caitlin! Thank you very much for taking the time to write this review. We love to see that you had a five-star experience! We are truly fortunate to have such a friendly staff who are eager to help with whatever you need. Come back and see us soon!
Kimpton hotels can be hit and miss. This one was a hit. Great property and location. Comfy room. Awesome pillows. Fancy soaps. I got the accessible bathroom and it was huge. The breakfast at the attached restaurant (312 Chicago) was hotel-pricey but very excellent. Short Rib Hash was greeeattt. Bar scene was hoppin' when I checked in late.
Excellent experience with all staff we were involved with. I am in love with the Allegro! Had not been a fan of Art Deco until my visit at the Allegro. Beautiful everywhere I went! The bed was very comfortable, clean room.Hi Connie! Thank you for taking the time to write this review! We are so pleased to see you enjoyed your time with us during the Reflexology conference. It was a pleasure to host your group and we hope you to welcome you back for any future trips to Chicago!
It somehow all works--the blacks and reds and silvers. The staircase to the second floor check-in (elevator also available of course), the lounging furniture in the bar area, and the pictures of flappers. It could have so easily fallen into Addams Family ambience or seedy/dark vibe, but the Allegro is a welcome relief from the stark modern, very utilitarian or hyperbolic opulence of other Chicago hotels. It is located on West Randolph next to the Palace Theater and 312 restaurant. It's an easy walk to shopping, great restaurants, the Art Institute, etc. The bed was great with four fabulous pillows. Plenty of outlets, a small but perfect bathroom with a good shower and a bath mat secured with a black ribbon. There's a chain lock on the door that provides extra privacy. The room was super quiet most of the time but it was a quiet weekend in the city. I was there alone and I think the room would feel a bit small for two people. The bar area was spacious decent wines by the glass at Chicago prices (15) and a decent bar menu. If you sit at the bar, prepare to mingle with the 20 and 30-somethings. Otherwise, take your drink to a quiet corner. They do a happy hour with prosecco and Pellegrino and there is coffee in the lobby in the morning. The place has the nicest doormen--right up there with the Magnolia in Memphis. Definitely worth a stay!Hey jhartig1!Thanks for your great review from your time with us at the Hotel Allegro! During the renovation, we definitely strived to capture the old glamour that our 1920's buildiong naturally has, so I'm happy to hear we were successful! Should your travels bring you back to Chicago, we do offer larger guestrooms that accommodate multiple people. Let me know if you need any assistance with future bookings and we hope to see you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
This was the second time I stayed here. The first time everything was fine. This time in room 1509, the neighbors on each side were very loud. The first night on one side I called the front desk and they eventually quieted down. The third night was horrible! We called the front desk 3 times around 11 AM and the people never quieted down. We had to play music to fall asleep. Then at 3:30 AM they were noisy again. When we called again, the new front desk person was not aware of the issue. She offered to move us, but at that point with an early departure, it wasnt worth it. They claimed they sent security, but no results. They said they would refund my room, but in the morning, when I mentioned our problem to the front desk person, she made no mention of it and I had to run to catch a plane.If you are a heavy sleeper, it is a very nice hotel. Small city-size rooms are nicely decorated. Beds are comfortable. They have a nice lobby bar with alcoves where groups can meet. Lucy, the bartender, is very nice and provided excellent service to our group the first time we stayed there. She was very friendly this time as well. From 5-6pm, they offer a free wine happy hour, so the ambiance is nice and lively. No room service, but the lobby bar offers snacks you can bring up to the room. We wanted to schedule our annual company meeting there but although they had well-appointed conference rooms, the catering restrictions were insurmountable. We had a group of 10 people, and they had the perfect room, but wouldnt offer a good value for the forced catering spend. We ended up getting a room at Riva on the Navy Pier, and had a continental breakfast and three course lunch and excellent service vs. a very skimpy offering at Allegro for the same spend. It would have been so much easier to keep it all in the same place, but just not worth it. If you have money to burn on a large expense account, it would probably be a nice place for a conference, as long as your guests are heavy sleepers.If you are traveling and are a heavy sleeper, it is a nice hotel. The thin walls were really puzzling and disappointing.
We were here for three nights and many plus points I.e. prosecco event, location.However the rooms are dark, the interior designer should visit Miami for inspiration for lighter colours. Who wants to stay in a room decorated with black, brown and swirled brown patterns. We could not read in bed, yes guests do like to read! My husband is elderly and the Sunday morning receptionist was quite abrupt with him. Twice he asked her questions and she shot back I dont understand you. We are English fgs. So rude of her.We like the Kimpton brand but this was a disappointment.Thank you for taking time to provide feedback from your stay. We're sorry to see you didn't fully enjoy your stay and weren't a fan of our decor. We would love to discuss your experience directly, if you could reach out at your earliest convenience!

I stayed at this hotel for business when I had to work late one night and needed to stay in the city. I chose this hotel because my company had just had their quarterly meeting here and I thought it was very nice. Check in was easy and everyone was very friendly. I love the dcor. Upon check in I was given a 10 bar card to use either at the bar or from the mini bar. I ordered a salad to go and took it to my room to eat. The room is decorated so cute. I loved it. I had the queen room and it is very small. It was fine for me but might be a bit tight if you had another person. I chose a drink from the mini bar to use my free 10. The next morning I filled out my free drink card and even took down my list of bar items as it said to do upon check to make sure I was credited for the correct item. I was asked if I wanted to use the other part of my 10.00 towards my salad and I said sure, I guess. No problem...finished my check out and headed to work. Today I check my bank account and I have two charges...one for the original amount including the hold, and another for the amount I actually paid when I checked out. When I called and asked why I was charged twice, they said well...instead of refunding you the 3.00 on the salad they did a full refund and full charge. Well guess what, this doesn't work well.....I now have two hotel charges and no refunds, as it takes several days before the refund hits your bank. I could have cared less about the 3.00, especially had I known how much of my bank account it would eat up. Luckily I had it in the bank, but I need it...I don't have a ton of extra money to just tie up an extra 172.00 for a 3.00 refund. I think this is a horrible practice and I certainly should have been told about it upfront. I am not sure if I will stay here again, I do not like to have my money messed with. :( Very disappointed.Ouch! This makes me upset to read. I'm sorry that a great experience turned out to be a disappointment. Can you please reach out to me via email at rachel.rodriguezallegrochicago.com so I can review your bill and make sure everything is taken care of the right way and make things right. I look forward to hearing from you.Rachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
Allegro was not really what I expected. Rooms hallways were dull, drab and darkish. Bathrooms were extremely small, had to remove the garbage can to move around without tripping over it. Bar/Lounge area was just average. Not a lot of sitting area, if there's a large group. Bar tenders were nice. For the price I did expect more. Location was however good, as it was towards central downtown, and many thing were within walking distance, minuets from the rail-train. If you are into Old Historical Hotel, this may be the hotel for you, but I'm not.Because this was a business trip, and I did spend very little time in the hotel and room, it was average. If on vacation would definitely choose a more modern Hotel.Thanks for taking time to review your stay with us. I'm disappointed to see you did not enjoy your stay with us. As we are in a historic 1920's building, we aimed to put a modern twist on the classic art deco decor of that era, however we understand not everyone can appreciate that style, however I'm glad to see you were able to take advantage of our excellent location. Thanks again for providing feedback from your stay and safe travels in the future.Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
Kimpton hotels are my go to and the Allegro and their staff are among the best. Came to Chicago with my husband and family for my husband's 50th birthday weekend. I had let them know about it ahead of time and theConcierge had a special present waiting for him! He was beyond pleased and delighted)The concierge also recommended a great restaurant nearby for lunch. And of course the cocktail hour and morning coffee are lovely as well. Thanks to the staff of the Allegro for a long overdue and wonderful weekend!Glad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
Stayed here for a large trade show because its conveniently located to many restaurants and other places I needed to be. In true Kimpton form, the property was well-appointed and exceptionally clean. And the staff was wonderful.Despite a contract dispute with the housekeeping union (which affected many other hotels around the city), they were very accommodating. I was only in for 2 nights so didnt really mind making my own bed, and they readily offered to provide clean towels.As is the case In most urban hotels, the bathroom was very small, but they made the most of the available space. The work desk was fine for my needs and there were plenty of outlets for charging devices.Id definitely stay here again.Great customer service is what we aim for! Thanks for your loyalty to Kimpton and staying with us! We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!
My husband and I really loved our experience at the Kimpton. We were delighted about the complimentary happy hour and loved the lounge atmosphere. The room and bathroom though a little small had a very nice large tv and super comfy beds. I didn't particularly like the bathroom French doors which were a bit awkward. The closet even holds a nice yoga mat but I can see difficulty in doing yoga in such a small room!The fitness facility was excellent but unfortunately we didn't have any time to use it!Thanks for the review! We're delighted to see you enjoyed your first time with us and we look forward to making you loyal Kimptonites! :)Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
This is my first stay in Chicago. the location was within walking distance to most things I wanted to visit. The front desk staff is great and willing to answer any questions. We were on the 19th floor and our room was very quiet. The rooms are on the small side but I expect that in most large cities. I loved being able to take out the bikes to explore the city. Become a Kimpton rewards member as it comes with many perks.Glad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
Nice boutique hotel in the theater district. Great location. Pricey. Rooms are on the small side but very nice and clean. Hotel has a restaurant and bar. Starr are very friendly and helpful. Would love to stay again on my next trip to Chicago!!!Thank you for taking the time to enhance our online reputation! I'm so pleased to see you enjoyed your stay with us and had time to check out Bar Allegro and 312 Chicago! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to seeing you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
This is a very historic building and they have done a very nice job keeping it up to date for the needs of the modern traveler. The lobby and common areas are very inviting. The sleeping rooms however are on the small side given they were built for different times and different body sizes back in the day. We were very comfortable, the bed was great but it might get a little tight if you're a couple staying here more than one night. One interesting thing and being we wanted to sleep in on Sunday morning it was fine, is the window for our room opened on a wall about 10 ft. away and the top of the wall was covered which made for a very dark room during the morning. The one down side of staying in this part of town is that the dining options that are open later on a Saturday night are limited. We ended up eating in the 312 Restaurant which is in the hotel and it was fine but after 8pm on a Saturday night there weren't many others open in this part of town.Would definitely come back here when back in town.Thank you for providing your feedback! We are happy to see that you had an overall positive experience with us. The rooms can be on the cozy side, but we strive to make up for this with historic charm and 20's personality! If you stay with us in the future, we encourage you to request a higher room facing Randolph street so that you may enjoy a bit of a better view. We look forward to welcoming you back!
We went to a showthe theater was literally right next door and ate at the adjoining restaurant. Food was excellent and staff at the hotel wonderful. The rooms are an art deco 20s style and sumptuous. It was a fabulous weekend.Glad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon! Amber Bertsch Guest Experience Manager
I expected to like this hotel much more because of its luxury positioning, attractive lobby, free Prosecco in the evening, and brand quality, but it really falls short of what I would expect for a higher end hotel. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the public areas of the hotel are very attractive. Staff were friendly, though I really didn't feel like they made a lot of effort beyond what was asked of them. Food served at our conference was very good. But on the minus side, the room was so small it was difficult not to trip over my shoes or bump into walls or furniture. The bathroom had just a couple inches of clearance between the toilet and tub, and the toilet and sink on the other side. The sink basin area was so tight that I had to put my hands against the inside of the basin itself for the water from the faucet to hit them because the faucet was, of necessity, fight snugly over the edge of the basin. The closet depth (front to back) was only about 8 inches and hangers, and therefore clothes, only fit at an acute angle (partly sideways). Room walls were thin and one could easily hear normal conversation and the TV from adjacent rooms. Bath towels were threadbare, which was a particular surprise. Although the room itself was clean, there was a lot of dust and some debris in the AC duct on the wall, which should have been cleaned. The room window was small and overlooked buildings (walls) on three sides. A nice enough hotel, but not my idea of upscale.Hello! Thank you for choosing the Allegro we truly value your feedback! I regret to read that you did not thoroughly enjoy your stay with us. Because the hotel was constructed in the 20's, the infrastructure is difficult to significantly change. We always recommend reserving a King Premier room for added space in the bedroom and bathroom. The property is indeed historic, but we work to keep the linens and interior updated regularly to keep the rooms feeling comfortable and fresh. We hope to have the opportunity to provide you with a much improved stay in the future!
We booked our trip through Hotwire. We have excellent results through this website and this trip was no different. We arrived on a Friday morning and we treated like gold throughout our entire stay. LocationThe location is a little far from the Magnificent Mile shopping area but is totally walkable. It took us about 20 minutes to walk up Lasalle and down Wacker to Michigan. Great to get the previous nights cobwebs out of your head. In addition a short walk east on Randolf will bring you to Millennium Park which is were you can find the Chicago Bean and other great attractions. This hotel is smack dab in the middle of the Theatre District so make sure to catch a show while you are there. RoomsWe were able to stay in one of their King rooms which was amazing. We stayed in Rm 1106 and would recommend this room to anyone. It is smaller but plenty of space for clothes and amenities. The room has an iron and ironing board, huge TV and an amazingly comfortable bed. It was extremely clean throughout. Lobby and Hotel AmenitiesWe didn't spend a whole lot of time in the hotel, but it was very nice. Great lounge off the lobby for sitting and relaxing with a drink, surfing the web or finishing up some business. The bar was nice and every night from 5-6 they have free wine sampling.StaffThe front desk staff were great!!! Very helpful and efficient. The house cleaning staff was also quick and efficient and always said hello. Overall this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.Thanks for the comprehensive review of our hotel LuckyPine6! I'm delighted to see there were several aspects of your stay that you enjoyed and were able to take advantage of our amenities! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we hope to see you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
The Kimpton Hotel Allegro is a recently renovated older but well maintained Art deco hotel with an excellent location in the downtown/loop area of Chicago. Hotel features funky styling, rooms are small but tasteful in design and layout. Think NYC or European size small with respect to rooms. Clean, comfortable bed, fridge/mini bar in room with in room safe. No coffee makers in the room, but coffee and tea and newspapers available in the lobby, even at 5 am. Nice. Comfortable seats in lobby. Free wifi is available if you are an IHG member or join IHG rewards club. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Complimentary drink (Proseco or Sangria) upon check in. Nice touch. Check in is on the second floor Starbucks on ground floor. There is valet parking, but its pricey. You can park across the street in public lot. Prearrange with Spot Hero to save yourself some money. Great location within walking distance of many great attractions, shopping and restaurants. If youre in the mood for Chicago deep dish pizza, the mecca of deep dish, Lou Malnatis is a short walk (8-10 min) down the street away on North Wells. Millenium Park, Art Institute of Chicago, great shopping all close by and within easy walking distance. Overall, good value for the money and would recommendGlad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!
Staff was great. Room was clean and comfortable. Earplugs were left because the construction may be loud, but we didn't have any need for them. Love the wine hour. Love the coffee and tea hour in the mornings. They gave a nice amount of towels and the robes were great. We like Kimpton hotels because each one is different. This one had some nice Art Deco touches. Loved the pretty, cozy spaces in the lobby.Glad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!
Spent 45 minutes booking directly with Kimpton, with another 15 directly with the hotel only to discover 30 seconds on TripAdvisor would have yielded a better rate. An no, they don't price match, they just talk around the problem. We arrived to find a room so tiny it didn't even have a closet. We inquired, and I guess closets are for higher level Karma members. Only one robe was met with a promise that we wouldn't be charged for the second (Want a robe each Stay elsewhere.) The nightly screaming and partying from the neighboring room was not met with a room change but an lecture on how thin walls are in Chicago. The second night required security (twice) and no offer of a room change. We shortened our stay because it was so awful the dog, who is the greeter for an internationally known corporation and no stranger to noise, was so tired he couldn't walk, drink or eat. Bringing a dog to this hotel isn't a perk, it's animal abuse. My daughter was so tired and stressed because she was giving a presentation, she started to cry. Now for the amenities: there is coffee in the lobby in the morning because there are no coffee makers in room. Want tea in the evening Go buy some. There is a 10 in room certificate for Karma members, but that's 1 per stay, and the bottled water isn't free, it's 9. Want bottled water Try Walgreens. There is, like most mid level hotels, a wine reception from 5-6 ( shorter than most chains) but unlike most chains, there aren't even pretzels. Want a piece of cheese, fruit, vegetables or a chip Again, Walgreens. If you think this is a boutique hotel interested in offering a great vacation experience, you are very wrong. This is a for profit entity interested in warehousing corporate employees for a profit. There are two reasons to stay here: one is if your company is paying and you don't have a choice (you will then earn your road warrior status) or if there are absolutely no other rooms available in the entire City of Chicago. And then, check TripAdvisor for the best rate. And if there's a problem, don't waste your time complaining or going to management or even contacting corporate. This is a corporate hotel that caters to corporations. Individuals are irrelevant. You will get lip service but they truly couldn't care less.Thanks for taking time to provide feedback from your stay. We're sorry to see you had a less than excellent experience and would love to discuss the issues you experienced further, as this is certainly not the norm for our property. Please feel free to reach out directly at your earliest convenience to discuss. Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to hearing from you.Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
