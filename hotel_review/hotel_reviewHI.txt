great hotel, a bit old, but right in the thick of Waikiki beach - I totally would stay here again! The rooms are a bit small our balcony faced away from the beach, but still - a great deal for a nice simple room!!!!
This hotel was excellent value for the money and we had a sea view as well. It is very well located in the centre of the activity. It is very handy to good breakfast places as well as other restaurants.
Best spot on Waikiki - the views are magnifient. Staff are lovely. Rooms recently renovated. Prices reasonable. Close to everything. Able to watch the Hula shows from our balcony. Hoping to go again next year and wouldn't stay anywhere else.
This place is nice and simple and is so close to everything. When we come back to Hawaii we will definitely be staying there again as the price was so good. The staff were also very helpful and the rooms were very clean.
We booked this hotel literally the day we flew out from Australia, as our original flight to Bali was cancelled due to the volcanoe, so suddenly we found ourselves being flown to Honolulu instead.

We love staying here as the location is fantastic. Very laid back with a good vibe. We stayed 7 nights and loved our room. The only issue that didn't make it a five star stay was that the WiFi was down for 3 days. This made it difficult to book restaurants, check our flights and generally keep in touch.

We stayed here for six nights in December. The porters on arrival were excellent. We arrived with a rental car and the porter told us exactly where to take the car to return it and took care of the luggage straight away.We wanted to see the ocean from the room so booked an ocean-view room. We were allocated an ocean view room in the Pacific Tower. I knew from the reviews that the partial ocean view rooms only had a view from the balcony, but I thought that if we paid the extra for the ocean view we would see the ocean. This is not the case. So I have no idea what the difference is between partial ocean view and ocean view except the price.So on arrival into our ocean view room, I wasn't happy, so I called the desk and was told I would need to upgrade to an ocean front room if I want to see the ocean from the room. So we paid the extra and upgraded. We were allocated room 619 of the Ocean Tower. The view from the ocean front room was beautiful as you would expect. Great view of the gorgeous sunsets and we left the doors open of a night to hear the ocean which was really nice. Unfortunately every morning at around 4am a couple of people (possibly staff) decided to have a loud conversation on the beachfront right below our room.The rooms in the hotel are very nice, in excellent condition, with good sized bathrooms (shower is over the bath), in a good location.The lobby is lovely, the staff are friendly. Our room wasn't serviced on one of the days, so I called the front desk and they sent someone to service the room.The pool was absolutely freezing. I was really looking forward to having a swim, but it was just too cold. However there is a very hot spa pool. The pool service is good, with staff offering bar service.The restaurants in the hotel were good. I have reviewed them separately.
We were recommended this hotel from several groups of friends that have been there before. Let me just say they were spot on. An outstanding hotel with great friendly staff right on Waikiki beach. The room was huge with plenty of room for a family of 4 ( 2 teenagers ). Close to great food and shopping. Will be staying there again. Aloha Brett1975 and Mahalo for taking the time to compliment our hotel and give us five stars. Im delighted to read that you enjoyed your huge room and that it accommodated your family well. I am glad to read that you found our location and staff to be outstanding. Until we meet again- A Hui Ho!
I stayed here for 6 nights. It is a beautiful hotel and the rooms are pure luxury. I wasn't impressed with the outside bar as far as service goes but they had a great deal for breakfast (only 7) which is cheap for Honolulu. The only other complaint was that in one of the restaurants in the hotel that has a bar you couldn't eat there. You had to sit at a table. I was traveling alone, therefore, I like to sit at a bar and have something to eat. It is in a safe neighborhood compared to some of the other hotels. If I want to make another trip one day to Honolulu, I would definitely go back there.
This is the third time we have stayed at the Reef. We stay in partial ocean view rooms and twice stayed in the Ocean Tower and once in the Pacific Tower. Both are very nice and rooms and hotel are all newly renovated to a high standard with quality furnishings. The hotel has great restaurants, The Shorebird, Ocean House and Kani Kapa Grill. All have beautiful food and great ambience. The pool is good and clean and of course you are literally on the beach which is a lot quieter than at the main Waikiki beach. The Boardwalk shops and restaurants are a few minutes walk away and have a great selection of shopping. Recommend these restaurants - Cheeseburgers, Ruth Chris Steakhouse, P F Chang as well as hotel restaurants. A walk up Diamond Head is worth it and the submarine tour which leaves from the Hyatt nearby. Hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms and restaurants etc are great. We will stay here again. We recommended this hotel to other friends who enjoyed their stays here as well.
All of our requirements were met at the hotel, and my wife and I were very grateful to the friendly staff at the hotel. I wish that I knew the names of the staff members at the reception area with whom we had contact, so that I could commend them, individually... but, anyway, they were all obliging and helpful. The breakfast area staff and housekeeping staff (esp. Vilma) were great, as well. The hotel's location (in the center of Waikiki) was good, too. If I had to criticize anything at the hotel - (1) the egg preparations at breakfast could possibly be better and more varied (from day to day) and there could, maybe, be more breakfast meat options (instead of just the alternating bacon-and-sausage option) and (2) the shower/tub in our room was a bit dated (although it worked OK, and was never a real problem).Aloha Jerome S,Mahalo for staying at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel. I am glad that you enjoyed your renovated room and our fantastic location within a short walk of all that Waikiki has to offer as well as several convenient transportation options right at our doorstep. Our friendly staff is legendary for their Love Aloha and I am glad that you enjoyed their warm hospitality. We are currently renovating our bathrooms and I would be very excited to have you came back and see the finished product. I hope we see you again soon.Love Aloha,Kai
This boutique in the heart of Waikiki was excellent. The newly renovated rooms are clean, modern, and nicely furnished. A shout out to Will who made our stay at Gateway so special!! Will told us about some local restaurants and pointed out places nearby that we could visit. I am from SC and my friend is from Georgia. We really appreciated Will's Southern hospitality. Can't wait for a future visit to Waikiki and I'll be sure to book my stay at Gateway!Aloha kbsuarez,Thank you so much for staying with us and taking the time to share your experience. It warms my heart to hear you recognize Will. Our unbeatable staff strives to fill every guest's stay with Love Aloha team members like Will make this happen every day. We can't wait to see you again.Love Aloha,Kainua HopkinsGuest Experience Manager
Wonderful stay, location was great, close to bus and trolley stops. Only a short walk to the beach. Rooms are good with a very comfortable bed and lovely view. I struggled to use the coffee machine, but staff were all very helpful. Great to have breakfast included. Wonderful and friendly staff. I would book at Waikiki Gateway Hotel again.Aloha,Our incredible staff and unbeatable location are just 2 of the reasons that the Waikiki Gateway Hotel is the place to stay in Waikiki. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. Mahalo for choosing the Waikiki Gateway Hotel we cant wait to see you again.
This small hotel seems very hip and stylish, with plenty of attractive areas for lounging. The building wraps around a courtyard, and once you enter the premises you are sheltered from the busy city. There's an interesting restaurant and bar on the premises as well...More
First time visiting Hawaii and booked the Shoreline Hotel, I can't fault it at all position is awesome 2-7 min walk to everything you need from restaurants, shops, bars, beach etc... Stayed on the fourth floor, rooms are very clean and bed was so comfortable. Grab and go breakfast is great with muffins, bars, coffee, tea to go. Small issue with tv which was fixed in less than five minutes.Excellent staff always willing to help, with directions things to see made my first trip to Hawaii very easy and enjoyable. Big shout out to Yianni, who was very helpful with his knowledge around the island.Already planning my next trip and booking The Shoreline again.. Keep up the good work guys!!!Aloha!Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor! We're thrilled you enjoyed your stay with us and I'm sure Yianni is tickled knowing he made a difference in your stay. When you're booking your next Hawaiian getaway, we hope you'll choose to stay with us again!Mahalo
We have been to this hotel probably about 3 times but this time our room was very small so a little disappointed. Luckily we are not there too much so it was ok. Rooms were cleaned late in the afternoon usually after 3pm so if we were out during the day it was a little unlucky that you couldn't rest until your room was cleaned because you would be woken. Rooms were clean bed was comfortable and staff were friendly. I think when you want them to book you a shuttle and you have a coupon that is cheap it was suggested that the shuttle company was unreliable so recommended who they used which was a bit more expensive. The water for the tea and pre made coffee was not hot enough in the foyer so I would always check first and if not hot enough the staff are able to get hot water for you out the back from a room which wasn't a problem for them. The hotel is situated in a side street which is quieter but close to everything. To catch a trolley was easy you just walk down the laneway next to the hotel and you are at the DFS where they start from so you would get a seat .Aloha,Thank you for your feedback! I am happy to hear you enjoyed our location and your time with us in Hawaii! on behalf of our team i would like to say thank you for being our guest,and we hope to see you for future travels.Mahalo,Palaie PT TiaAssistant Front Office Manager
Excellent staff and cool boutique atmosphere that can't be found elsewhere in Waikiki at a fair price. Room was small but nicely designed and was exceptionally clean, which was all that we could ask for. Be sure to check out the restaurant they share a building with for sone great grub!WOOO HOOO! We LOVE your FIVE STARS! Mahalo for sharing your short and amazing review with us... I will print this out and share with the entire team. A hui hou (until we meet again)!
This hotel offers everything you need for a seaside stay without the huge crowds at the other hotels. A 2 minute walk to the hotel strip, it's location was top notch and the staff so friendly and helpful.Aloha Ian402014,Thank you for staying with us! We are so happy that our top notch location as well as our friendly and helpful staff exceeded your expectations. It was our absolute pleasure to accommodate you and yours during your Hawaiian holiday. We appreciate your 5 star review and please come see us again. Happy travels!Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
I received a good service in Shoreline hotel. The room is as clean as new. The staff is very nice as family. The shampoo and hair conditioner is very is great. And there is one thing I want to share. I parked my car the first night here, they refund me the parking fee in the next day when I find a cheaper parking lot near the hotel next day. Then they phoned me that my car will be towed away if I parked illegally, which made me very touched. Overall, execellent service , reasonable price.I will recommend it.Aloha,Thank you for your kind words and 5 star review on Tripadvisor. We are pleased to see that you had an enjoyable stay and that we were able to exceed your expectations. If your travels bring you back to the area please consider another stay with us. Thank you once again for your review, we hope to see you again.Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
If you are not looking for a resort hotel, but looking for a hotel in a great central location, with nice, clean rooms and efficient service, look no further than the Shoreline. We had seven nights here in May 2014 and really enjoyed staying there. It is a cute little hotel, modernized and very comfortable. The bed and pillows were great and I am very fussy! We had a view of the disgusting building next door, and a tiny peep of the sea! Honestly, given the quality of the hotel, the cost, and the little time we spent in our room, it was not a big deal. Why would you pay for a resort hotel and view when it appears you can use the facilities of the pools on the beach anyway during the day. If we ever return to Waikiki, we will be staying at the Shoreline again.Aloha Megan FThank you for your 4 star review. We are thrilled knowing we exceeded your expectations and were able to provide a memorable stay. While it is true we are not a bigger resort our hotel more than makes up for it with our centralized location, complimentary amenities, and competitive room rates. Not to mention our hotel does not charge any resort fees that bigger hotels charge. While it is unfortunate that the view from your room was not to your liking our city view accommodations face the surrounding areas of where this building is placed. For your next trip please consider booking one of our partial ocean view rooms. Thank you once again for your kind words we hope to be able to accommodate you once again.Mahalo,Daniel Floren,Front Office Manager
Great hotel!!! I would love to stay there again!!! Central location- Short walk to everything. Roof top pool as well. This was a fantastic hotel with no hotel fees too. Friendly Staff and free fairy floss from 3-4pm daily!!! how could you beat that!!! Aloha!Thank you so much for the 5-star feedback! We're delighted you enjoyed your stay with us and it sounds like you were a fan of our hotel's location right in the heart of Waikiki. When you're booking your next Hawaiian getaway, we hope you'll choose to stay with us again!Mahalo
This hotel was nothing fancy but it was clean and newly renovated. The decor was really funky and tasteful. The room was quite small but we didn't spend much time in it anyway. Bonus: the bed was really comfortable and we got free beach towels everyday. The restaurant next door was really tasty and had nice staff.Aloha Jaime S!Mahalo for taking the time to post such a nice review! Sometimes it's the simple joys of life that set a hotel apart from all the others and that's exactly what we are trying to accomplish here at the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki, a Joie de Vivre hotel. I am so glad that you enjoyed the decor and found the bed to be really comfortable! I hope the next time you visit Waikiki, you will come back to stay with us.Mahalo!Brian AkerDirector of Rooms
I've stayed here before, so was happy to know the great atmosphere of the hotel has continued. The staff were very welcoming and helpful, and seem to have mastered that spirit of aloha. The location is convenient to beach, the bus tour pick-up points, and shopping areas. The restaurant just next door is called Heavenly for a reason! My room was quiet for sleeping, and had everything you would need while on holiday...for anything else, there's an ABC store down the block!
My husband and I just returned home after staying here for 7 nights. We stayed in a king size room which was nice and spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We also had a small fridge and microwave. We stayed on the 6th floor which was pretty quiet. The reception staff are very warm and welcoming, and there is free tea/coffee/chilled water/pineapple iced tea in the lobby 24/7. The housekeeping staff are also very friendly, always saying 'Aloha' when you cross their paths. The location is FANTASTIC, with the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Centre at the end of the street and restaurants/cafes all within a few minutes walking distance. The new cafe that has opened up next door called 'Heavenly Cafe' is a good spot for breakfast. Try the pulled pork with eggs.......TO DIE FOR!!! Thanks to all the staff at The Shoreline for a wonderful stay.......made my birthday very memorable.Aloha statsmarty, Thank you for choosing our hotel to celebrate your birthday. We are glad to see that our great location and friendly service was able to make a memorable experience. Each of our staff members excel in showing our guests the Aloha Spirit unknown to those not from Hawaii. Please share your experience with your friends and family and tell them of the great things the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki has to offer. We hope to see you again happy holidays.Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
Shoreline hotel is Very Very clean, their were no bugs, the staff were awesome, best location which is one block from the beach and close to all the shops!!!! We will definitely be staying at this hotel again. Aloha!Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback with us on TripAdvisor! We're delighted you enjoyed your stay with us and I'm personally glad our staff took great care of you. When you're planning your next Hawaiian vacation, we hope you'll choose to stay with us again!Mahalo
This is a great little boutique hotel with an excellent Waikiki location. All of the staff are friendly, attentive and very helpful. Stayed in a lovely, very quiet room and in three nights never heard any noise from adjoining rooms. Would book again and highly recommend. Thank you!Aloha Suzette777,Thank you very much for your 5 star review! We are thrilled to see that you enjoyed your stay with us. It was our absolute pleasure to have you at our hotel and your kind words will be shared with our staff. All of our staff knows that they are the heartbeat of the hotel and all love accommodating our guests, all the while showing their own unique Aloha Spirit. If your travels bring you back to Oahu please consider a second stay with us. Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
Plenty has been written about the location, so I'll just confirm, it's centrally located in Waikiki (close to shopping and restaurants) but not to the beach. Our flight arrived very late evening and we had booked a King with a City View. We were checked into a very dark room on the 2nd floor with no balcony. Given that we were staying 4 days here, we really wanted to change rooms and called the front desk but were told there was no other room available, although we asked if we could move in the morning, we were given a very non-committal answer. Given we had just had a very long flight, we just decided to accept our fate but were not happy. The next morning, we were up early and spoke to Mona at the front desk. She was AMAZING! Unlike the service we received the night prior, she immediately started looking for an alternate room for us. She asked us regarding our plans for the day, and did her utmost to offer us an alternate room before we began our day's activities. She provided us with a few options and we were moved about 1 hour after speaking with her (the previous guests had just checked out and Housekeeping was starting on the room). We were moved to a Partial Ocean View (upgrade) with a Queen bed (small downgrade). Despite the new room only having a queen size bed, it was on a much higher floor (ie brighter!) with a tiny balcony. Location IS great but had it not been for Mona's warm hospitality and service, and the move to the new room, I can say that I would NOT have recommended this hotel. The room we stayed in made all the difference! FYI: the room itself comes with 2 small water bottles (upon initial check-in only). Amenities in the room include a small fridge and microwave. Free wifi. Lobby always has chilled water and pineapple iced tea, coffee / hot water, apples (usually), newspapers and a business centre. The hotel can arrange for an airport shuttle (cost 13 per person) on a smaller shuttle generally fewer stops. The pool is tiny and although it is on the rooftop - only has 4 sun loungers so these were often taken. My recommendation to management would be to also include some chairs (I do recognize it is a small surface area so there is not a lot of terrace room). Traveller tip: make sure you upgrade your room to one that is on a higher floor (so you don't need to see the nasty building next door) and get more of that Hawaiian sunshine you've come for!Aloha Frenchie,Thank you for your review. Traveling can be very difficult to many and although you were not pleased with your initial room Mona was more than happy to move you into a room more to your liking! Many travelers that stay with us simply use our hotel as a central home base if you will so that they are in the middle of everything without paying the exorbitant prices that many Waikiki hotels charge. Nonetheless we are pleased that you made the best of your Hawaiian vacation, happy travels.Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
Excellent staff and location . I enjoyed my stay at this hotel . Fresh infused water and coffee all day long . Beach and restaurants at walking distance. specially Josh was very kind and helpful, answering all my questions !
We recently visited the Shoreline Hotel in Waikiki and we would have to say that it was a great experience. My wife and I have both been to Hawaii several times before so we were not looking for a resort experience and were in town for a wedding. We needed a comfortable, quiet hotel that was conveniently located. This hotel was perfect for all of the requirements. It's located in the middle of Waikiki, easy to walk to all of the shops, great valet service, very friendly and helpful staff (ask for Kristy, she was the best!), and clean and comfortable rooms (By the way, the beds are very comfortable). The overall experience was perfect and extremely reasonably priced! My wife and I would definitely come back and stay again!Aloha jeckees!Thanks for the perfect review! Kristy at the Front Desk was especially flattered when she read your comments. Thanks for recognizing her! I agree that she truly is one of the best. You will have to escape your cold New York winter and come for some more perfect weather here in Waikiki! We would love to have you back again anytime!Mahalo!Brian AkerDirector of Rooms
Our Agent booked us 5 nights at the Shoreline Waikiki at the end of February and it did not disappoint. Great boutique style hotel in very good location and lovely staff. Special mention to Josh and Venus who were so happy to help. Whilst the rooms (we had 721) are not luxurious they are very clean and comfortable with all the promised amenities including good Wifi. The complimentary grab and go muffins and health bars at breakfast were very convenient for early starts and very tasty. Infused waters and 24/7 coffee and tea in Reception also great. Used the roof top pool area on a couple of afternoons after sightseeing. Also borrowed the chairs from reception for the beach which is only a short walk away. For info there are self-service laundry facilities at the Coconut Waikiki, the sister hotel a short walk away, again very helpful reception if you need change for the wash machines. Breakfast wise we did use the Heavenly Restaurant next door which was very nice but also very busy. Most days we used the Dukes Lane Market Eatery around the corner on Kuhio Avenue which catered for all tastes. Certainly lived up to its good Trip reviews.
This hotel was amazing,I'm so glade we ended up going with this one.The location is great it is only a minutes walk to the strip with all the restaurants and the beach,and the bus stop is also right there too. The Hotel may not be on the beach line, but it doesn't need to be as it feels so close.Would certainly stay there again. Aloha Kevin G!Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Shoreline during your recent vacation. We're happy that the hotels centralized location worked well for you and the activities that you had during your stay being that we are just a stones throw away from the beach and Waikikis shops and restaurants. We hope to see you again the next time you visit Oahu.Mahalo,Daniel FlorenFront Office Manager
The other reviews here on Tripadvisor are very accurate, and helped us choose this hotel, hopefully I can add some additional comments of value. The hotel is super clean, modern and up to date. That it is actually an older building is completely invisible unless you look really hard. The front desk staff are all super nice and accomodating.Valet parking is the way to go. 2/day more than finding your own, the cars are kept right at the back door of the lobby, and a valet was always available. Worth every penny.The rooms are compact to be sure, but hey, you're in Hawaii, and you need to be outdoors! The rooms reminded me a lot of a typical cruise ship in square footage and furnishings, which is a compliment. Like a lot of european hotels, the A/C is controlled by your room key which you insert into the light switch next to the door. Took a moment to figure that out, but once we did, it was nice, helped keep us from losing our key, and I appreciated the energy-conserving feature. Yes, there is a truly crappy building that needs to be torn down/blown up or something next to it, but its hardly a dealbreaker. The rooftop pool is nifty, relatively private and appeared to be as well maintained as the rest of the place. The location is pretty darn awesome for not being on 'the strip'. Short walk to pretty much anything, bus stop on the corner, fun/weird/cheap breakfast place also at corner. There is a bar for anyone's taste or interest within a block or two. Lots of shopping from the lowest to highest end within a block or two. Very eclectic.The attached Mexican restaurant was quite good and reasonably priced.Cab drivers have no idea where this hotel is located. 3 tries, 3 cabs, and they all got lost. Either the recent name change or the one-way street the hotel is on threw them off. We found it more funny than annoying as cabs in Honolulu are plentiful, reasonably priced and driven just as horrifically as in any city.Aloha KurtS84!Thank you so much for the terrific comments and 5-star review! Your comments are very thoughtful and I appreciate you taking the time to post. Our intimate rooftop pool is one of my favorite amenities because you get such an amazing view in a very relaxed setting. Come back and see us again the next time you visit Honolulu!Mahalo!Brian AkerDirector of Rooms

Stayed here due to flight change and required a hotel for one night. Joined the membership program that offers a cheaper rate. Early check in was permitted and much appreciated after overnight flight, the front desk/ check in staff were fabulous with a friendly and informative attitude. We stayed in a corner suite room that was spacious and well appointed with a separate living area and large bedroom that also had a really nice bathroom with shower and bath. It was a lower floor overlooking the pool area-the pool itself was a shallow toddler type design with a slightly deeper jacuzzi attached. It was still popular with sunbathers but unfortunately you can't actually swim. The hotel had live loud music the night we stayed and was clearly audible until around 1030 at night. Higher floors or a room on opposite side of pool would avoid this. Overall a great stay here and even though it didn't have a balcony I'd definitely stay here again. The bed was super comfortable so a great night's sleep was achieved. Hi Nathan T,Thank you for sharing your review of your experience with us at Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach.

This is my first tripadvisor review and I feel I need to share my experience. The hotel and room is renovated and modern but we were assigned to an accessible room on first night which layout made us feel uncomfortable. They changed to a standard room for us next day but that room was not cleaned yet after we came back from the beach at 8pm and they wanted us to wait 30 minutes for the room to be cleaned because they did not have other room available. The guy (I forgot his name but he made me feel like lacks of experience) at front desk kept justifying it is their system issue (which means ok for customer). Even after room cleaned, we found hair on the bed and pillow smells and they only put 1 glass in our room. I choose Hyatt Centric because of their location, modern design and the quality of Hyatt (used to be), but this experience made me disappointed. Their staff definitely needs more training.Hi Brian C,Thank you for sharing your review of your stay with us in Waikiki. We apologize for the inconvenience with your room assignment. We are in one of our busiest seasons and the hotel can regularly be at capacity. We have followed up with our team to ensure we are streamlining all of these processes and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future so we may demonstrate the excellent accommodations we are known for in Honolulu.

i'm a travler from China, it's my fist time here, the paradise, HONOLULU! MARK always help guests a lot! THANK YOU MARK! U really made my stay much better! Sorry for my english, but MARK still paid a lot of patient to help me!
stayed in this very affordable hotel and staff are incredibly friendly. the moment i arrived at the hotel i was greeted with a smile and staff are very eager to help with my questions. would totally go back in the same hotel in the future.
While the room we had was an odd shape, thats all that was strange. The hotel is situated directly off one of the main streets and all you need is right there. The beach is one block away. Staff very helpful.
Rooms appliances are old but service is good. Car park cost you 20 per night. Don't expect much but then again you are not paying a lot either for a room in Waikiki area. In a nutshell, stayable.
The room was one of the largest I hve stayed in that was not a suite. Beds were comfortable, furnishings were tastful. Free internet. All the ladies at the front desk were helpful, knowledgable and friendly. Great value too.
Spent a week at the Pearl, Rowena and of course Harry were special. We tried every day for a week to Stump Harry with our questions. Never did. Facility was top notch, service too.
Friendly staff and cost effective rooms. Check in to check out very fast and easy!!! Room was clean, a little dated but most importantly clean. Overall a good stay and I will very likely stay there again.970geraldi, Thank you for writing a review of our hotel. We love having locals stay with us - we hope you had a great stay in Waikiki and will visit again from Kailua soon. A Hui Hou, Liz G.
The resort is extremely conveniently based just a block off the sea-face, in main wai-kiki. Its easily accesible to the beach, shopping, touristy spots and the general store. The rooms were large and spacious (for a reasonable price) and were well maintained, stocked (iron/safe/dryer) and...More

We were walking along the beach and were hungry. Nice lunch right beside the pool. Grilled cheese was amazing and the Caprese salad is quite good as well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.
Stayed a week in the very comfy condo with our two daughters (11 13). Room was set up with two king suites and living/kitchen in the middle. Nice balcony with outdoor dinning set up. Fully equipped kitchen and several community grills on the property. Grocery is walkable (15 min) and beachfront boardwalk is great for morning exercise and evening strolls. Several restaurant options walkable. This part of the island was nice for us - short drive to Whalers Village for shopping and restaurants and short drive to some great bays and beaches for snorkeling/swimming. Pool was nice and beach in front of hotel was OK, but kind of steep and a bit rocky. This is a new property and I think it is one of the nicest family suites we have stayed at. We felt their introductory pricing available now was well worth the price for the quality and type of environment.Aloha Peter B,Mahalo for your review and feedback! We are excited to hear your kind words and want to thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We are happy to hear that you were able to enjoy the sun, sand, and boardwalk of the resort. Again, we appreciate your feedback and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future. A hui hou! (until we meet again)
We have stayed at Westin Nanea as part of Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) program. They did try to sell us a time share but they were not too pushy and we have declined an 1.5 hours presentation this time. We stayed at Westin hotel and spa and Westin villas before in Kaanapali area but this was our first time at Westin Nanea Villas. It was a very spacious 2 bedroom apartment with brand new appliances and big TVs in every room. If you skip room cleaning you can get free breakfast buffet worth 29.The beach with coral reef is one of the best on Maui for snorkeling but maybe not for swimming but we still enjoyed both. They have a lot of activities for kids (big and small). My 14 years old and her friend attended Puka shell and Tide Dye lessons for a little fee. There are Lei making lessons, Hula dancing. learning Hawaiian language and many other activities.We were quite disappointed in a pool area. First of all, why do you need so many islands in a middle of the pool They take a lot of space and don't really have any purpose. There is no adult pool nor adult area where grown ups can enjoy themselves without listening to kids' screaming all day long. During weekend, pool and grill areas were occupied by locals who'd bring big lunch boxes with food and alcohol, and listed loud music from a boom box. If you want me to spend 60K on a timeshare here I want my vacation place to be more private, more exclusive.Aloha IrinafromSeattle,Mahalo (thank you) for your feedback of your stay here with us at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. We are thrilled to hear that your 'ohana (family) were able to participate in our cultural activities able to take home a memorabilia from Nanea. We also appreciate the gift of feedback provided in regards to our pool and grill areas and will most certainly look at way to improve the guest experience. We look forward to welcoming you back to The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas in the near future. A hui hou (until next time)
We had unbelievable care and service while staying here. We were delighted and shocked when they upgraded us to a BEAUTIFUL 3 bedroom condo looking over the ocean. The kindness of the staff blew us away. The bell men were always so gracious and timely in helping us with our luggage. The people cleaning our rooms were always so nice. The pool was great with a nice restaurant right there. The facility was clean and spacious. Lovely surroundings. Loved everything about it!Aloha dkramer17Mahalo for taking the time to share your experience with other travelers! We are very pleased to hear that you enjoyed yourself and that you appreciated the services of our bellmen and housekeeping team, they truly are outstanding teams and I know that they will be overjoyed when I share your review with them. Have a wonderful year and we hope to see you again. A hui hou!
We are frequent Westin villa travelers and are very impressed with the Nanea! The villa itself is very modern and unlike many of the other villas we have been to - has a full oven ! So you could make many meals and bake throughout your stay. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The pool area is lovely although a bit small it does have a nice area for those with really little ones but we found it very relaxing ... ( there werent a ton of kids running around and loud) if you want even quieter adult time - there are a couple of plunge pools and many lounge chairs much further back from the larger pools where kids typically are. We are in a one bedroom premium and even though it is only the 2 of us there is a large dining table on the patio that seats 6 and in the kitch ( also seats 6) which would make it easy to entertain friends or family in one spot. Overall just a gorgeous property and we will definitely come back! Aloha Jenofwaukesha,Mahalo for your review. We are delighted that you are impressed with all that our property has to offer. Our wonderful staff is trained to anticipate and accommodate any and all guest needs. We cannot wait to have you return to our gorgeous property to make more memories at Nanea!A hui hou (Until we meet again)
Beautiful spot on upper Kaanapali. Some of the best snorkeling right in front of the hotel. Service and food was great. Service was also awesome. Ate at the bar by the pool one day and our server was slow........was still nice a struck up a conversation with her and it was her first day/ hour on the job. Considering that we adjusted to just have her bring drinks when she saw ours were half empty. No harm no foul.....ITS Hawaii time.Aloha Christmas P, Thank you for your review. We're pleased you got to dine with us and enjoy the ocean. We look forward to your return. Malama Pono (take care)!
Guest room was very spacious and clean. The kitchen was fully equipped: a large fridge, various cookware/dishes/utensils, a dishwasher, an oven, a microwave, a coffee machine, and even a blender. There was a washing machine and a dryer. The bathroom was very large and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful.There was a small beach right in front of the resort. There was a walkway along the beach so we could stroll to the Black Rock. The parking lot was very spacious and convenient. We were able to buy several kinds of foods at Kauhale Market in the resort. The meals at Mauka Makai Restaurant were excellent.Aloha 2011SK,Mahalo nui loa for posting your review. We are very pleased that your enjoyed your stay at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas and found our staff to be friendly and helpfu. We look forward to your future stays! A hui hou (until we meet again).
Beautiful property - helpful staff - perfect location - easy access to transportation clean beach with easy access from property some restaurants nearby dont miss a nearby restaurant Slappy cakes for breakfastAloha bfergen58, We can't wait for your return! Thank you for your awesome review of the Westin Nanea Ocean Villas! A L O H A!
Large spacious Villas, perfect for Family to stay comfortably. The Staff was friendly and not pushy to sell the Villas. We loved the properties lay out along the Ocean front and it was lovely to see the Whales come down the channel from our pool chaise loungers.Aloha techscout2018,Thank you for your review. Our staff will certainly appreciate your comments. We are excited to hear that we have met your expectations and look forward for the opportunity to welcome you back. We wish you a wonderful upcoming Summer and thank you again for your feedback.A hui hou! (until we meet again)
What a view. The weather was windy and not too good for snorkeling or hiking, but who cares. The newest addition to the Westin Resort Family had little to do to ensure our pleasure. The decor was very inviting but we took a facility Hawiian culture tour and it came alive. The details from the lobby floors, walls and ceilings to the ground plantings have been so thoughtfully completed they noticed for themselves. We stayed in a suite just opened and have no complaint. I so have a suggestion though. It would be good to have an adult only area of the pool and hot tub. Aloha georgesA1682AQ,Mahalo for your review. I am so sorry that the weather was not warm, bright, and sunny like usual but it seems that you made the most of it! We are pleased that you enjoyed all the different cultural elements that are displayed throughout our property. When you visit Westin Nanea, you truly do receive the full Hawaiian experience thanks to our phenomenal Cultural team. We will discuss your feedback regarding our pool and hot tub infrastructure at our next operations meeting. We appreciate your feedback!A hui hou (Until we meet again)
We just stayed here for the first time and have mixed feelings, mostly good. First, the good. The facility is relatively new, having opened in the last couple years. The staff is very nice, pleasant, and helpful. The crew at the front desk was great! We stayed in a two-room villa, which was roomy and had all the luxuries of a nice apartment. We really like the large bathrooms! The snorkeling at the beach directly outside the hotel is pretty good, and even better in front of the Westin Ocean Villas right next door. The beach services manager did a great job of addressing two couples who were extremely loud and spewing offensive and foul language around the pool, and we appreciated her professionalism.However, we found the pool/bar/restaurant configuration at Nanea to be less than optimal. They only have one pool, and it's not extremely large. The result is that everyone is compressed into one pool, including infants in diapers, toddlers, teens, drunk adults, people playing catch with balls, obnoxious people, well-behaved people, etc. The facility has one bar, located one step outside the pool, which means that people bring their drinks into the same pool with everyone else. The TVs in the bar can be heard across the pool area, adding to all the noise. There's one restaurant, which is connected to the bar in the same area. The facility has two hot tubs, both of which are in the single pool. The deck area also compresses people around the single pool with up to three rows of tightly spaced lounge chairs. The overall feeling is a noisy, busy, crowded area that was not very relaxing for us. We spent most of our 'pool' time in another area of the resort that was more quiet and relaxing, but is tucked away into a corner of the facility with no view of the ocean. We have stayed at the Westin Ocean Villas (North and South) in the past and prefer the pool layout in those facilities over that of Nanea, so we will probably return to North/South next time we return.Aloha Brian D!Thank you for sharing such a detailed review of your stay.I will be sure to share your feedback with the food and beverage department, pool service, and all other corresponding departments.Should you choose to return please reach out to a front desk manager to assist with your stay. Mahalo
Was a great trip. The pool is small, wry noisy with all the kids, not for the quiet type. Excellent BBQ area, staff was great, good fitness room. The snorkeling right our front was real nice too. Only drawback to many kids.. SorryAloha Tahoethomas1, Thank you for your feedback. We are glad that you enjoyed our facilities, staff, and our beautiful beach. Mahalo,
Great staff!, friendly and knowledgeable. Rooms and facilities,its were clean. Had a great time with friends. Close proximity to activities we wanted. Next time will bring grandchildren, think they would enjoy the facility.Aloha Gwen K,Mahalo for taking the time to share your experience with us. It is truly wonderful to know that you were so thoroughly satisfied with our resort and we cannot wait to have you back again next year, and with the grandkids!A hui hou!
Stayed here for 3 days first week of March. It was windy and raining most of the time. We stayed at a 2 bedroom suite with view of the ocean.I found the place too quiet and not much to do. You have to drive to Lahaina for entertainment.The hotel offers shuttle service to Lahaina.I guess if you plan on doing nothing, this is the place for you.Aloha lagingpasyal,Mahalo for your review. We are saddened to hear your stay was not to your complete satisfaction. Please accept our sincere apologies that you found our resort was not very fun or exciting. It is wonderful to have exciting Lahaina town nearby!A hui hou! (until we meet again)
We booked with Costco Travel for a one bedroom partial ocean view. The resort upgraded us to a two bedroom partial ocean view. The room was beautiful and a treat for my husband and me, as well as our adult daughter. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The pool area is very popular and I can see how this would be a very busy place in the summer, especially, because it is perfect for children. We appreciated that it was a little more calm at the time we booked. The room is very spacious, well appointed and comfortable. Having a kitchen is very convenient. In addition, because of tropical storm Olivia we requested to extend our stay by one night. The resort not only extended but allowed us to retain our room, which we greatly appreciated. The few meals that we ate on site were great, especially the pool bar when we first arrived. The breakfast buffet, as others have mentioned, could be enhanced a bit. But since we had a buffet coupon for not using room service, we felt that offset the food. We rode the convenient shuttle to the Whalers Village and also used their excellent valet services. Being so close to the Whaler's Village and Lahaina, as well as the walking trail alongside the water is very fun. I really wish we'd had more than three nights there. I didn't feel we experienced all that there was to offer in the area so hope to return in the not too distant future. The storm slowed us down for a day, but even people-watching and storm-watching from our room overlooking the pool was fun. Aloha A R!Mahalo for taking the time to share your experience with other travelers!We are very pleased to hear that you enjoyed yourself.Have a wonderful year and we hope to see you again.A hui hou!
The Westin is a great place for families, business and couples. Its beautiful and relaxing. It has everything you would need in paradise. A full size refrigerator is a great plus when your stay is long. I appreciated that there were usb outlets in the night stands and all over the room. Aloha Katie J,Mahalo for taking the time to share your experience with us. It is wonderful to hear that you enjoyed yourself so thoroughly and that you enjoyed your villa. Please reach out to a front office manager upon return so that we may assist with your next stay. A hui hou!
I stayed 3 nights here in a two bedroom suite. It was phenomenal. Two washroom with two separate bedrooms, living room, washer and dryer and full kitchen. They stock the kitchen and provide detergent for laundry. It is great for families or guests staying more than a few days. The resort was very clean and customer service excellent. Everyone was very helpful and nice. Shout out to King at front desk for hooking me up with this upgrade suite. The pool was good size with 3 jacuzzi. I like that its beach front so the kids can bounce from pool to beach within a few feet. We purchased water and groceries at the Times supermarket about 2 mins drive fromThe hotel. They have cooked food there as well. We didnt get a chance to try the restaurants on site so Im unable to comment on them. Theres a coffee shop with some fresh fruits and next the front desk. Coffee is about 4 and decent. Overall i was happy with my stay but when we were checking out, I went to the front desk to confirm my balance and to close my account. I was told my balance was 40, which was right due to 15 parking and some coffee I ordered. Two days later, I see there is a credit card charge on my account for over 1000! The room was prepaid AND I made sure to check my account before leaving. So I have no clue what happened with this. I have left a message and awaiting for a call back to rectify this. The worse part is that I was charged the exchange rate for that day and foreign fee on my credit card when there should have never been this charge in the first place! So in regards for billing I dont know what to say. I would have said make sure billing is right before checking out but apparently that doesnt make a difference as I made sure of my final bill before I left to only be charged 1000. Aloha Mmark 8,Mahalo nui loa for your review. I believe we have your billing error all worked out. We apologize for falling short of our expectations with up to the minute billing. Please reach out to a Guest Service Manager should you need further assistance in this matter. Again we thank you for choosing the Westin Nanea Ocean Villas and for recognizing King for his assistance. Malama Pono (take care) and we hope to see you again.
First time in Maui, could not have been better! We loved every minute of it! This resort stole our hearts. The beach front is wonderful, the hotel grounds a delight. Restaurant a little pricey. Overall excellent.Aloha mburbina, Thank you for taking the time to review our resort. We appreciate you choosing us as your Maui resort destination. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. A hui hou! (until we meet again)
Very impressed with the beautiful grounds, pool, hot tubs and beach. Stayed in a two bedroom, two bath with 5 people. Very comfortable, nice kitchen layout and plenty of grills on property to grill out. Staff was very friendly and helpful, no matter who we spoke with during our stay. Loved the dining table on our balcony with a view of the ocean. We're only sorry we couldn't stay longer this trip!Aloha BktList16,Yay! We love that you were impressed with our grounds, pool, hot tubs and beach. We have shared your review with all team leaders who excitedly shared your review in regards to staff friendliness. We hope to see you in the near future for the longer trip you deserve.A hui hou,Until we meet again!
My wife and I are owners here - and while the GM was fantastic in trying to make our stay right - I really hope the Food and Beverage service poolside is improved before our return next year. We heard from many other couples around the pool that had the same concerns and even the management staff when we commented on it said they knew it was an issue and were working on it. Three different managers said this. That said - Chris (the GM) addressed our concern and was fantastic. The front desk staff, housekeeping and bell staff were also very good. Their service at the Westin North property pool side is much higher at this time and I hope and expect that Nanea will get there soon. When you are on vacation you tend to spend a lot of time at the pool and thus was poor service there really stands out. Thanks Aloha Scott S,Mahalo for your review and your gift of feedback. Our General Manager, Chris Rabang, is always willing to go above and beyond to assure that each and every one of our guests is well taken care of. His leadership is a prevailing factor in our property's enormous success, despite only being open for 7 months. With that being said, we do regret that our Food and Beverage service did not meet your expectations. We will diligently address this issue and continue to improve our service. We hope that you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
Stayed here with the 5 night promo with free rental car. Great promotion! Great hotel for families. Took awesome family pictures with Tiffany from Blink. Free photographer on site-just need to pay for the picture package. It was a great experience. She made it simple and easy. Love the hotel and the amenities. Aloha jina151,Mahalo for your review! We are glad that you took advantage of our Westin Vacation Club promotion. We desire to be the resort of choice for families who need a relaxing getaway. Tiffany from Blinnk Photography is one of the best in the business and takes pride in capturing memories for our valued guests and owners.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
I really enjoyed my stay the room was more like an apartment very well equipped for a long stay my only regret is I was only there for one day on a business trip I truly wish I had more time to enjoy the facilities. Aloha mrgolf55,Mahalo nui loa for posting your review. We are very pleased that you enjoyed your stay at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas and found your villa to be enjoyable. We look forward to your future stays that hopefully are much longer next time! A hui hou!
The staff here are great, very friendly, front desk is efficient, valet parking is well organized. But, it's a resort with lots of young families, so if you're looking for a quiet time by the pool, not gonna happen, although the plunge pool area is noticeably quieter. I don't get why you need a card for towels and you have to sign for reclining chairs at the beach where you have to place a tag. The Westin next door has a bar and casual dining that is closer to the ocean, which we preferred. You can use your room card to charge at any of the adjacent Westin properties which was good.The rooms, which are called villas for whatever reason are very nice, great bathrooms, very comfy beds, kitchens are very functional. The doors to the rooms all slam shut, which was bothersome.You will get asked nice and politely, several times to take a timeshare tour, you can't miss the tours , they are going on al day in a certain pattern like the jungle cruise at Disneyland. Timeshare isn't for me, it's akin to owning a boat, a deep money pit.There is a scent floating around in the lobby, but overall, the people are wonderful and we enjoyed our stay.Aloha sas2kauai,Mahalo for your in depth review. While it seems that we fell short on some of your expectations, we appreciate the compliments regarding our front desk and valet teams. Indeed we are a very family friendly resort, but we do have a quieter pool area in our Napili Courtyard. Thank you for the kind words about our Heavenly Beds and well appointed villas. Please return again to give us another chance to exceed your expectations.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
We had friends stay in a 2 bedroom while we stayed next door at Honua Kai. We spent a lot of time at this resort. The pool bar is wonderful! Though until the new shade comes in, bring sunglasses at sunset. It is brutal. Damon, Cy, Sara and Leigh the server were amazing! Very attentive and helpful to everyone. It was like walking into your neighborhood bar every time we went. Try their happy hour. They make a wonderful mai tai. The resort is clean. The pools looked wonderful though we couldn't find an adult only or quiet pool. Great pool area for kids.Aloha Mommabear04!Mahalo for your kind words about our Inu Pool Bar team. It is so nice to hear that about Damon, Cy, Sarah, and Leigh. They are a wonderful group of people. We hope you come back very soon. A hui hou!
Absolutely beautiful, full kitchen,large tub, beautiful bathroom,bedroom spacious, double bedrooms, was a free upgrade I think, grounds lovely, Last trip was for purely relaxation and destressing which we accomplished.Appreciate the non pressure sales to buy in the timeshare program. You had to go to them, not the the other way around. Already have a timeshare with Westin.No desire to add on more maintenance fees. Definitely would recommend going down to this resort is just lovely down there even though we went on the tail end of the last tropical storm it still is just wonderful .Aloha Mae456,Mahalo nui loa for your great review. We are delighted that you found beauty and relaxation during your stay despite the tropical storm. As you know, we can't have rainbows without the rain and this last storm certain made the most exquisite sunsets and rainbows galore. We look forward to seeing you again and again. A L O H A
We enjoyed our one week vacation with our family. The hotel staff and housekeeping (specifically the housekeeper for our room named Tochi) were all very sweet and kind). Also at the concierge desk Rita was very helpful and provided us with great information and was very sweet/understanding. The pools here were a bit overrated and crowded but overall we enjoyed the beautiful beach, snorkeling, and our nice rooms. Hope we can come visit some time soon!Aloha KitCat1818, Thank you for your 5 star review. We greatly appreciate it. I will be sure that Tochi and Rita is recognized for their amazing service. We are truly lucky to have them as a part of our 'ohana (family). Mahalo nui loa!
This property is beautiful and spacious, with well proportioned rooms and amenities. We were greeted by an enthusiastic King at the front desk, and had a great interaction with our concierge Carolyn. The cultural center was actually one of the highlights that differentiate this hotel from others of the same caliber - we were introduced to the language of Hawai'i for the first time, and it was a fascinating topic. Kudos to Kaimana for the splendid history and language lesson - we highly recommend checking this out!Another highlight is the availability of the shuttle service - we used it almost daily to head to Lahaina or one of the other SPG properties.Now for less savory impressions:The pool bar is not really a pool bar, as you have to get out of the pool and walk across a good section of the dining area to order from the bar. My quip about this may not have been received well, as we were charged 5 apiece for club soda from the tap. I understand that gouging is customary, but seriouslyMore disturbing though is the fact that after heavy rainfall, the boardwalk is flooded and pumps have to be brought out to drain the area. This is 2018, right This is the newest property in Ka'anapali, right They could not have dealt with the drainage during construction Again, seriously My final very minor frustration has to do with the utensils - and I've noted this before at another Westin: The knives in the knife block and the peeler are pathetic. I understand not wanting to have guests cut themselves, but it is more dangerous to use dull knives than sharp ones! And the peeler was completely worthless!All in all though, we have immensely enjoyed our stay, and since it's the first time we have visited Maui in February, we were delighted to be able to sit by the pool, facing the ocean and view the magnificent whales cruising by and breaching right in front of us.Aloha CatofSpade,Mahalo for your review. We appreciate the shout outs for some of our best associates! King, Carolyn, and Kaimana receive wonderful comments all the time for their aloha spirit and friendly customer service. We are glad that you took advantage of our Complimentary Westin Shuttle. Thank you for your feedback regarding our pool bar, our utensils, and our drainage. We will discuss these comments in our next department head meeting. Please return soon to enjoy the magnificent whales again!A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
Perfect family vacation. Resort location was wonderful. Great snorkeling right outside the room. Easy shuttle transportation from the resort to Whalers Village and Lahaina. The staff was very helpful and willing to do whatever necessary. Gorgeous room with a well stocked kitchen. Best vacation in a long time. Aloha ebonniksen!We are so very glad to hear that you enjoyed yourself while staying with us, and that you were able to experience some of our amazing snorkeling on Ka'anapali beach. Mahalo for all of your kindness. Return very soon to build onto these Maui vacation memories. Mahalo nui loa,
My family visited this property in early October. Our visit could not have been more perfect. We arrived to a beautiful resort and welcoming service. We entered our 2-bedroom villa which was spacious, clean and equipped with all the needs our family of 4. The rooms, living area and bathrooms are very spacious and there is even a washer/dryer which will be considered next trip while packing. The pool area is great with an open seating bar and restaurant. We found it difficult to leave the property since it was so relaxing. We picked up groceries so we could make breakfast a couple of mornings and even bbqd one night at the bbqs placed in convenient areas on resort. There were plenty of them for everyone and my hubby enjoyed chats with fellow cookers.Concierge was great and there was even a mini mart available onsite for snacks, coffee, wine, bead, much of what we might need. Id definitely recommend this property for you. Aloha Freedom41639514124,Mahalo for sharing your experience with us and mahalo for your five bubble review! It is great to hear that you had a wonderful time while staying with us. Upon return please reach out to a guest services manager to assist with your next stay. See you next year! A hui hou!
This was our first stay at this resort. We stayed at Westin KOR last year and loved it, so decided to give it a try.We booked a 1 week stay through an owner on redweek. He was wonderful - very helpful in linking our 2 extra nights though the resort so we wouldnt have to move. He did tell me he had requested one of the bldg 8 high floor one bedrooms 1 year in advance, as these have the best view. When I checked in the front desk told me since I wasnt an owner and elite member I did not get preference and I was l placed in a 5th floor room in bldg 7 facing the courtyard and other rooms. They moved us mid stay to bldg 8, but through this I came to find out there are very few 1 bedrooms and they all have poor views or face the pool where loud noise can be heard until late evening. So, if you are looking to book a 1 bedroom beware. Youre better off at KOR where there are ocean front and ocean view 1 bedrooms. Many at Nanea face the parking structure. That being said the rooms are new and well appointed. The shower in the the 1 bedroom was not great... tub with curtain. At KOR they have the nice walk in rain shower, double sinks and a large tub.We did come here the week of Spring break, so expected it to be busy, but it was a bit on the insane side. The pool was packed everyday and seemed over crowded. They seemed under staffed as it was difficult to find a server on the pool deck and it was much faster to go to the bar and order. The other thing we noticed was the lack of cleanliness of the place. Trash everywhere, no one emptying the overflowing trash cans. The lounge chairs were pretty filthy, clearly not wiped down. The beach here is nice, but as others have noted, smaller and rockier than at KOR. We did enjoy snorkeling off the beach everyday with little kids. The waves are gentle and great for learning. We also had spectacular whale action everyday.End game, even though its older we preferred KOR and will book there in the future. Aloha baflier,E kala mai. We apologize for not meeting your expectations. On a personal note, we agree the loyal Elite 5 owner who hosted your stay is wonderful and it was a pleasure assisting him in linking your reservations and providing a room move option for you and your family during your stay. Kindly reach out to our Guest Services Managers should you need further assistance.
New, clean and mostly friendly staff. The pool is not big enough for the resort and want that inviting. Kaanapali and the Resort Spa are better pools. It is says you can share facilities between the Westin properties and Sheraton. That is incorrect. You can not use the pools at Sheraton or Resort Spa which was awkward arriving thinking you could. Pool staff confirmed they get this situation happening all the time. Room service shuts down at 8pm. Crazy for an international brand! When we arrived we struggled to find something to eat.Aloha andrewgemmell,And mahalo for your comment. We are sad to hear your stay was not to your complete satisfaction. We have addressed your concerns regarding pool usage information at the other Starwood properties to our director of guest experience and also spoke with our food and beverage management team in relation to in-room dining hours. Please accept our apologies on the shortcomings you have experienced. We do appreciate your feedback and your experience is important to us. We hope you can join our Westin 'Ohana again upon your next visit.
Check in was very friendly and efficient. Vacation planner Jefferson was great, very efficient and gave us very detailed instructions on all activities we booked. The Concierge desk, Fred, not so much, he acted like he does not want to be bothered. All the facilities and grounds were clean and kept up nicely. This was a very good home away from home. Great location!Room Tip: Ask for a unit on the third or forth floor for amazing view of the Pacific Ocean/ Beach. Aloha Leeza B,Mahalo for taking your time to write such a lovely review.We are glad that you enjoyed yourself so much as to call us a home away from home and that Jefferson provided such nice service.It is exactly the experience we wish to provide to our guests.Although it is unfortunate that you had a negative encounter while you were with us.We will be providing your feedback to corresponding departments so that we may correct it.Malama pono
The new Westin Nanea is the absolute best vacation resort . It has all the amenities you would ever need ,we stayed 2 weeks and loved every minute. We had free DAILY housekeeping,the housekeeper would come to our door every morning to ask when it would be best to do our room. They do an exceptional job and a big shout out for Karen, she is sweet, polite and does an excellent job replenishing kitchen and bathroom supplies when needed.Every person that works on the resort from cleaning staff ,restaurant servers to front desk personelle are terrific!We thoroughly enjoyed every part of being at the Nanea....relaxing at the beautiful pool, walking the boardwalk,whale watching right from along the front of the resort, walking to a grocery store,The Times, to our day excursions in our rental car. Everything on the island is usually an hour or less drive.All I can say is breath taking,absolutely the most beautiful spot on earth!!! Loved it there and hope to return!Thanks Westin NaneaAloha Linda123645,Mahalo for your review! Our villas do come well stocked with everything you could possibly need to make your stay comfortable. We are so delighted to read that you enjoyed your housekeeping service. We invite you to return to the most beautiful spot on earth!A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
We had a private chef over for my husbands birthday and the kitchen amenities and room view did not disappoint. It was comfortable for six people and the hotel had a high chair for our toddler to use throughout the trip. Room cleaning service was prompt daily and proactively called to see if we needed service on the one day we stayed in. Thank you! Aloha 27Lei!Wow! What an amazing experience. I am so happy to hear that you had such a wonderful time while staying with us and that you enjoyed the villa and amenities. A hui hou!
We have been staying at the Westin Kaanapali resorts since 2004. Each resort gets better than the last. Nanea is the ultimate. Keeping the culture of the islands from the lobby to the rooms. Staff is all friendly and helpful. Concierge staff is knowledgeable. Cant wait to be back!Aloha nancyfQ2296HJ,Mahalo for taking the time to provide a review on your recent stay. I cant agree with more the Cultural Center is a great and informative tour that you cant miss as a speaks life to the Hawaiian Culture. We appreciate your stellar review and recommendation to other travelers. We hope to welcome you back soon.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
You would hope that since they have done this two times prior that they would take points from the neighboring villas. Rooms and room sizes aside (fantastic!) the service at this resort in VERY under par so far. We prebooked pool chairs over a month prior and they messed those up. Pool service is essentially none existent.... even when they say theyll send someone. Other then having pre booked chairs at the pool so you dont need to guard some seats at 7:00am dont expect - your money to go further then that. No extra service or help. Actually we had to change chairs 3 times day one as per their screw up. Room service. Also SO SLOW. Over 1 hour for coffee pancakes and bacon. Hoping that everything starts to click. 10 Years coming to the Westin Maui villas and unfortunately not up to the quality yet. Aloha Brittany A,Mahalo for your gift of feedback. Please be inspired to reach out to a Guest Services Manager on Duty should you want to discuss your concerns further. We regret that we were unable to meet your expectations so far, but hope that we may turn it around so you leave us refreshed and renewed.Happy New Year!
Me and 4 of my friends had the privileged of staying in a beautiful 3 bedroom suite. It had a full kitchen (microwave, stove,oven, dishwasher, island and even a walk in pantry!), washer/dryer and 2 large bathrooms. It was the most comfortable stay ever! It was like having a home right on the beach. The resort has a concierge desk, which was very honest in their suggestions of places/excursions for us to go on. They had so many excursions options! We will definitely need to go back again and go on some of the excursions we did not get to go on due to lack of time. We spent a lot of the time just relaxing in their various pools and jacuzzi's or on the beach which we could literally see from the pools. Overall, it was the most pleasant stay that I have ever had, the resort had all you needed for a comfortable stay and there was plenty to do but if you needed to there was also plenty to do in the neighboring city as well.Aloha yqbettyboop,Mahalo for your review! We are pleased that our phenomenal concierge team was able to provide the framework for an excellent vacation on Maui. There are truly so many things to do and see on this world class island. Our 3 Bedroom Ocean Front Villas make our property stand out from the rest, at over 1,600 square feet in size. We are delighted that you had such a pleasant stay with us and we hope that you will return again soon to create more memories at Nanea.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
The resort was fantastic with something for the entire family! The pools were amazing for the kids to play in, the food and drinks were great for everyone, and the suites were perfect for our family. The staff made an effort to go above and beyond to ensure our family enjoyed our stay!Aloha beachkyle11,Mahalo for your comments about our family friendly environment. We appreciate your recognition of the friendly staff. We are delighted to hear that you had a wonderful stay and we look forward to welcoming you back.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
We stayed on Maui for a week with the first 5 nights at the Westin Villas. As Westin Villa owners we could not pass up the opportunity to stay at the new Nanea. Upon check in we were upgraded to a three bedroom ocean front villa - what a treat. Every last inch of the villa was stunning.Kitchen - well appointed with everything needed to prepare former meal. Bedrooms - great layout and comforts. The mast also had the most stunning bathroom.Lani - the best part of the villa was the double lani with a seating area and Dinning area overlooking the Maui coat. Beyond the room the entire resort as amazing. The restaurant offered great food and service. The market had all kinds of great options - from morning coffee to grab and prepare options. The pool areas we awesome with an awesome kids pool and upper adult focused pool. Overall the ray was amazing. The photos speak volumes. There is much to say, but with a single night I can begin to capture it all. We will be back and can't wait to see how things develop. Aloha Kelsey A,Thank you for taking the time out to review your stay here with us at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed our three bedroom ocean front villa. The next time you visit us, please be sure to stop by our Pu'uhonua o Nanea Cultural Center to participate in a 'Olelo (Hawaiian language) class, ukulele, lei making or hula classes. Its so much fun. A hui hou,
Our experience was delightful at the Westin Nanea. We were welcomed by a very friendly staff and actually received a beautiful upgrade as it was our Honeymoon (you always wish for this, but it was such a treat it happened)! We spoke with the Assistant GM who was so unbelievably kind and treated my husband and I to a nice chat and local coffee. We received a complimentary bottle of wine and stunning orchid from the staff for a warm congrats on our nuptials, Everyone we interacted with on staff was really great! We were off the property quite a bit - but can attest to the gym being very clean/lots to do as well as the rooms being a delight. Parking was super easy, and the beach is literally right at the front of the property. There's a little walkway that connects different hotels - so I assume this would be great for a group/family. We enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely come back here if we get the opportunityAloha jennagarcThis is wonderful to hear. We are glad that we provided you and your husband with a memorable romantic getaway. Congratulations on your nuptials, and thank you for allowing us to be a part of this special occasion. We appreciate your kind words regarding our staff and we look forward to welcoming you back to the resort for your anniversary, perhaps.A hui hou!
I booked a massage at the spa and had no idea my therapist would be SOOO amazing. I would highly recommend Cathy for a massage. She was in tune with my aches and pains and went out of her way to help me and even educate me on how to help heal an old injury. I seriously wanted to cry when my session was over. I've had massages all around the world and Cathy was one of THE BEST. Wonderful experience! Aloha,Thank you so much for your feedback on our Heavenly Spa by Westin. We're glad you took advantage while you stayed with us at the Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. And we will surely pass off your kind words to Cathy and the rest of the Spa Helani team.Mahalo, please come back again very soon.
We had a fabulous vacation in Maui in this beautiful resort, Westin Nanea. I was impressed with the 2-bedroom villa, very spacious for a family of 4 with nice furnishings and the heavenly bed was just that - heavenly. This resort is truly Hawaiian, intentionally designed to reflect the culture and history the lobby itself is remarkable with detail in the woodwork, fish baskets, circular posts representing the elements, and so much more. We enjoyed the pool and the view of the ocean beach was walking distance! Happy hour offers good drinks from 3-6. Great customer service staff at front desk greeted us with a smile.Blinnk photography captured beautiful pictures of our family vacation, leaving us with photos to remind us of this special vacation in Maui! We were impressed with the ease of the photo shoot and the quality of the photos. Definitely recommend Blinnk photography! Overall, best vacation ever at the Westin Nanea! Highly recommend. Family friendly, beautiful resort that gives you relaxation and luxury. Thanks for the wonderful service that made our vacation memorable!Aloha Catherine A,Mahalo (thank you) for your review, recommendations, and sharing that your stay at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas was the Best Vacation Ever! We love that you soaked up the sun and our Hawaiian culture. You are so welcomed and we hope to see you again soon. ALOHA!
For a brand new resort, I had higher expectations than I experienced. The Pool area is almost entirely laid out for kids, not adults. The Fitness Center was far too small to accommodate the number of guests wishing to work out in the morning.

This resort was gorgeous. The staff was great. Loved it! The resort was in a place that was convenient to anywhere we wanted to get on the island. We ate the buffet breakfast a couple times- the food was great.Aloha B348XVmichaelh,Thank you for taking the time to review our resort. We appreciate you choosing us as your Maui resort destination. Mahalo for your feedback regarding our breakfast buffet. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. A hui hou! (until we meet again)
This property has an excellent location on the beach, wonderful walking path along waterfront.......The accomodations service of the Westin is one of the best ......Staff extremely friendly helpful both on site in recommendations for local activities on the island......Aloha D2897ZNkathleens,Mahalo for your review!

During our honeymoon last summer we toured this resort and purchased there that day. This is the last new resort to be built here we have been told and it is gorgeous! Recently completed, so everything is brand new and wonderful! The staff is great as is the food, cocktails and all of the amenities! Numerous pools, the main pool is amazing overlooking the ocean! All the water sports you can ask for and fantastic views of the ocean! This is a must stay location!Aloha rsanthin87,Mahalo for your wonderful review of your recent stay here with us at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. We are thrilled to hear that you thoroughly enjoyed the hotel facilities the first time and decided to return. And may I say happy first anniversary as well! We look forward to welcoming you back again in the very near future. A hui hou!
The property is new and you can feel it. Very well designed, equipped and furnished. The atmosphere in the hotel is very nice, the restaurant is good and the pool bar does it work. The rooms are big and comfortable, and no noise will disturb your sleep.The hotel has a shuttle service that connects with some of the most interesting points of this part of the island (including Whaler's Village and an outlet shopping mall).Staff is nice and helpful and the concierge service works in a very proffessional way.Aloha JMP990!Mahalo for taking precious time from your day to provide such a wonderful review of the Nanea and our helpful staff. It is everything we can do to assist our guests in providing memorable experiences. And we are so glad that you enjoyed the complimentary shuttle service as well. Mahalo nui loa.
Fantastic all the way around. Didn't find anything disappointing but the birds that were everywhere and attacking your food. the servers where great. Front office was helpful. Only wish there was water in the roomsAloha Robert V,Mahalo for taking the time to share your experience with us. Your honest feedback is greatly appreciated. We are very glad to hear that you enjoyed yourself so thoroughly and that you had great customer service both from the front office staff and also the wait staff. I will be sure to share your review with them. Upon return please reach out to a front office manager to assist with your stay.A hui hou!
My wife and I had a fabulous time at the Westin Nanea. The accommodations, staff, concierge, and location exceeded our expectations. The property is conveniently located in north Kaanapali, and is close to the shopping and farmers market of Honokowai. The beach in front of the villas featured very good snorkeling, and we both spent hours drifting in the surf. Stephen was an especially helpful concierge, recommending excellent restaurants and activities, and making reservations.Aloha Joe D,We appreciate you taking the time out to provide your review of your recent stay here with us at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. We are thrilled that you and your wife we able to experience the Aloha spirit of our associates. We look forward to the next time your travels bring you back to Maui.A hui hou (until next time)
Its in a lovely setting, right on the beach. The villas are well equipped and you couldnt fail to be impressed. However, my criticism is that it is a high sprawling resort. It takes a while to get your bearings and not just too easy to navigate...You would still find it difficult to be too critical and I have no doubt you will thoroughly this spot. It somehow is a little less thanI expected. I still enjoyed everything. There is a restaurant, bar, market, gym, spa...so all the elements of enjoyment are there...Aloha Michael Denis M,You are so right! We are a very large property. A large pool, two adult plunge pools, three Jacuzzis, our restaurant Mauka Makai, and 8 buildings. I do apologize for the difficulty in navigating but I am gladdened to hear that you still enjoyed yourself so well. I will pass along your feedback in hopes to provide a better experience to you next time. Mahalo,
This is such an amazing place to stay. Rooms and facilities are immaculate. The staff were super friendly and were really helpful when it came to suggestions of places to visit and places to see. Loved the pools and the cafe by the pool too. Aloha janerp2018Mahalo for sharing your experience with us and mahalo for your five bubble review! It is great to hear that you had a wonderful time while staying with us. Upon return please reach out to a guest services manager to assist with your next stay.See you next year! A hui hou!
If a 5 star is the highest rating - I would give Cheryl a 6 star !! She was always friendly and helped us so much with our reservations. We had 3 different reservations as one of us left from a 2 bedroom unit and we were to have to check out of it and then check in to a one bedroom (twice) before we were to leave. 7 nights in 2 bedroom, then 5 and 1 nights in a one bedroom. Without any request from us she upgraded our stay into the same 2 bedroom for the whole stay !! Its hard to describe how much this meant to us !!She is the best and am sure many know that. Earl and Sandi BlackabyAloha eblackaby,Mahalo for your review! Cheryl is a 6 star Front Desk Agent, who's passion is providing exemplary customer service for everyone she comes in contact with. Her goal is to follow in her father's footsteps and become a Hotel Manager someday and she is well on her way. Cheryl takes pride in helping people and making their stays memorable, so it was no surprise that she accomplished that for you.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)
We travel a lot and as SVO members, use a lot of Starwood properties. After only a day, my wife said this has to be her favorite. The people are friendly, there is a lot to experience, and the kids (3 ages 8 to 16) were never bored. The 2 younger ones found instant friends. We did so much that we were all wiped out every night by 8:30. The concierge staff was great at finding us the best deals. One of the things offered was a photography session with Blink. It wasnt on the top of my activity lists, but we hadnt done it in awhile and I knew we might get a holiday card out of it. Tiffany made it fun, quick, and easy. And the pictures came out great. The concierge also booked us a last minute helicopter trip with Sunshine Helicopters to Molokai at a rate that was well below the published rate. We chose them because the price listed didnt have any fuel surcharge* like the others. Snorkeling at Molokini was awesome. Overall, the resorts food, staff, facilities and location are all top-notch. The shuttle service between the Starwood properties and Lahaina is a huge plus. Aloha dencoderek,Thank you for your review. We are so happy to hear that you had a wonderful time and spent time enjoying our most precious gem, Kekaa Beach. Thank you for your kind words about our Concierge staff and Tiffany at Blinnk Photography. I will be sure to share your review with the leadership team. Thank you for grading different areas of the resort. We hope to welcome you back for another great stay. Mahalo, and Be Well.A hui hou! (until we meet again)

We loved Captain Cook and this place is wonderful. You are basically staying on a big back porch among the banana leaves and serenaded by frogs (so not for those who need to sleep where it is totally quiet).

I spent a sleepless nite in an airbnb oven ....it was miserably hot with people coming and going, traffic sounds, barking dogs, on street parking and noisy neighbors.

This is a very good resort. For Wyndham owners, I'd expect you to rank it as average. The view is very dependent on where you stay. Some on the upper levels are drop dead breathtaking. Lower levels not so much. It is quiet and the staff is mostly very helpful, friendly and accommodating. Checking in after dark is really tricky... More
