I called there asking to speak to my husband in the room in which he was staying. I gave the first and last name.

Very conveniently located near the airport and Ft. Bliss. Friendly staff, easy online check in. Excellent breakfast and happy hour. We loved the Texas shaped waffle maker. Suites are generously sized. Only wish the bathroom shower/tub fixtures and surround were updated.Thank you for your kind review. I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay at the Hampton Inn Suites El Paso Airport and will make sure to share your comments with our entire staff! Happy Holidays!
There is absolutely nothing in this town. We needed a bed to sleep in for the week and pet friendly at that, convenient to my hubby's job site. This place was just that. It was verrrry affordable, verrry clean, and close to all the little nothings in town. The owners are very nice and welcoming. Would def. recommend.
My husband and I have been finding different places to stay in Weatherford and this hotel is our favorite. The rooms and spacious and clean. The hotel has a large buffet in the morning and an indoor pool.
Not a very well kept place. Cockroaches had fun traveling around the room and bathroom. Owner thought it was her right to park in the handicap parking because it was convenient for her. Coffee pot did not work. Will not return.
Excellent property, great breakfast Buffett - everything from fresh oatmeal, with all sorts of great choices to add to it- blueberries, nuts, etc. in addition to waffles, eggs, breakfast sandwiches, etc. The staff were top notch, so friendly and accommodating! Would definitely stay here again!

We stayed here on our way to and back from our trip to Colorado. The hotel was clean and well kept. The employees were very nice and helpful. Great value for the price! We would stay here again if in the area.
It was pretty good overall. Our group comes in every year and we always appreciate the hospitality. Also, thanks for the group rate!
I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Tim was very, very professional and genuinely helpful!!! He went out of his stay to make us comfortable. I felt relaxed at this hotel. The beds were very comfortable.
Stayed there for 5 days while on a business trip. There isn't a minibar(fridge) like other Hamptons in the area, but was not a bad hotel. Its clean and quite and overall pretty good. Its not within walking distance to anything, but an HEB is not too far away if you have a vehicle.
Always stay at Hilton properties. Although the property itself was nice and well kept, water pressure caused excessive speer time. There is no microwave or fridge. I will stay at another Hilton property on my next visit to the Valley.
Tim, on duty during our check in, was fantastic! Went out of his way to make sure we were totally satisfied. Our flight from SC to McAllen was supposed to have taken a total of 6 hours. Because of problems with American Airlines, it took over 14 hours. We were exhausted by the time we got to McAllen. Couldn't get... More

Very nice, modern hotel, clean, ok breakfast, close to restaurants - some in walking distance just across the walking bridge. Only complaint would be the location of a/c vents in room. Needed to put the fan on high to push air into sleeping area.
The front desk staff is unfriendly, they don't greet you or say thank you. The housekeeping is the only polite staff they are AWESOME. The breakfast is not all that great. Rooms have a smell to them.
This hotel was very clean and the staff very friendly. It is located right on the highway but is very quiet and a short drive from Corpus Christi. There are a few chain restaurants very close. I would recommend this hotel.
My stay at your hotel was pretty nice. I would have liked a microwave in the room and the corners of the bed frame are sharp. I hit my shins on them a couple of times. I also think there should be something in the room to show what all the hotel has to offer their guests.Thank you for your review. Your comments are most appreciated as it is important to us to know what improvements can be made for a more enjoyable guest experience. We hope to have you back again soon.
However most hotels that cost half as much offer a free continental breakfast. Breakfast here should you have it is very expensive. If all you need is a place to sleep this is not the place for you.
this property I must say was very clean the people were very nice courteous I enjoyed my stay and I would definitely recommend this to my friends and I do plan on staying here in the future
I will start with the only positive. The staff at the front desk, restaurant and bar areas were friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was rather disgusting. The decor is gaudy and dated. Even accounting for that subjective opinion (design styles can differ of course, some of my colleagues liked the ambiance) the cleanliness was lacking. Upon checkin my room had hairs on the bathroom counter and the floor had not been mopped. The bathtub was filthy. The carpet areas were stained. The climate control in the room was terrible. Instead of a thermostat there was the old style manual control box AC unit under the window. It didn't work properly and it was LOUD. So the options were either freezing cold or humid and muggy (considering it was almost 40 degrees and humid in Dallas at the time of my stay). It was near impossible to get a comfortable sleep. The air unit was loud and the only settings available was max or off. I would get too cold, turn it off, then get too hot and in the middle of the night get up and turn it back on. This was repeated all night for the 3 nights I stayed. Suffice to say I slept maybe 4-5 hours in total. I would never recommend anyone stay here unless it was necessary and there were no other alternatives. One other note, be careful if you take the shuttle somewhere. My coworkers and I took a shuttle to a nearby restaurant and told the driver to come back and pick us up by 10pm. Well he never showed and after waiting 15min we called the hotel. That driver had left his shift and not told his replacement. So we were finally picked up at almost 1045pm. That driver was apologetic and it wasn't his fault.
Dirty, tub drain did not drain and brought up stuff back into the tub which is yuck!!! A/C did not pull moisture out of room so everything I mean everything was damp from carpet up. Worse stay I have ever experienced. Housekeeping did not clean outlet room for a two might stay and we had to ask for clean towels twice.Thank you for submitting a review about your recent experience at our property. I wanted to sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered. We take a proactive approach providing our guests with the highest level of service, cleanliness and safety. We hope you give us another chance the next time you are in the North Dallas area.
This hotel is run down. Pics are not as advertised. Very cheap furnishings. Thermostat didn't work along with elevators not working. If you want something equal to a run down super 8 but want to pay a more expensive price than that, then this is the hotel for you.
It's no secret that this hotel is old. Though, Night Hotels did a great job of dressing it up and repairing everything that matters. The furnishings, beds, linens, carpet, and general aesthetics of the common spaces are modern and hip. It's still in a sketchy neighborhood and inconvenient to get to due to construction, but hopefully once that completes, the area will begin to revitalize.
Very outdated hotel rooms. TV did not work - no signal. Called desk, they said change the channel. Why, I don't know. Still did not work, they said they will send maintenance. 45 minutes later still hadn't arrived. Called desk. They said change channel. said we went throough that drill and were waiting for maintenance. Person said she would call as there was no record of the prior call. They came about 15 minutes after and had to replcae cables on tv. Extremely poor food and bar service. Ordered dinner at 10 pm (they serve until 2 am). Food finally arrived at our table around 11:40 pm. No comment from staff or anyone as to poor service. Wait staff contact with table to refill drinks, etc. during wait was once. Had to go to bar and try to flag down bartender if needed anything. Thank you for submitting a review about your recent experience. On behalf of the executive team allow me to first apologize for the service levels you experienced which failed to meet your expectations and our minimum standards. Wyndham sets the bar high when it comes to service standards, understanding the importance of taking extra steps to ensure our valued guests have a wonderful stay. I can assure you, your experience is not typical of the Wyndham Garden Dallas North and hope you give us another chance the next time you are in the North Dallas area.
Great stay! Friendly front desk staff and great service. Will be back to stay. Clean property and big lobby and pool area very clean. Even the guest was friendly and nice. The housekeeping made sure u was happy and satisfied before they left your room.
I did not feel safe at this hotel. Their shuttle took forever to arrive at the airport, took 2 calls to find out where they were, and was so old and rickety I couldn't talk on my cell phone. The lobby night club attracts an unsavory crowd and people are lurking around everywhere. The halls are dark. The front desk is covered with graffiti and the staff couldn't answer basic questions. My room furniture was covered in vinyl upholstery with lights around the bed. Everything is painted black. The bathroom needs a total make-over. Somehow they thought I'd be fooled by a new shower curtain. I didn't even consider eating in the restaurant. If others liked this hotel, I'd question their taste and travel experience. This is not a place for women or children! Leaving was like an escape.We are sorry that you didnt enjoy your recent stay with us. We would like to apologize for any issue you may have experienced and kindly inform you of a few up and coming renovation projects. Our bathrooms and are one of the last phases of our renovation and will be completed over the next 6-12 months. We are changing names to Wyndham Garden over the next few weeks and a few decorative items will also be changing during this transition. We are alarmed to hear you had a poor experience with both the front desk and our shuttles especially since every vehicle in the fleet is no older than a 2012 model. Our restaurant is fantastic and very well known in the area, were sorry you didnt have a better first impression and the opportunity to dine with us.
Hotel was only worth the 50 that we paid through Priceline. The agent that checked us in was rude and didn't want to be bothered. We were in town for the USC/ Alabama game and flew in early Saturday, due to our schedules. We arrived at the hotel at 9am, requested early check in, the agent didn't even look down and said Check in wasn't till 3p I asked if we were able to get an early check in to the reply we can try for 2p at the earliest she didn't even look down at the computer to see if a room was available. After asking if anything was open now, she was able to find an available room. I have worked in hotels for 10 years, and know that rooms are open if you don't sell out the night before which they didn't. Since our flight was early that morning we decided to rest before heading to the stadium, only to be woken by the housekeeper wanting to inspect the room. Hotel in general is dark and gloomy, halls feel cold and hotel looks like a bad 80s hotel. Watch out for platform bed edges at night, I have a huge bruise due to running into the corner when getting up in the middle of the night. Do yourself a favor and pass up this hotel and spend the money on something nicer.Thank you for your most recent stay. We take great pride providing the highest level of service, guest safety and cleanliness. As you know from working in hotels, we can never guarantee an early check in but will do our best in our attempts to make accommodations for guests wanting to check in early. With that in mind, while we may not have sold every room the night before, reservations are often made for specific room types for a reason and we may have not had your specific room type available at such an early hour as checkout is not until 12 PM. We were indeed sold out for the weekend of the game and our team did their best to get the rooms turned as quickly as possible. Hopefully we will see you again for the next game.
I didn't know about this hotel but was pleasantly surprised when we entered into the lobby. The hotel's decor was different from all the other Wyndham's we have visited. I absolutely loved it. The room was very spacious, and I loved the pool area although I don't swim, just to be able to go out in the patio area and sit in one of the cabana's was very relaxing. My only complaint about this hotel is that the exit and entry doors other than the lobby could not be accessed with our card keys. Would I go back again absolutely, and would I recommend this hotel to my friends, I most definitely would.Thank you for providing an honest and fair review! Our pool and cabana area is amazing, and is a highlight that many of our guests enjoy. Our engineers have addressed the issue with the doors to our building and reset the locking mechanism to ensure they are working properly. We look forward to seeing you again soon when your travels bring you back to North Dallas.
I'm a rewards member and when I read some of the bad reviews, I almost didn't stay here, but I didn't see any of the problems encountered by some others. The place was clean, the staff very friendly and helpful, the room was awesome and clean and I will definitely stay here again.
I had the pleasure of visiting this hotel when visiting my daughter who was staying there for training. Yes it is older and halls are a bit dingy but all areas I was in were clean, The decor is very interesting and fun. Pool area is beautiful with private cabanas which you never see at a hotel of this size. Whatever the hotel lacks in appearance is easily made up by the fantastic staff, Everyone from desk, to van drivers to restaurant personnel were wonderful and so accomodating. Shuttle will take you anywhere within 7 miles so we did not ever use a cab or uber and got to many good restaurants as well as the beautiful Galleria mall, however, it does not go downtown. Would definately stay there again,Thank you for providing an honest and fair review! Our pool and cabana area is amazing and our guests always rave about the accommodations. We appreciate your comments regarding our staff and have shared your feedback with the team. We look forward to seeing you again soon when your travels bring you back to North Dallas.
There were no restaurants in the hotel open on Saturday night. I had to go to the Gift Shop to eat chips, candy, for supper. I had no car. You should have a shuttle service to Love Field for pickup. I had to beg for a ride to take me back to Love Field on Sunday morning. I do not recommend this hotel at all.
We spent Sat. night at this hotel after eating lunch at Mary's Caf in Strawn. When I called for a reservation Anne told me she would put us in the Galveston room overlooking Lamar St. but when we got there she put us in the Cisco instead because someone was in the room next to the one we'd been told... More
My husband booked our hotel stay here through Priceline.com. I called a week before our travel date to request a King Non-Smoking Room. The front desk receptionist informed me that the room was already booked for a King Non-Smoking. I informed them that I had spoken with someone earlier and was promised the King room. She wanted to know with whom I spoke. I did not take the young ladies name. Where I come from when someone tells you they will do something they are suppose to do it! They had given away our room and we had to settle for Queen Non-Smoking. They had no explanation or common courtesy to offer for their mistake. This hotel was absolutely Filthy. It smelled terrible. Every corridor reeked of air freshener trying to cover up the unpleasant odors. They do not maintain anything. The lobby, corridor, and elevator was so bad that I actually dreaded going into the room. Every inch of floor was covered with something that needed swept, mopped, or vacuumed. The room ceiling had huge water stains, curtains had some huge black mystery stain on them. The carpet was sticky. The bathroom floor was slippery with God only knows what. The room did not smell fresh at all. The fabric furniture had huge stains all over it. It was so bad I was afraid to put my clothes or belongings anywhere. I ended up removing the comforter and laying it over the sofa so we could put our things down. I did not remove my socks in the room my entire stay. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. The bedding was old, tabby, and scratchy. The pillows were like rough paper. The kitchen was dirty the sink had gunk in the bottom. Floors were not swept well. The A/C unit was so loud it was like a piece of machinery was in the room with us. The person above us stomped their floor all night. You can hear everything through the walls inside. You can also hear everything from the outside of the hotel as well. Very old building that needs an absolute demolition and remodel inside. I have stayed in many hotels in my time, but this one was absolutely disgusting. Then the next morning when we were ready to get the heck outta there the front lobby attendant informed my husband that he needed to pay more for the room. She refused to check us out until my husband paid her. She claimed we had been put in the wrong room. Yes thanks to them we had! Because they gave away our room! We had already paid for our room through priceline. The transaction was complete. She wanted my husband to give her a receipt from the previous afternoon when we checked in. They didn't give us anything at that time. She wanted to know who checked us in so she could scold them. Guess what SHE DID! She would not look at the booking in her system and flat out accused my husband of lying about the fact that he paid through priceline. She told him she couldn't take his word for it. Okay fine, then look into your own computer system the information is there! He had to call me inside from our car and I literally had to pull up the priceline information that she refused to look for herself on her computer from my phone. She was trying to charge us 99.00 dollars inclusive of tax for a room we had already paid for. She still argued with my husband and refused to speak to him directly. She kept yelling the same thing asking who checked us in. Again SHE DID! She was the rudest front desk attendant I have ever dealt with. Finally after she was satisfied with the receipt on my phone, she still held us there so she could call their own help line to fix the problem. She finally let us go and never gave us our receipt from them. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. I don't suggest you do either.
I don't even know where to begin with. I am totally disgusted with the entire experience. My nightmare began as soon as I reach the hotel and find out that my room (which was requested over the phone and confirmed by the front desk staff) was not available. I was given only 2 options, so had to settle for one. The property is filthy, dirty, stains everywhere from carpet, sofa, chairs to curtains and even on ceiling. Bed was very uncomfortable, loud noises from above, corridors, parking lots, creaking floors, slamming doors. Hair in bathroom, extremely loud a/c. The list will just go on and on.The icing on the cake comes the next day morning at checkout, I am asked to pay extra for my room. Rude staff, no sense of customer service whatsoever. I told her that I had booked the stay via priceline.com and pre-paid for my stay. She wanted to look at paperwork, expressly stating that I can't take your word for it, I have to see the paperwork. Insisted that she had all records, but surprisingly couldn't find mine. I refused to pay any extra money and she had to call and change the rate codes. Whatever !!Please save yourself and DO NOT ever stay at this place. I am disgusted beyond words.I appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your experience with us. The cleanliness of the hotel and the interaction with the front desk you described is unacceptable, and I sincerely apologize for your experience. To make sure this doesn't happen again, I am meeting with the entire staff to review your comments and discuss how we can avoid a similar situation in the future. We continually work to improve our hotel, so I really appreciate you providing us with your feedback. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly, at dmcextendedstay.com, should you wish to discuss this further. We would love to have another chance to provide you with a better experience at our hotel the next time you're in town.
nice place. friendly staff. i stayed in a deluxe room for about 2 months and it was comfortable and pretty cheap too. the only bad thing is that it's not in the best location as there's not really a grocery store or decent restaurant nearby.
I was going there for a convention and Hotel Anatole was sold out. The closest available hotel was Extended Stay. Booked it because ratings show 3.5 stars. Well, this is false. This hotel does not deserve more than 1 star. It has roaches, and I killed two or three of them. The carpet was extremely dirty with burnt mark and foul smell. The bed was not comfortable. It is definitely not a deluxe hotel. This is not a home away from home.
Room was clean, staff was friendly. Just an average hotel for a low price. They have a limited breakfast (apples, oranges, granola bars, muffins, oatmeal). Our room was clean and spacious. I liked that the windows opened. The internet was a little slow, streaming videos was a little difficult. Overall, a clean, convenient, cheap room.
Just a few of the examples of how terrible: fire alarm went off and hotel needed to be evacuated. When asked what the problem was, the staff said someone turned up the thermostat in the hallway to 90-degrees (serious!! this set off the fire alarm). Workout room had a TV that wasnt working, no towels available - in fact the container that was suppose to hold clean towels and deposit used towels was being used as a trash can! There were also nothing to wipe down the exercise equipment when you were done (gross). We are disheartened to read your review. Please accept our sincere apology for the problems you encountered. You deserved a comfortable and stress-free stay, and we did not live up to your expectations. We will personally address these issues with the appropriate teams to ensure happy guests is our number one priority. We truly regret the inconvenience caused and please consider us again so that we can restore your faith in our hotel and provide you with the hospitality you should always expect from us.Sincerely,Hotel Management
This is the most unprofessional extended stay property. It is very old and outdated. The associates are not well trained, and there never seems to be a manager on duty available. The check in process takes forever, the front desk staff was not trained properly on online reservation codes. The rooms smelled terrible. Do not fall in the lowest rate possible trap. Even with a low rate, you don't get what you pay for. AVOIDI received a copy of your review, and wanted to take a moment to personally respond. Please accept our most sincere apologies for all the problems you encountered during your stay. Your comments were reviewed by the staff, and we will holding daily team meetings to make sure your experience is not repeated. We continually work to improve our hotel, so I really appreciate you providing us with your feedback. If you have any additional feedback, please reach out to me at dmcextendedstay.com. We do hope you will choose to stay with us again so we can have the opportunity to provide you with a better experience.
They have great attitude are very nice. very friendly towards people . inexpensive . great for medical trips, business trips , couples vacation, family vacations . they make u feel apart of something. they have excellent service.

Our goal at Extended Stay Hotels is that every guests will experiece a home away from home environment. Thank you again for your review. We look forward to seeing you again, should your travels bring you back to our area.
The staff was very friendly and outgoing. I would like to give special thanks to Mr. Robert Luera, Antionette and Verna. These people made my stay very special. Truly a very enjoyable time in the best Texas Hospitality Tradition. The room and all other facilities were very clean, and I would definitly stay here again!Hi Michael, I want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. I'm so pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay and the staff showed our Texas Hospitality. Thank you again for sharing your experience with us. We would love to see you again, should your travels bring you back to our area.
From the time we pulled into the parking lot, then we went in and the smell was horrible. went to the room, the hallways smelled of smoke. and the room was ok. no wash cloths and no sheets or blankets for the pull out bed..The stay was no pleasant at all.Please accept our sincere apologies for the problems you encountered. You deserved a comfortable and stress-free stay, and we did not live up to your expectations. We assure you that what you experienced is not acceptable, and we will take immediate action to identify why we failed, so we can prevent these issues from occurring again. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused, and please give us another opportunity to serve you better in the future. Sincerely,General Manager
Frankly, don't know where to begin. We were greeted with a smile. The hotel was spotless and so was our room. We didn't expect to have a kitchenette, but we did. Lighting was wonderful(plenty of lamps), plenty of pillows, (not just two), surprisingly the room had an alarm clock with a night light that stayed on which made it easy to get up during the nite and not stumble. Excellent TV picture. There was only one minor thing and this was the shower drain was not draining well, but the people before us may have not reported it. So I told the front desk about the drain. We would definitely stay there again. BTW, coffee is excellent, strong and bold. Good ol' Texas!I want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. We appreciate you letting us know about the issue with your bathtub. We are sorry for this issue, but are happy to read that we provided you with facilities and service that exceeded your expectations. We are pleased to hear that you found our hotel to be clean and that the full kitchen was a convenience. The staff and I would like to thank you again for posting your review. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!
I stayed at this hotel in October for 2 nights and it is run down, there wasn't even a glass in the room, nothing in the kitchen, carpet dirty, tub dirty and the room smelled. The second night I stayed there I went out the next morning to get into my truck and my tailgate had been stolen. I was a single woman traveling alone and felt very unsafe staying here. When I went down to the front desk to report it and check out there was only a maid working the front desk and it took 30 minutes to find someone that could help me. I filed a police report and after several tries I finally got to speak to a manager, that did no good as he just lied to me and finally the insurance company called and said they weren't paying for the tailgate. A hard lesson learned! Please, please do not stay at this hotel you are not safe, I'm just thankful I didn't walk up on them in the process of the burglar.

Last week I had the distinct pleasure of staying a couple of nights at this superb hotel for Family weekend visit. My stay was absolutely perfect. From the kind, courteous, and professional staff, comfortable rooms and common areas, the exercise facility, and the breakfast buffet my experience was nothing less than exceptional.
Remodeling going on and carpet covered in plastic that sounds like bubble wrap when you walk on it. Complaining Heck no, it's fun. Room is clean, roomy and check -in was super fast by a friendly older gentleman. Security walking the parking lot as we came in. Very pleasedThank you for your kind review and I am glad you enjoyed our suites. I hope we see you again soon.
We stayed at this hotel during a huge cheerleading competition. When we got back into our room after a day of being done for 12 hours we found our room had not been made. I attempted to call the front desk several times but no one had answered. I sent my daughter down to ask for towels since our room was not made. My daughter then called me and said they have no towels. I told her to go back to the front desk and put me on the phone since their phones are still busy. The front desk told me that they don't make up the rooms on the weekends, which is not what was advertised on the tent card in my room, and that the hotel was completely out of towels. I told her I have 4 people in here that need to shower when will towels be available. She stated at 9 the next day when housekeep is in. I told her we need to shower then she FINALLY offered hand towels. Needless to say I have never been to a hotel where they don't clean my room and ran out of towels!! I will never ever stay here again!
I had the suite on the 2nd floor. Every time some one walked on the third floor suite the entire room sounded like a stampede. My girls cried until the people went to sleep. The floor boards need to be redone. The staff were top class and very accommodating for us. I would stay there again but I would need to make sure I bring fabreeze and even more disinfectant spray.Please fix the leak in the ice room.My daughter liked the flower pictures on the guestroom walls.Dear 746tabithal,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central.

Carpets/rooms are too perfumed/scented for me. Not good for some with sensitivities to scents such as myself and for use of my CPAP machine for sleep apnea since the scent gets absorbed into my machne filters. Please consider getting a fragrence free deoderizer for carpets/rooms or at least a very lightly scented one. The overpowering scents also made me nauseated from time to time. Breakfast had a fairly good assortment, but could use a change in the egg product. The eggs taste too much like a reconstituted procseed egg product for me. The fresh toast sticks available at times were a great addition to breakfast. The front desk staff were exceptional and provided awesome friendly service. Shuttle personel also great and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying that has a family member at Medical City Hospital.Dear 721jeffreygu,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central.

This is one of the hotels our company uses for our Dallas airport stays, so we stay here about four times a month. I have mixed feelings. In general, I like the rooms a lot. They are clean and have fairly modern finishes. They have a good sized kitchenette with a large refrigerators, however, many of them are broken. Instead of fixing them, they have placed a lot of small fridges in the room as well, but not all, so if you need a fridge check to see if it works after checking into your room. Also, a lot of the rooms have Air conditioners that don't work properly, this is a big problem in Dallas in the summertime. On my last stay, two nights ago, I had one of theses rooms with a faulty A/C unit and broken fridge. The A/C seemed to work in the first hour, so I unpacked all my things and it was late in the evening, about 11pm. By the time I noticed it started to get very hot in the room it was too late to pack up all my things ( I had an extremely long work day and was exhausted ). I called the front desk and no one answered the first call even though I let it ring for awhile. I tried back and a very surly man answered like he was very bothered and annoyed. I told him the A/C wasn't working and also the fridge was broken. Silence. I could almost here the 'So, what do you want me to do about it' in his thoughts! After an awkward silence, he said to hold on. He then sent someone up to change my room which I declined because of the time and effort. That same night checking in, there was a different clerk who seemed um, medicated let's say, she was very harried and distracted and had trouble checking a two of us in, she couldn't seem to get her thoughts straight, it was pretty strange. I would hope they could get their staff to act in a more professional manner. I have to say their shuttle drivers are awesome, very prompt and friendly. Maybe they should put the shuttle drivers behind the front desk and make the front desk clerks the shuttle drivers Just an idea.
It was an awesome stay at this hotel. Very clean and comfortable. Spacious and staff very friendly. If I go back to Dallas I will be staying again.

The good: Rooms were spacious with ironing pad, 2 TVs etcKitchen was good with all the necessary amenitiesOk: Service - not much to talk good aboutAverage:Breakfast - too little options, no variety/variationNot many options to eat at nearby placesFaced wifi connectivity issues most of the timeNot much view form the roomThank you for your review and I am sorry that you did not have a great stay. We do have a new internet system, so there should be no future issues with connectivity.
I have always stayed in a other hotel when visiting Dallas, but they didn't have availability this time for two days. i ended up staying here for half my visit and then moving to my regular hotel. After two days of living here, I could have stayed on. I loved the location, there is a Starbucks and CVS at a walkable distance - just across from the hotel. The rooms are clean, and big sized. It's structured like a suite, so you get some living room space too. The kitchen is well equipped. It's well connected, they have a complimentary wi if service and the internet speed is good. The only downside being that the area is not considered very safe, but I didn't encounter any issues.The breakfast is very average, No in-house restaurant. I don't like their wash rooms, very small and the products are very very average - I would recommend to carry your own shampoo, body wash etc along. The staff is friendly and helpful.Thank you for your review and I am glad you enjoyed our spacious rooms. I did want to let you know that we do offer full service in house dining in our restaurant, lounge and room service. Thank you again and I hope you will stay with us the next time you are in Dallas.

We enjoyed our stay very much. Our only complaint is that the night manager seemed a little hostile. Our room was right above the hotel office and she sent the security guard to give us a hard time if my 5 year old daughter and my 12 year old niece made too much noise for her. The security guard was always polite and apologetic and seemed to understand that she was being unreasonable. All the other staff was extremely freindly and helpful, and the facility was niceDear Y5041VXdavidh,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. I am concerned with you comments with regard to our night staff, and have addressed them with the team as well. Please know we take these kinds of comments seriously. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest!

My husband and I stayed 5 nights and were extremely pleased with all aspects of our stay. I had been a little apprehensive prior to arrival because the price was so good, I feared that the room might not be as nice as we wanted. However, we were thrilled with the appearance, cleanliness, service, and friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We would definitely choose this hotel again.Thank you for your kind review and I am glad to hear how much you enjoyed your stay. The Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central is perfect for long stays and I hope you will visit us again the next time you are in Dallas.
Great location, great rooms. Only problem is they don't inform you that they don't clean your room on the weekends without a request to do so. That means no clean towels or anything without a specific request to do so!
Carpets/rooms are too perfumed/scented for me. Not good for some with sensitivities to scents such as myself and for use of my CPAP machine for sleep apnea since the scent gets absorbed into my machne filters. Please consider getting a fragrence free deoderizer for carpets/rooms or at least a very lightly scented one. The overpowering scents also made me nauseated from time to time. Breakfast had a fairly good assortment, but could use a change in the egg product. The eggs taste too much like a reconstituted procseed egg product for me. The fresh toast sticks available at times were a great addition to breakfast. The front desk staff were exceptional and provided awesome friendly service. Shuttle personel also great and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying that has a family member at Medical City Hospital.Dear 721jeffreygu,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. I have shared your recommendation regarding air freshener with our staff. Given the number of guests we have from Medical City, I completely agree is it worth looking into. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
the room (suite) was outstanding for the price..BREAKFAST OUTSTANDING!!! The only problem the air condition was not cooling as should be if put on 75-76 Hard to find it especially if not been to Dallas in awhile

Stayed there for couple of nights, rooms clean, cleaning staff friendly, front desk hmm uh well they did their job... Nice pool nd jacuzzi. Ice machines, washing machines and sounded like a airbus 380 lifting off, outside security guy friendly and always there, but the internet damn that really sucks on the second floor.... Log in log out, no log, no login and so on. On sunday night the priest or referent shouted real loud from the small meeting room: And the Lord said.... Bless you all Etc etc. The place is not bad to stay, close to the highway, 13 miles from JFK museum, 25 min from DFW airport and close to CVS just incase you need earplugs.......Thank you for your review and I am sorry about the issue with the internet. We have just installed a new system, so we will pass this on to our internet company.
This hotel is currently under reconstruction and running business as usual at the same time. Upon entering the hotel many of the carpeted areas are covered in plastic and smell like glue, although there are numerous signs directing travelers to a legend vending machines, there are none and many of the ice machines don't work properly. This week I was in had a small kitchen area, and after running the sink to wash out a couple of glasses, I returned to find a flood on the kitchen floor, calling the front desk, a maintenance man was sent, went on to rebuild the drain pipe, so the water would drain properly.There are very few walking distance stores or restaurants that are open past 11 PM in this area. Next of the front desk is extremely limited store, more of an amenity featuring bottled water and strange flavors of Gatorade. After speaking to one of the desk clerks was directed across the parking lot to their supposedly much more plush Wyndham Hotel to see if they had vending machines, which also seemed to feature bottled water and unusual flavors of Gatorade. Not exactly high quality customer service. They do offer complimentary breakfast, however that ends abruptly at 9 AM, not exactly catering as many hotels run until 10 AM and accommodating the breakfast needs of a road weary traveler as I was. This place needs an upgrade in both customer service, hotel operations, and plumbing. The kitchen and living room areas as well as the bedroom do make for an okay stay, but the overall operations need a major overhaul. I think they're capable of it, they are just not quite there yet.Thank you for your review and I am sorry about the issues you encountered. I did want to let you know that we have a 24 hour a day gift shop attached to the front desk, which has a large selection of items.Thank you again and I hope we see you again soon.
Enjoyed our stay! Very friendly staff! The happy hour Monday thru Wednesday is very good! The rooms make you feel at home!Dear lonniem2016,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central.

Clean, quiet and close to all you could need. Not surrounded by the best neighborhood. Security could be better, too many people staying in rooms not authorized. Dear 630alannaw,Thank you for taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. I understand your comments, and would love to hear your thoughts on our security. Please feel free to contact me at the hotel. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
Has a great time. Nice secluded pool and room was quiet as requested. The kitchenette was well stocked and all utensils were clean and ready to go. Good location for freeway to galleria, Frisco, airport and shopping and restaurants at Addison. Friendly reception staff helped and breakfast was acceptable. We had a great visit. Thank you for taking time to write a review. We appreciate the kind words and hope to see you again.
Great location, great rooms. Only problem is they don't inform you that they don't clean your room on the weekends without a request to do so. That means no clean towels or anything without a specific request to do so!
This is one of the hotels our company uses for our Dallas airport stays, so we stay here about four times a month. I have mixed feelings. In general, I like the rooms a lot. They are clean and have fairly modern finishes. They have a good sized kitchenette with a large refrigerators, however, many of them are broken. Instead of fixing them, they have placed a lot of small fridges in the room as well, but not all, so if you need a fridge check to see if it works after checking into your room. Also, a lot of the rooms have Air conditioners that don't work properly, this is a big problem in Dallas in the summertime. On my last stay, two nights ago, I had one of theses rooms with a faulty A/C unit and broken fridge. The A/C seemed to work in the first hour, so I unpacked all my things and it was late in the evening, about 11pm. By the time I noticed it started to get very hot in the room it was too late to pack up all my things ( I had an extremely long work day and was exhausted ). I called the front desk and no one answered the first call even though I let it ring for awhile. I tried back and a very surly man answered like he was very bothered and annoyed. I told him the A/C wasn't working and also the fridge was broken. Silence. I could almost here the 'So, what do you want me to do about it' in his thoughts! After an awkward silence, he said to hold on. He then sent someone up to change my room which I declined because of the time and effort. That same night checking in, there was a different clerk who seemed um, medicated let's say, she was very harried and distracted and had trouble checking a two of us in, she couldn't seem to get her thoughts straight, it was pretty strange. I would hope they could get their staff to act in a more professional manner. I have to say their shuttle drivers are awesome, very prompt and friendly. Maybe they should put the shuttle drivers behind the front desk and make the front desk clerks the shuttle drivers Just an idea.
Will not return to this hotel. I have stayed here in the past and is has not been too bad. This time the quality has declined. Found a lot of bugs in room, outside of building is in sever disrepair, mirror in my room is not even hung on wall, but leaning against the wall on while.sitting on the dresser. Dresser is missing a drawer. TV is VERY out dated, and has very grainy picture. Beds look like they are from the 80's, walls covered in marks. Burn marks by light, light is almost falling off wall. Best item in the room is the A/C unit.Just stay away
My wife and I couldn't have been more pleased or treated any better. Beautiful Texas hill country, a quiet, restful ranch, lovely cabin with no frills but everything one could want (except TV and Wifi which we specifically didn't want!).

As the saying goes you get what you pay for, not. I was only going to be in town for one night, so I thought I would just get a room that would not hurt the check book. I was not looking for luxury just accommodations. I got there around 3:45pm and the room was not cleaned yet. I reall... More
This hotel is absolutely disgusting and is in violation of choice regulations. When we checked in there was excessive dried up pee and pubic hairs on our toilet.

This is a great hotel to stay for business. It is quiet and comfortable. The rooms are very clean. For the business person this is the correct choice. I would suggest going elsewhere to eat, the cafe is very accommodating, the breakfast is very fresh. I saw a lot of people liking what they found on the buffet.
A good place to stay while on business trip. It is located at very good location and having clean large rooms, courteous staff and good shuttle service. Good fitness center and swimming pool. I highly recommend this hotel.
The last time I came here was last summer, mid-August. Hottest time of year and YES, the entire lobby was without AC. Even the next am it was worse. So unbearable we skipped breakfast and rushed out. We asked for a quiet room and they put us on the second floor where workmen were walking around the platform outside our... More
This hotel has a style to it and I like that aspect given the sameness of so many places. The rooms are fairly narrow and laid out like a loft space which won't agree with many business travelers expectations. The location is OK but anyone who lives or travels here knows the freeway miles will be logged in the Big... More
NYLO was such a fun experience. The entire place feels like you are in NYC. The rooms are clean, modern, and resemble a loft. NYLO is tucked quietly away within a short distance from the shops at legacy and tons of restaurants. When I'm in the area again I will be staying here. Super friendly staff as well.
Normally we don't stay places for NYE, but this year we wanted to do something a little different. Very nice hotel and WONDERFUL and courteous staff that greet you as soon as you walk in. Check in was a breeze, as was Check out. For this particular event it was for the hotel guests only so we received bracelets to... More
I enjoyed my stay. Quiet so i could sleep during the day after a long nights work. Friendly staff and clean. Near food and sopping lotsof parking and tesla charging stations. Non smoking so that was a big plus. The down side is it fost extra to have a refrigerator in your room. Towels were a bit rough
After staying at the worst hotel I had ever been to (TownPlace Suites) last night, I hopped on the internet this morning and booked a room at Nylo. It is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous rooms.

Aloft in Downtown Dallas is affordable, and the decor is hip modern (and slightly cheesy, but refreshing and beautiful in contrast to the souless reds, beiges and florals of most chain hotels). The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom is stocked with Bliss products. We ate at the bar on our second stay because it was kind of late and we were driving a Penske ... I'd find somewhere else to eat next time. It wasn't gross, it just tasted like it came out of a freezer. Overall I'm fond of this place and wish Aloft would replace the Days and Holiday Inns of the world.

We stayed overnight during a remodel of our house. My daughter calls this Westin the American Girl hotel because there is a sky bridge that takes you right to the store. Upon check-in the ladies at the front desk chatted with us a bit and later that evening delivered the sweetest package addressed to my daughter. There were three brightly colored cake pops, some milk and this letter! I was so impressed with the thoughtfulness.Dear cstanush1, Thank you for staying with us at The Westin Houston, Memorial City and for sharing your review. We are pleased to know you your daughter had a wonderful stay with us and liked our warm hospitality. I hope we have the pleasure of hosting you again soon.Andrew GinterDirector of Operations
Excellent bargain for overnight stay within walking distance to the American Airlines Center where we saw Ed Sheeran. Really helps the overall experience and they include a shuttle to and from the concert.Thanks for the feedback!
I loved staying at HYATT. Our room was a delight, very comfortable and compact, good design ! Great to have a kitchen. It was very nice to have the option to cook when away from home. I felt that we were well taken care of and all our needs were met. I
Great value and location. Free Wi-Fi and breakfast. Rooms are clean and comfortable. A few blocks away from all the action of Uptown. Parking is in secured garage. No bar. Bar next door looks shady. But area is quite safe.
Ask for a top floor room. Was woken up multiple mornings by trucks on the street, then housekeeping vacuuming above me, and maintenance working in the hall outside my room all between 4a-9a. (I understand they can't control the street but the rest of that could have waited!) Don't expect a healthy dinner from h bar but the food is good and the breakfast buffet is very good. Pool and hot tub are nice. Wifi didn't let me connect on my 2nd day despite working both first and last day.Thank you for your feedback its much appreciated. We hope to see you in the future.
Good location and friendly staff. Be prepared to pay for parking (14). More of a motel quality and service than a hotel. Good breakfast offerings. Not good evening food offerings. Quiet and well maintained. Would stay here again.
Suite styled hotel. Used to be another brand every few years. Stayed in same hotel under a different name 5 years ago, but different name. Hotel has not changed.Breakfast was good, and staff has been very nice and pleasant. Free ber and wine for 1 hour from 530pm - 630pm. Nice light evening meal, but nothing spectacular.Hotel corridors in summer time were over 80, and room did not drop in temperature below 76. Called front desk to complain, and was sent to offsite hotel operator who told me she couldn't do anything.Pool looks dirty, but it just is in a bad need of a resurfacing. Pool is locked at 10pm. Shuttle will drop you off for dinner, but shuts down at 7pm, so you have to pay for a cab to return to the hotel. They have free parking, so if you're driving, this is a cheaper than the hotels downtown.For the amount of money that we spent, I would have much rather stayed at a nicer hotel.Thank you for taking time to let us know about your stay here at the Hyatt house. Yes about 4 years ago the hotel went from the Bradford Suites to a Hyatt. I do appoligize about the phone system, it was originally designed to have every room with its own number so when you dial 0 you get an outside operator, because the hotel was designed more as an extended stay property. We are in the process of upgrading the phone system so our guest will no longer have that issue. As far as the AC we have since gotten the hallway units replaced and I can say it feela so much better. Our rooms have a senor controled T Stat, trying to be more energy aware. I hope that the next time you are in Dallas you will come by and see the changes.Thank you again for the welcomed comments,Jeff JonesGeneral Manager
This place is older and probably could benefit from some updating, however I felt very comfortable here. I stayed a week for business but I have friends and family in Texas so I had a really nice visit as well. My parents stayed with me the first couple of nights and they enjoyed the bed while I slept on the couch which was not uncomfortable. My parents relaxed and enjoyed the room while I was at work and when I returned in the evening we would go have a nice dinner at nearby restaurants. The kitchen area was nice for making coffee in the morning and the refrigerator came in handy for breakfast items in the morning or leftovers from dinner the night before. I didn't feel well the 3rd day I was there and my parents had already left. I didn't want to go out for dinner so I headed down to check out the happy hour. They had wine and snacks and light meal options which was great! I chose some soup and crackers and went back to bed and felt better by morning. I liked the pool area but didn't get a chance to enjoy it. The gift shop had sandwiches and other drinks and snacks, my sandwich was very dry and I didn't like it that much but I'm sure a different choice would have made a difference. The parking is very old school with a big heavy gate on large springs that raise to allow you into the covered multilevel parking, which they do charge you for. Overall I liked this hotel. The room was nice, the bed and pillows were comfy, nice desk area for nightly paperwork, the toothpaste they provided came in handy since I ran out and the food and beverage was a nice treat!
the most expensive hostel available in the South - employees sloppy, unhelpful with a careless idea of customer service - restaurant and I use that term very loosely serves such wonderful taste treats as canned chili - the facility is dark and dingy and therefore shouts out dirtyCarol,Thank you for taking the time to write our review. We try our hardest to make sure each and every guest have enjoyable stays by any means necessary. Im sorry that we fell short in you case. We will try harder to please you on your next stay if given the chance. The next time you are in Dallas please contact me directly when making your reservation
Great hotel for the price. Breakfast and an evening social Monday to Thursday included. Booked on hotels website for 5 nights and payed for room including parking for 134 plus taxes a night. Stayed to be close to AA center which is about a 600 metre walk or the hotels shuttle will drop you off. Used the kitchen in room even baking some biscuits in the convection microwave :) Two very comfy queen beds and also a pull out sofa bed, as there was three of us we could have a bed each which was a nice surprise. We were there the week of Boston Bombings and West explosion so spent alot of time in hotel watching events unfold so on the downside I think this place is so much like a home away from home we probably didnt see as much of Dallas as we would have if the room wasnt so comfortable. Internet connection was BAD BAD BAD in room 422. Very nice touch to add the evening social of nibbles and beer and wine four nights a week. Glad we actually went and checked out in person (we usually dont) as the parking was added to our bill when it had been paid for with the room. All in all a pleasant experience.
Had a wonderful stay at this Hotel. Staff was very friendly. All facilities were clean. Rooms are beautifully furnished and very clean. I did not get to partake in the breakfast(I woke up late and had to rush out) but it looked great and I will try next time!Thank you for your stay and review. Hope to see you soon!
This is a very nice place to stay and good value and service. It is very close to the American Center. We walked to the concert. We felt very safe walking in the area. The room was very clean and the entire staff was so kind and friendly.
Very friendly staff and excellent breakfast served each morning. Enjoyed cooling down in the swimming pool which was conveniently located in a central courtyard with ornamental trees to help tame the TX sun!Thanks for the great feedback, We hope to see you in the future.
Excellent location and value for price. But lobby is a bit shabby, smelly, and beds lumpy and hammock-like. I expected more comfortable beds as I've stayed at other similar hotels like this and beds were definitely more comfortable. The hotel has a convenient shuttle to go to nearby places and the location is excellent.
Booked a double king two bedroom suite only to be placed in a king/full suite. Staff was not engaging and made excuses for things that were advertised on the hotels website but not offered. Won't be staying again.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While I wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of.Sincerely,Priscilla HargroveGeneral Manager
I went for a girls weekend to watch a football game and didn't know what to expect. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. We were impressed by the size of the rooms they were decently sized and having a mini kitchen really is useful. The complementary breakfast in the morning is a really big added bonus. It is within walking distance to everything and we definitely recommend this hotel.
We stayed here for the weekend and it was great. The hotel must have been recently upgraded, because it did not look old and ran down to me. The front desk clerk asked my son what floor he wanted to stay on, which is cool that she included him. He chose the top floor, which I always recommend. We stayed in a room facing Hardwood street, even with construction, it was still quiet.The breakfast was good and they had a pretty good variety.They have a parking garage, so you can protect your vehicle from the weather. I am not a fan of public pools, but this was clean and I did not hesitate to get in.The location is not the best, but it is very close to public transportation. I go to Dallas often and I will stay here again.
Room clean but......tv remote didn't work Tub stopper didn't work Security latch on door not secure, loose screws Sitting chair arm comes loose Door handle lock loose and comes open REAL easy, with the. slightest bump to handle, even though bolted!!! Quality control lacking at Quality Inn.

From making the reservation while traveling a rain-swept road long after dark until check out after breakfast the next morning, the personnel at the Palestine TX Hampton inn Suites went far beyond what my wife and I expected.

We had a death in the family and this Hotel was the only bright spot. The staff, especially Baily was the absolute best. The rooms are extremely clean and spacious. If I ever go back to Palestine I will stay here. I travel a lot and will try other Hampton's in the future.
This is a beautiful Hotel. The room/suite was very nice and the staff was very friendly. Lindsey, the serice desk Rep was very helpful and went the extra mile to make sure that our experience was unforgettable! Great personality. This will definitely be my choice of hospitality when ever I'm in town and any other place they are located!
I have stayed here several time and never been disappointed. I was meet last night with a very friendly staff not to mention hot cookies and coffee. The rooms are always very clean and comfortable. I will continue to stay here. Check process is a breeze too.
I really enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn! My family and I stayed for our son's regional powerlifting meet at Elkhart. The staff was friendly and the complimentary breakfast was awesome. Our room was clean as was all of the hotel. Definitely recommend staying here if you are needing a room in the area!
I have stayed many times at this hotel. It is always comfortable, immaculately clean, and customer service is wonderful. Check in and check out were a breeze. The room for breakfast is large and easily accommodates family or groups.
A nice young lady my the name of Lindsey did an excellent job for my family's traveling group at Thanksgiving day in arranging our rooms together closely as possible. Three rooms with 5 adults and 2 Grandkids. She was extremely professional and certainly is a credit to her Company. The rooms were extremely nice and comfortable. Breakfast had a nice... More
The drive was breathtaking and the room was large and roomy. I loved the shower! The bed was very comfy but the pillows were not firm, if that's a preference. Everyone was nice and friendly and the manager reception was a nice surprise!! I would highly recommend taking the trip to stay here.
Very clean and well maintained Hampton. Room was spacious and comfortable. Great workout room with complete weights. Breakfast service was very good. All the staff were friendly. Housekeeping did a great job everyday. The location is very convenient and easy to find.
My family commits to the Hampton in Palestine each and every year for our family reunion. The staff is Soooo amazing and soooo helpful. Cleanliness is top notch at this hotel. I can continue on and on, but so you know, the Hampton is definitely the hotel to stay at while in the Palestine area.
Nicest Hampton I've ever been in. Everyone was friendly and it was very clean. Checkout could have been a little easier and faster. The turn into the parking lot needs to be more visible as its a sharp turn once in the driveway and there's no warning (high grass leading up to the driveway).
During my business visit to Palestine, TX, stayed at Hampton Inn and Suits. Very comfortable beds, clean rooms, and the house keeping was trustworthy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and I will continue staying there for my trips to the town.
The accommodations where excellent and I will recommend that you stay at the Hampton Inn when in Palestine Texas. There is a nice breakfast daily, with a business bunch on every Wednesday. It is centrally located to the downtown areas.
Great place to stay very comfortable . All employees very friendly . Breakfast was great and everything was very neat and clean. Very easy to find and close to several restaurants. Would definitely recommend
Location of a planned second high school class reunion and we have already make arrangements for a third in succession, based on such complete satisfaction with accommodations, service and food quality.
I travel all over and not only get to compare multiple brands of hotels but multiple locations of the same brand. This hampton inn is certainly the best. Everything feels very new and modern. Regular rooms are very spacious. An added bonus is the staff have always been curteous, especially Amanda which adds to your stay. Location is perfectly situated near a grocery store with the best price on gasoline in town and near the local hospital on a main street without hearing any traffic. Don't look any further, this is your spot. -Shuang Li
Amanda and Lindsey were extremely helpful and calm during the power outage. Checkin and checkout were a breeze. My daughter left her clothes under the bed. They found them and returned to us. Very nice and pleasant. Enjoyed our stay!!!
I stayed at this property once more while visiting family. This visit was just as great as the last time. I stayed in my exact same room as the last stay, two years ago, and it was still in excellent condition. The staff was friendly and took the time to engage guests and chat a bit. The rate was more...

I went to Palestine for business, but only for one night. The friendliness of the front desk clerk made me feel immediately welcome and at home. My room was very spacious, comfortable and sparkling clean, I was able to settle in quickly and enjoy a very restful night. Located in the center of the South Loop commerce district this hotel...

Traveled to the Polar Express and stayed at this hotel that evening. The hotel first impression, I was extremely annoyed. After traveling from Houston to Palestine with 3 small children and a lot of luggage/stuff that comes with small children there were NO luggage carts anywhere, we even waited for one and someone else snagged it. All night only 1... More
Received awesome customer service. Arrived late in the evening and Amanda W. was warm and friendly. She took care of us and we were settled in quickly. Rooms were great and the hotel was very quiet. I commend Hilton for helping the flood victims.
The staff is very friendly and accommodating. One of the nicest Hamptons I have stayed in. Cant get over the size of the rooms... Great place to stay or should I say the best place to stay in Palestine...
I recently had to visit Palestine, TX for an oveer-night trip. I am used to the Hampton chain being nice but I was pleasantly surprised that in this smaller city I found a really nice luxury filled property. The location of the was perfect it was near everything food, shopping etc. I found the facility extremely clean, the rooms were... More
There 4 nights. One very cold morning there was no hot water. Had to have maintenance turn on the heat. Staff is very good. Excellent breakfast, free for certain Hilton Honors. I stay there often (business) and is usually a very good experience.Thank you for your feedback and glad to hear you enjoyed your stay. My sincere apologizes for the mishaps you encountered and glad to hear my staff quickly rectified the situation. I hope travels brings you in the area soon so we can welcome you back .
The hotel was very conveniently located for a business trip to Dallas and the staff was really accommodating. The rooms seemed to be recently remodeled and modern and the hotel restaurant had an outstanding breakfast.Dear Aaron R - Thank you for taking time to share your experience at Hilton Garden Inn Dallas Market Center. We're so glad that you were well satisfied with your accommodations, and we look forward to welcoming you again soon. We really appreciate your kind words, thanks again!
Most Hilton Garden Inns are relatively new, and the service is usually great. This hotel on Stemmons Freeway near downtown Dallas was not at all like the other HG Inns I've stayed at. It was an older, run-down looking hotel that didn't live up to the HG Inn brand. The staff was generally unfriendly and unhelpful. We had a serious maintenance issue with our card key access panel, that was never resolved by the maintenance staff, and the front desk seem uninterested in the problem, and never seemed attentive to our needs. I'll still stay at HG Inns...just not this one.
Very good hotel...close to the AA Center. Very helpful staff! Did not have any problems with this hotel. Room was very clean. Breakfast was delicious with many food choices to choose from. Easy to check in and easy to check out.Thank you for your review. Hope to welcome you back soon!
We stayed at this hotel back in October 2013 and enjoyed it very much.I wish the same could be said for this visit.The rates had climbed a bit for medical rates since our last visit ten months ago, but that's to be expected. What we hadn't expected was that the breakfast was no longer included with the room, and we had to pay 14 a person for it. It is too far for people with disabilities to walk anywhere else to eat, and the shuttle is unreliable at best, so we were stuck with eating breakfast there.The fans still don't work in the washrooms, which is very inconvenient, especially with my son having stomach issues every time we travel due to his health problems.The a/c was much too cold. When we turned it off, it would get too hot, since it's summer. You couldn't reach a balance.We had had issues the last time with waiting for hours for the shuttle to pick us up from the hospital. We had the same issue this time, and I ended up, once again, taking a taxi, so my son, who is very ill, wouldn't have to wait for hours after already having surgical appointments all day. I did talk to the front desk about it, and, to their credit, they comped us dinner, which was nice, and did improve the mood some.We will not be returning to Hilton Garden Inn, especially since five different amounts were coming out of my visa/debit account after returning home, and when calling to inquire about why this had occurred, I was told it was to factor in meals we had charged to the room, although I'm not sure why it would take five different credit/debits to establish that. There was still a discrepancy of 22 CAD that had nothing to do with the exchange rate, and that was not explained adequately to me. Not very satisfied.
Stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights on a business trip. Hotel staff extremely friendly and helpful. Location is perfect. Rooms spacious and well appointed. Indoor pool clean, excellent exercise room/equipment. Highly recommended.Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Dallas/Market Center. We take great pride in making everyone feel welcomed. We look forward to seeing you on your next trip to Dallas.
I have stayed at this hotel many times when visiting Dallas fro a trade fair and the hotel and staff continue to do a great job.The front desk is very helpful and attentive to your needs. the hotel lobby has been undergoing a renovation but you would never know it as the lobby is clean and disruptions kept to a minimum.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to fill out the Trip Advisor Survey. We greatly appreciate your response and I will share your comments with my staff. We hope to see you when your travels bring you back to Dallas.
Great Stay. Luke at the front desk was awesome. Great location in and off of the freeway. The hotel is exactly as the pictures that are posted. The pool was outside however, most Hilton Garden Inns have it in the inside. Overall great stay. Our room on the 8th floor had a spectacular view.Thank you so much for the outstanding review of your recent stay at Hilton Garden Inn Dallas/Market Center. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay and were pleased with the location and amenities, and our uniquely wonderful Luke! We appreciate your comments and look forward to welcoming you again.
Manger at desk was very rude at check in, don't think he was happy to be there. When arriving to my room it was very smokey but was a NON-SMOKING room, was offered another room which turned out to smell a lot better, but the man at the desk was rude yet again and made me feel i was an inconvenience to him. Would not recommend or return to this hotel again.Dear Valued Guest:I want to apologize for the inconvenience and service that you recieved during your most recent stay. Extraordinary service is our goal to provide to you and every guest of ours. At your earliest convenience, would you please contact me directly so we could discuss and resolve this situation for you. I look forward to hearing from you and having the chance to make this right. Best Regards,Blake DoranGeneral Manager
My husband and I stayed here while visiting our daughter who lives in Uptown. The hotel is a welcome surprise for being in a downtown location and the staff was wonderful. The lobby includes complementary coffee, fruit infused water, and a variety of sitting areas to relax while socializing or waiting for others. It has easy access off the Interstate with well lit parking areas and entrances. We plan on staying here many times in the future!
This is the largest Hilton Garden Inn I've ever stayed in, 8 floors. Not far from Love Field, so quite convenient. Hotel shuttle driver picked me up at the airport and was very nice and accommodating. Front desk checking in seemed a little inexperienced, but got the job done. Restaurant was very good, server was outstanding. Only a few of the TV channels are in HD, I was quite surprised they haven't upgraded to better reception. Upon checkout, front desk was incredibly helpful in assisting me to get an UBER ride. I'd stay here again just for the outstanding staff.We would like to thank you for your review we have recently hired new guest agents to our staff who are still in their training period but still I would like to apologize for the less than great experience. We would love to service you again.Thanks,
Housekeeping was my saving grace during my stay at this hotel. There is nothing like coming home to a clean room (603). This the hotel Southwest Airline selected for us and I think they did pretty well. The location wasn't all that great but we weren't there for pleasure this was a business training trip.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to fill out the Trip Advisor survey. I will be sharing your comments with my staff. We strive to make each guest enjoyable. We hope you will select our hotel when your travels bring you back to Dallas. Enjoy the upcoming holidays!
Everything from the room, to customer service was excellent. The Downside was just the breakfast items, they just were not up to par and took forever to get certain items. We didnt get a chance to hang out at the pool but were told bully other guests that it was amazing.Thank you for your kind review at the Hilton Garden Inn Dallas/Market Center. I'm pleased to hear your accommodations were to your liking and the staff made your stay enjoyable as we always strive to please each and every guest. We look forward to welcoming you back soon and hope you had safe travels back home!
Can't give a bad review or a good review as there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Being a diamond member there wasn't an upgrade offered, and my preference was to be far away from the elevator but was placed next to it. There was no noise however even though the hotel was full of Mary Kay ladies. Breakfast was crowded but services were fine, food was fresh. Room was clean but no special furniture or comforts and a bit old but nothing to complain about. I wasn't impressed or distressed... Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to us know about your stay. Our property is moving forward with additional renovations this year that I believe will give a bright and fresher look. We hope you will back soon to see our updates.
I stayed in Dallas few times before, but I have never experienced such a wonderful hospitality as in Hilton Garden Inn. All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good and fresh. I would definitely recommend this hotelDear Izabela S- How wonderful to read this! We try hard to create exceptional experiences so I'm thrilled that the team came through so well. Thank you for sharing and we hope to have you back soon.
I went to this hotel due to a business meeting and had some issues checking in. I was given the wrong room then had a couple of other issues but was quickly addressed. Still a bit of a disappointment having to go through all of that and not being greeted as an honors member after I mentioned I was. Room did seem like it had been updated some but shower still seemed outdated. Thank you for taking time to review Hilton Garden Inn Dallas/Market Center. I regret that we provided you with poor customer experienceit is the exact opposite of what we pride ourselves on. I do want you to know I have addressed this with my team as we value our Hilton Honors members and understand how important it is to offer exceptional service. I also apologize for the disappointment you had during your stay. I do hope you come back and give us another try and know that your comments has helped us improve on delivering great service.

I have stayed here many times on business travel and I have never been disappointed. Rooms are clean and staff is friendly. It is conveniently located to Dallas Market center as well as many other popular destinations.
When it comes to spending money on a good hotel, my dollar was not wasted one bit at this property. The hotel is conveniently located and staff is absolutely wonderful and work their hardest to cater to your needs. Customer service is definitely a main focal point of theirs. The rooms are spacious, have big screen TV's, and the beds are beyond comfortable! I literally fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone. I'll be staying here again.Thank you for taking the time lto let us know how your stay was. We're glad everything was a 'check'. We look forward to see you soon!Thys JonesGeneral Manager
I was placed in this hotel by the agency that hired me because the Hilton Anatole had no more govt rate rooms available. Now I am glad that they did . Its smaller and more managable than the Annatole which is HUGE. Room was pretty standard but did have microwave, refrigerator and coffee pot standard. Bathroom was on the large size. Cleanliness was not the best, but certainly not the worst. No Bed Bugs. Hotel business center is free! Yeah HGI. Also there is high speed internet in all the rooms. And you can send printing to the business center from your room. Highlight for me was the van service, especially when Reynaldo was driving. Because I am short and have a prosthetic leg I needed a stool to get into the very high 15 passenger van. He found one and every time he picked me up or took me across to the Annatole he had to run around and find it again. THEY SHOULD HAVE ONE PERMANENTLY IN THE VAN. My room was not ready when I arrived at 3:30 PM. The desk clerk offered me a snack from the little store. Or to have the van take me to a restaurant. She recommended several restaurants we settled on one. When Reynaldo and I were talking enroute, and he learned it was my first trip to Texas, he asked if I liked BBQ. He then took me into downtown Dallas to Sonny Bryans. It was great! The highlight of my whole trip as I never had another chance for a real meal again. On the way back to HGI, Reynaldo when he picked me up drove past the Book Depository Museum and pointed out Dealy Plaza and the grassy knoll. I never would have seen either were it not for him. Other employees were adequate in the restaurant etc. Other van drivers not so good--no stool etc. Desk employees were pretty efficient and well informed. The restaurant in the hotel in only open for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is full (eggs, bacon and sausage, pancakes, omlets cooked to order) or continental. There is a pretty complete buffet with hot and cold cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, fresh fruit, yoghurt, etc. Its pricey at 12 but free to government employees. Dinner menu is limited and there is a nightly special. Not on the menu, but available is a soup and salad combo for dinner at 7.95. It was exactly what I wanted. Room service is available.Dear Valued Guest:I want to thank you for your comments and feedback as this allows us to improve our products and servcies for you and all future guests of ours. I appreciate your business and loyalty to Hilton Hotels and truly value your feedback. We have purchased 2 new stools for the van so that we are proactive and have them available at all times. Thank you for recognizing our van driver for his services provided and he will be rewarded for his exceptional service. If there is anything I can do for you in the future, please let me know at anytime. Thank you again and have a wonderful holiday.Best Regards,Blake DoranGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Dallas Market Center
Just a one night stay but a good one. Room was clean, nice sized restroom, and price was good. Breakfast was tasty with a number of options. Staff was fantastic, morning and the evening prior. Good stay.
They quoted me 83/night the rate was above the per diem. The room was very old and outdated with a horrible air conditioning unit. The bathroom was also bad. The front desk was rude and not friendly.the only thing good about the hotel was the lobby. Breakfast was not included either. SmhFirst of all, thank you for taking the time to leave your comments regarding your recent stay with us. I'm sorry to hear that you did not have a positive experience. We always try to do everything that we can to ensure a positive stay, and I apologize that your expectations were not met.

i really enjoyed staying here. the food is exc staff is very efficent. rooms clean and very comfy. This hotel removes all stress from my trips out of town. I would love tolive here full time. Coffee is allways great in the lobby.
This place offers the average for what I expect in a hotel room. They are currently constructing a new ballroom and escavation and trash hauling noise kept me awake 2 nights. I also noticed allot of new construction on adjacent property.The room was the standard issue sort with institutional furnishings. Well used but in good repair. The bath was nice sized as well.When I spoke to the supervisor of housekeeping about the night time noise, she immediately comp'd me 2 nights making my stay a very sweet deal.They made me happy and I'll return.Thank you for your comments.
Rooms are clean, quiet and lots of space. Bed very comfortable. Very friendly staff. I have stayed here for Dallas Market and I am never disappointed. This was a quick stay to fly to NYC on a very early flight. Front desk took care of our transportation needs.Dear bronson291,Thank you for the great review! It was our pleasure to serve you and we look forward to your next visit.At Your Service,David Weston
My groups stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Market Center was Fabulous! Their staff was wonderful and exceeded all of our expectations. The service was outstanding! Next time we come to Dallas, we will definitelybe staying here again!Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your wonderful comments and we appreciate your business. We cannot wait to see you back in the future and if there is ever anything you need, please do not hesitate to ask at anytime. Thank you again and have a wonderful day.Best Regards,Blake DoranGeneral Manager
Stayed here one night - got a great rate on Expedia (around 50). Checked in before 1:00 because we were going to a Dallas Stars game at 2:00 and they were able to accomodate us. First room they gave us on the third floor reeked of smoke (despite not being a smoking room), so we called to inquire abotu switching rooms and without asking they upgraded us to a deluxe room which had a larger bed and a couch, which was very nice. The room was immaculate and very comfortable. One thing they might do to improve would be flat screen LCD televisions but other than that we had a great stay. They have a great business center, always have hot coffee in the lobby (its good too), and the staff is friendly. Location is also excellent for the AA Center, and many other downtown attractions. Would stay again.Dear Valued Guest:I want to thank you for your response and selecting our hotel for your visit. If there is ever anything we can be of service, please let us know at anytime. We look forward to seeing you in the future and thank you again.General Manager - Blake Doran
The hotel aesthetically appealing. The room was spacious and clean for the most part, except the tub was a little. The restaurant was good, all facilities and the internet access were excellent. The staff was friendly and there was plenty of parking lot space. The location was ideal for the business trip at hand. Thanks.
Nice enough building. Looks almost like an Embassy Suites inside. Free parking is great, but if want a bowl of oatmeal and cup of coffee for breakfast, it will cost you 15. My fault for not checking that. Had a maintenance problem in our bathroom that we mentioned when we checked out, and the desk clerk didn't seem to care much about it. Disappointing.Thank you for your review sorry to hear that your breakfast experience was what you expected. If you are ever back In town we would like to extend complementary breakfast to you. I also want to apologize for the issues you encountered and would love to be given another chance to service you.Thanks,
Checked in late Easter evening, and was treated great despite the late holiday hour. The hotel is in a good location, just a few minutes from Uptown and downtown, also continent to Lovefield airport. The lobby looks recently renovated. The gym was larger than average for comparable hotels, as well as the pool. The rooms are showing a minor amount of wear and tear but nothing more than cosmetic. Overall a good stay and I would recommend.
Looking for a good night rest after riding in a car for 4 hours which was simply okay. Housekeeping was great, Front desk just okay, but what was disturbing not having access to the handicap accessible entry. Finally on our 2 night stay, the door were blocked to stay open during the day. I made this hotel selection, because it was the closest to my niece's wedding venue.Dear Willie Mae L,Thank you for your honest review. We're sorry to hear that you weren't able to gain easy access to the hotel, and for the associated inconveniences. I do hope that the remedy made your stay more enjoyable. If there's anything that I can do, please feel free to contact me directly. Our goal is exceed our guests' expectations, each and every visit.
Stayed here for one night on our way home from Alabama. Have to say that even with renovation we enjoyed our stay. We reserved a 2 queen bedroom but none were available by the time we arrived so they upgraded us to a king with sofa bed and included breakfast. The sofa bed was actually quite comfortable, my teenage daughter didn't complain. All in all the room was very nice. Breakfast the next morning was very good. Breakfast buffet offered great selections also omelettes and waffles upon request.Stayed on our rewards points so the stay only cost me, 40.
The hotel is in a good area and I felt comfortable going in and out. The only negative on this trip was the lady at the front desk. I checked in about 10AM and had no reservations. She as very short with me and only stated what was necessary, she spoke very fast, did not make any eye contact and continued talking even when she turned away. I felt like I was inconveniencing her. I expected much more friendliness and hospitality from the front desk.I also tried to reserve a shuttle to the airport for the next morning, but she told me she did not have the papers to make the reservation and I should just do it the next morning. I did about 715, but was then told by the morning front desk crew that the shuttle was already booked until 1130.Breakfast buffet is good. Food and staff was not ready at start time, but were very friendly.Ensure you book hotel shuttle as early as you can.
This was my first time traveling to Dallas TX. I attended a five day conference at the Hilton Anatole and the location of the Hilton Garden Inn was very oonvienient being across the street and walkable. The staff was very friendly, helpful and extremely professional. The rooms were very clean and the bed was super comfortable. Thank you for making this a very enjoyable stay. Dear 554sharone,It was our pleasure to have you and I'm glad our team took such good care of your visit. The Hilton Anatole is a quick walk and works well for many so I'm glad you found it to be the case. Thank you for business we look forward to having you back again.Yours in Hospitality,David Weston
The hotel staff and hotel was great. The restaurant is only open for breakfast and dinner and the food was good. The staff was friendly and smiling all the time. I love the shuttle service. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.Dear Marilyn P- We appreciate your compliments. Thank you for taking the time to share and for your business. Please come see us again soon!
Very friendly staff - perhaps the nicest crew I've ever encountered at a hotel in this category (or maybe any category). Rooms were typical HGI. Only negative would be that I thought the breakfast was kinda pricey for the quality, if one didn't have a voucher. Otherwise a solid choice in the Design District near downtown.Dear FalconTx- Thank you for your review. Our team works hard to make great experiences so I'm thrilled you got to experience it. We appreciate your business!
Loved this property! Staff were friendly and knowledgeable of the area. Rooms were clean, breakfast was good and reasonably priced! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dallas. It's located right off I35 - easy access to all Dallas Metroplex area!
We were in Dallas for market at the World Trade Center. This hotel was on the shuttle route and was very convenient location for market and the city. Breakfast was great, the rooms spacious and the staff was very helpful and professional. Parking was safe and convenient.Dear Chuck J, thanks for the great review and for staying with us during Market. I'm glad we worked so well for you and hope to have you back for Market again.
We stayed here Feb 28 to Mar 6 in a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath condo. Our unit had more space and storage than most apartments. The condo was well equipped. The service was wonderful. Eveyone was friendly and helpful. I would rate the service alongside a Four Seasons property. Nice heated pool and hot tub. There is a well equipped... More
Spacious and nicely decorated rooms. The hotel was restored to its original late 1920s dcor. I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant menu which reminded me of the quality I would encounter in any downtown metropolitan restaurant. Definitely set photos of the entryway and bar. The meeting rooms are relatively small, yet have an executive feel to them which is... More
This is a genuine 4 star hotel with superior facilities and staff. If you are any where near Big Spring Texas stay at this hotel or at least tour the facility. Restaurant is excellent, great place for large meetings or weekend get away. Great exercise facili
We are part of Wyndham Rewards. We had no issues with this Wingate. It was easy to find with the Waze app. Free breakfast had a larger selection of choices. Nice size togo coffee cups. Super friendly lady behind the desk at checkout.
I stayed at Hotel on Texhoma back in July 2010 and had a great stay. The rooms are comfortable and cozy its an older hotel but its a great place to stay.

one of the worse hotels i could ever stay at. the room was not worth the money it had a rotten smell when u first entered looks like mold is going to develop into the room. it had stains on the carpets, ugly painting on the walls (needs to be remolded badly), also had cracked walls that need to replaced...

This inn is in the process of being redone. The front desk people were very nice and very accommodating. The room was clean and comfortable. parking is by the room door. Old television. No breakfast. Has microwave and fridge.
Everybody seems to have a story about this one motel they stayed in this one time when out of town on business this one time. WELL I HAVE MINE and i am going to share it with you.

Had to come to Forney for a week for some work and made a reservation the super 8. When I arrived the gentleman in the lobby greeted me and got me my key in less than a minute. I asked for a room downstairs and close to parking so I can see my truck and they got me a room... More
We certainly enjoyed our stay at BW, and our time in Canyon. This is the first hotel in a long time with AC that actually blows cold air! Everyone was friendly, courteous and helpful.

I stayed here for a better price. The hotel seems very new and very clean. I love the room, the interior and it was at a better location. Breakfast was good - need more eggs. Everything else was superb! Staff was very nice, too.Thank you for your stay we hope to see you again
This is a pleasant family hotel. Although the weather was warm, the pool was closed, which was annoying. It's next to fast food places. It's right on the highway so it's a little noisy outside but the rooms are OK. You can see the lake across the highway but the rooms do not have lake views.
First off, Id like to say that the staff here was friendly and accommodating. But thats about the only positive with my experience.You generally know what youre getting with a Residence Inn. Thats why I stay at them frequently. I had never experienced anything like this one before. Inside the hotel its dated and dirty. Outside the hotel room its run down and pure ghetto.Many hotels are close to a freeway or interstate. This one is no exception. The difference: its like right there, right outside my window. It was very difficult to sleep at night due to the traffic. Moreover, sirens seemed to be going off constantly. Ive attached a photo to show how close the freeway really is, and you can see an emergency vehicle with its lights and sirens blaring.I tried to go outside for a walk yesterday. Bad idea! Cop cars everywhere and the neighborhood didnt seem very safe. Im not sure what a Residence Inn is doing in this area, anyway. Seems like it needs to be torn down and built somewhere completely different.The inside of the room and the whole property are incredibly dated and dirty. Here are a few examples.See attached photo of a TV in the bedroom. Its so smallbasically the size of an average computer monitor. I havent seen a TV that small in a hotel room since the 80s.Another attached photo is of the pillow case. Looks like theres either blood or pizza sauce on it. Im not sure which one, and I probably dont want to know.Another attached photo shows just one area (the vent by the kitchen) and how dusty/dirty it is.These are just a few examples. Overall, Im very disappointed and would never even consider staying here again. The worst part is, I traveled with some co-workers who are staying at a Homewood Suites down the road. Im a Marriott guy so I went out of my way to stay here. Their hotel ended up being MUCH nicer.Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience and our opportunity for improvement. I will address these areas with our team since these items should have been resolved prior to your arrival. I apologize for a less than expected guest experience.Our guest stay and experience is important to us so we will look at ways to improve our cleaning and inspection processes to that we do not cause disruption to our guest. Sincerely,Traci
This hotel is only a few minutes from Dallas love field. Very convenient to the airport and convenient to the highway. This suite was larger than expected and clean. The kitchen had everything I needed and more. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast is a nice bonus. Laurie at the front desk made me feel very welcome. I will stay here again. Dear Ginny,I appreciate you taking your time to share your enjoyable guest experience, thank you for being our guest!We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to Dallas.Have a wonderful week,Traci
This is a great choice for Love Field area. Residence Inns have wonderful amenities an excellent breakfast spread and evening service (on most weeknights). Staff at this property is excellent. Free (secure) parking. Very nice pool and hot tub. I look forward to visiting again.Dear Guest, We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay! Thank you for being our guest in April. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to Dallas. Have a wonderful day! Traci
I just want to say that I was tremendously impressed with the staff at this hotel. They bent over backwards to make sure that our stay was as comfortable as possible, and really went the extra mile to help myself and my family with everything we needed during our stay. The hotel itself was really nice as well. Would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone, and I will certainly be staying there anytime I go to Dallas.
We stayed with you from June 19 to June 24 we had a wonderful time at your hotel,your staff was wonderful starting with Valerie at the front desk and Silas at the front desk both went out of there way to help us with all our questions. Avrelia greeted us every morning with a smile and did a great job with breakfast which was terrific, then there was Jose the maintence man who went out of his way when the TV would not work. you should be proud of your lovely hotel and the people who work for the hotel,thanks Hank and Michelle you both made Mary and I feel at home looking forward to seeing everyone in January. We looked forward every night to getting into the pool and relaxing and enjoy the other people around the pool, very convenient to the hwy if you had to go anywhere. Glenn and Mary
Room 711- This was a two night stay for a training session and upon checking in I discovered the desk chair was all ripped up (plether- plastic leather) missing from 1/3 of the seat, living room chair was used as a cat scratching post, stained dirty drapes, carpet-not vacuumed, no hot water in the tiny stand-up curtained shower-four mins into the shower-lather on hair and soap all over- (got points for my unfortunate experience). One of the bedroom doors (2 BR suite) had nail heads sticking out (discovered them when placing my hand there). Knowing that it was spring break week, I would think the staff was ready for the crowd- room was not serviced on day 2 of the stay until much later in the afternoon. Going back to Hilton.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your guest experience. I was disappointed to hear that the experience was not to your satisfaction or our standards. I sincerely apologize that the issue was not corrected prior to your departure. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention so that we can improve the service we provide our guests.Sincerely,Traci
Hotel literally on route 35..translation. .hwy noise all night.Hotel location central to a lot of things.Hotel not maintained. Not clean. No reinvestment in hotel updates. Kitchen chairs all ripped up. Need replacing. Room furniture terrible , embarrassing shape. Afraid to sit in. Courtyard is embarrassing. Overall management does not care in running a clean , well maintained hotel. I am a lifetime gold Marriott member. Stay in 100 hotel nights per year. I checked out 3 days earlier and moved to Marriott courtyard. ..Dear Mr. Donnelly and family,Thank you for your time to share your guest experience. I am disappointed that we did not provide you and your family a satisfying stay. I will review the suite accommodations provided for you during your stay so that we can further improve on the accommodations and services we offer our guests.I apologize and thank you again for giving us the opportunity by sharing your feedback.Sincerely,Traci
While this particular Residence Inn has been here a while they have updated the site and it is very nice. Clean - well maintained - comfortable rooms - suprisingly quiet considering it is close to several main highways - easy access - nice lite dinners each eveningDear Guest,I appreciate you taking the time to share your experience. I am pleased that the accommodations were a nice suprise. Thank you for choosing Residence Inn. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and we hope to welcome you back in the future!Best regards,Traci
I am a huge Marriott fan. I always choose them when I can. This property sits right on the Stemmons freeway, which is quite noisy, all the time. I was able to get a room in the middle, so the noise was much less noise. The chair in my room (room 525) looked like a cat used it for a scratching post!! The room looks as if it had been updated recently. The bathrooms in this 2 room suite are quite small, and the exhaust fan in one sounds like a jet taxiing down the runway.They do provide free food in the evening, but it's gone by about 6:30, so don't be late! Breakfast is typical RI fare. I do wish Marriott would reevaluate the coffee choice for their properties. It's kind of bland in all locations that don't have a Starbucks.On a positive note, the staff was friendly, and the beds were very comfy!! Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your guest experience. I apologize that your recent stay was not satisfactory and appreciate your feedback. Youre a valued customer everything we do is aimed at providing you with an excellent hotel experience. Please be assured that we are taking immediate corrective steps to avoid such problems in the future. Once again, please accept my apology. We would like to regain your trust and we hope you will allow us an opportunity to provide you with an exceptional guest experience when your travels bring you back to this area. Traci
We had three rooms over several nights. They were all clean, well stocked and available.The only complaint we had was that it is on a one way street and forever having to go under a freeway twice to get going the right way into the hotel.Breakfast stopped at 9:30am, great if you are up by 9, but not so much if you aren't up till 10. There were several place to eat within a block.Also, while we only slept 4 hours a morning, the rooms are quiet even though the hotel is next to the expressway.Its 15 minutes to a half hour into downtown depending on time of day. Also a half hour to DFW.
It's pretty old and in a pretty bad area. It's convenient to UT Southwestern Medical Center. The free breakfast was nice and staff was great. The rooms were adequate. It seemed very tired though. You can tell they do their very best to keep up an older property but if you're picky, this probably isn't the place for you. Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate the comments regarding our team. Our hotel has undergone a renovation 2 years ago and we continually strive to make improvements all of the time. I hope you will choose our hotel again on your next trip to Dallas.
When my husband and I needed to come to Dallas for surgery for a rare spinal condition, we decided to stay at a Residence Inn. My problem had begun right after we sold our home and we had been staying in a wonderful Residence Inn in Holtsville NY for over 3 months and loved it! They even helped arrange our stay here in Dallas. We have not been disappointed! The staff is helpful and friendly beyond words! The first room they gave us, as we had asked for a top floor in a quiet corner, had bar stool seating, which in my condition, was a problem. I thought I'd be eating on a computer desk for our month's stay! But as soon as my husband just mentioned it at the desk, we were allowed to see a handicap accessible room which turned out to be perfect. The room is clean and user friendly. It has a small kitchen with a microwave and 2 burners and supplies. There are lots of amenities. It is very comfortable. There are lovely complimentary breakfasts each morning with a wonderful variety as well as complimentary dinners 4 nights a week! The dining area is bright and cheerful. There is a lovely sitting area with a couch and armchairs and fireplace. The property is well kept with a beautiful pool area with a hot whirlpool and barbecue. The location is wonderful and once we learned the area, we found we are close to all sorts of stores and markets as well as Target, Walmart and Whole Foods. However you need a car to reach them. There is free Internet access and a downstairs computer if you do not have your own. There is also an exercise room that I regretfully can not take advantage of! However the most wonderful feature here is the staff...everyone of them! We will never be able to thank them enough for their kindness and helpfulness, whether it is with recommendations, directions or just being plain friendly. My husband and I have become big fans of Residence Inn! Both my children came to visit as well and loved it!Dear Guest,We are truly blessed to have you as part of our Residence Inn family. We are so pleased that your surgery went well and we hope you are continuing to improve every day!We hope to see you and your wonderful family in the future. Take care.
The rooms are very nicely decorate and cleaned, really enjoyed staying here. The full kitchen and living room area are comfortable and the beds with large closet are great. The bathroom needs to have its lights or whatever the timer things are called updated, but it's a good size. There is a gate to enter to park, but it's not for safety since once can easily go around it on either side if walking. Breakfast was very good, waffles with chocolate chips, yogurt, eggs and fruit. Definitely would stay here again. Be aware the shuttle does not run on weekends, although they were kind enough to help me out on my Saturday stay. Not too far from downtown and some great eats. Another thing, their work center is not at all suited for someone needing to check in with the office - old type of printer and you must stand at one computer stall. Not easy to use at all.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience while staying with us in Dallas! We appreciate your feedback and pleased your overall stay was enjoyable. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!Best regards,Traci
I stayed here for a weekend in September. The good- big room, best continental breakfast I've ever had at a hotel, very friendly staff. The gym also looked great. I was bummed because I picked the hotel for the free shuttle service. I even called and spoke with someone and they confirmed it was not too good to be true. Unfortunately, it is not offered on the weekends. This place would be perfect to stay during the week- free breakfast and dinner, a shuttle downtown, etc. First, we were put in a room that smelled moldy and then the toilet overflowed- which means the toilet must have been leaking for a while. They were polite about it and got us set up in a new room that smelled much better. We also booked a second room for a relative and hers was nice, too. Overall, I recommend it and I would stay here again. It's a good bargain- but as another reviewer said, you need a car.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your guest experience and feedback. I am pleased you had an overall good experience. I apologize that your stay did not start off on the right track but I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to correct it during your stay.I will share your feedback and the areas of opportunity with our team.Thank you for choosing to stay with us during your trip to Dallas and we hope we can welcome you back in the future.Sincerely,Traci
This was more than we expected for the weekend! Comfortable bed, clean and quiet room with friendly, attentive staff. Yes, it's not perfect...could be closer to places for eats and drinks, the TV in the master bedroom was ancient and small but we weren't in Dallas to watch television! Perfect location in proximity to Fair Park..will definitely stay again.
I booked a guest for this hotel in October and had a hotel confirmation number - didn't matter - when our guest showed up in January, they told him he had been bumped because another guest was extending their stay at a higher rate. Left our guest high and dry to find accommodations elsewhere last minute. Luckily the Doubletree hotel was willing to match the price for us! Never had this happen before - seems extremely unethical.I apologize but I'm not sure of the complete details so I have send you a separate message so that I can investigate the situation and address your concerns.From your description this is not our normal procedures. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and I apologize if this was the communication you recieved regarding a reservation. Thank you for your patience and I will follow up with you once you are able to respond to my separate message.
This was not a fancy hotel but as I said in the title, it was clean, quiet, comfortable, and safe. The breakfast was not fancy either but it was perfectly clean in the breakfast area and the food was good. I really love those Texas shaped waffles. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. The motel is right on Rt.... More
Before our travel we called ahead and was quoted a price of 371 for 2 people per room. When we got there the owners wife denied that and tried to overcharge us. She had a bad attitude with us then on. Also she made it clear that they would only be cleaning our room once a week since we had... More
We stayed here twice this month, on the to and back from Co. The bed an pillow were superb, clean, pet friendly, staff super friendly an helpful. Breakfast was good, a lot of variety of choices, not just basic.
This was a fantastic hotel! The beds were super comfy with the softest sheets! The towels were super absorbent and soft, too! Room was very quiet. Breakfast was good with Texas shaped waffles. I was very impressed!!
Stayed at this Inn about 10 years ago, It was fairly new back then..This trip it had changed hands to a Super 8.. Was in middle of some re-model I guess. The rates were sky high. Totally don't get that. Guess the oil boom/bust has struck again, however room rates have not yet reflected the bust yet.
My best friend and I try to go to Canton Trade Days in October of each year and we have found the Best western Plus Southpark Inn Suites to be our favorite hotel. Even though it is a 45 minute drive into Canton, we feel it is well worth the short trip to be able to spend the night... More
I have been staying at this hotel for over ten years now, each time that I visit Tyler which is about 12 to 18 nights per years. As always this hotel the building is clean, the breakfast is great, and the staff is nice and kind. If you want a clean room, a comfortable bed, good breakfast, and nice and... More
Soft comfortable beds ,clean rooms,and super friendly staff. Exercise room and nice pool to be enjoyed in your spare time. Breakfast is Eggs ,biskits ,sausage ,toast ,koloches and whole buncha more to eat. Internet super easy to get on.
Reservation was made in advance via the Best Western 1-800 number for a room that is both mobility accessible and pet friendly, and the e-mail I received confirmed that. When we arrived about 8:00 PM after driving all day, the desk clerk told me that all the handicap accessible rooms are not pet friendly and all the pet friendly rooms... More
I loved almost everything about this hotel from the staff down to the room. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly. The room was amazing and very clean. The only thing that wasn't so pleasant was the checkout time, it was 11:00 and extended check out wasn't an option. Other than that I will definitely return to this hotel next time I visit Dallas.Dear ELH2006,Thank you so much for choosing to stay with us and for your very positive words. We try to exceed the expectations of every guest and are so very glad we did so during your stay. We allow late check-out depending upon the occupancy the night before and the night of. If occupancy is high, we have a tight window of time to get the rooms cleaned to the level we require. Thank you again and we hope you return soon. Safe travels!
very friendly staff. in close range to many food and other vacationer needs. the pricing was very reasonable. very good continental breakfast. nice outdoor pool and sitting area although did take a while to get someone to clean.Thank you for you kind comments!We are glad that you chose to stay with us and we look forward to your return in the future. I am glad you enjoyed the breakfast buffet and our other hotel amenities. Please let us know if you need anything for your next visit.Safe Travels!Best Western Plus Staff
Our room was at ground floor after the laundry (we did not like it at all).It was clean but we had a group of neighbors mostly smoking cigarette and other Stuff outside our room(there was another small entrance close to our room at aisle which was nice for some smokers to be there all the time) we could even clearly smell marijuana inside our room. I asked from the receptionist(her) to change our room but she said Sorry, its during the spring break and we are fully booked. I really liked the design of their lobby and their restaurant.The breakfast was just okey, some of their personnel were really friendly and I can understand having bad neighbors at any hotel is not really the hotel fault, anyway we definitely never go back to this hotel again.Dear Guest,Thanks for your comments. I am glad you like the design of our lobby and restaurant. Im sorry that your otherwise pleasant stay here was marred by actions by other guests. I thank you that you realize that having bad neighbor is not Hotel Fault. We hope to see you again when you visit the area again.Sincerely,Hotel Manager
I love my stay the bed was comfy o the breakfast had great choices, the club behind them was fun and was a small crowd ,everything is close walmart down street Wadi called me by my last name in the hall made me fell like a queen i didnt think he would remember me all the people staying he just check me in thats it,It felt good to feel like home away from home and i got a great deal all weekend For 100 something on GrouponI am so glad you enjoyed your stay and that our staff was accommodating. I will be sure to let Wadi know about your comments!
I like the hotel. It's seems like the hotel was just newly renovated. The only thing that I did not like was that the hotel rooms were small. If your on a budget the hotel is great. The breakfast area was nice but the food was the same thing every morning could have changed it up a little. Hello Traveltime548,We are glad to hear you were pleased with the hotel and appreciate you noticing the extensive renovations! Our complimentary breakfast consists of hot egg dishes, hot breakfast meat, breakfast potatoes, hot oatmeal and toppings (raisins, brown sugar, sugar, butter, cinnamon), biscuits, bread, bagels, pastry assortment, a rotation between French toast waffles, warm maple syrup, fresh fruit, an assortment of cereals, whole mile 2 milk, two juice choices, coffee decaffeinated coffee, yogurt, plus a host of condiments. We provide such a large assortment in order that guests have a choice of selections. We are glad you selected the newly renovated full service Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel Conference Center and hope you elect to stay with us on your next visit to Dallas. Safe travels!
I had the chance to spend a week at this hotel. Very clean and quiet rooms.I recommend it. Very close to Dallas attractions and restaurants.Just one reminder: you can't take the breakfast to your room, which it's not a problem because the restaurant is nice and comfortable.Greetings Joel D, From all of the staff and management at the Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel and Conference Center, we appreciate your business and thank you for staying at our property. We are also glad to hear that you enjoyed our property location and our full hot breakfast buffet. Thank you again for the lovely review and please do not hesitate to reach out to me as I will personally make your next reservation for you.

Love the hotel, bed was very comfy, lots of pillows, room excellent. Breakfast was good, hot and lots of variety. The front desk staff (lady) was very good and attentive. Location very close were we need it to be. Check out very fast, good a good military discount. Will recommend.Greetings Griselle M,From all the staff and management at the Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel and Conference Center in Dallas we appreciate your business and are glad we could accommodate you during your stay in the Dallas area. Thank you again and please keep us in mind the next time you are in Dallas!Sincerely,Eric G - Director of Sales and Marketing
For the price and what you receive this is a great deal. I spent one night. Breakfast was awesome and staff was welcoming. The room was large and free wifi! I would definitely stay here again. Call or go to their website.Dear Julia A., We are so glad you so enjoyed your stay at the newly renovated full service Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel Conference Center! Pleased that you got to take advantage of some of the complimentary amenities such as full hotel breakfast and WIFI. Also so glad you encountered welcoming staff. Thank you for your stay and your positive review. Safe travels!
Here we are in Dallas! Think South Fork Ranch, Billy BOb's place all the Texas stuff you can recall from TV movies. Larger than Life, Dallas is Something. As a small town girl, I was SO Glad we were on a tour our driver was top notch! In Michigan we have two seasons, winter construction. Well In Texas they have one... Construction with weather breaks. But the Best Western PLUS Dallas Hotel lived up to its name. We were whisked up to our clean quiet room. Our King bed was well made, comfortable with Good pillows (sometimes we find the puffy rocks that give you a crick in the neck - not here) The room was clean all the amenities were there. We offloaded ourselves, tidied up in our room headed out to see Dallas Fort Worth to go to Billy Bob's. But more about that later.We found the two nights we stayed with the BW crew to be comfortable, positive experiences. We found the two breakfasts we ate there to be outstanding. If it wasn't on the Breakfast bar, you didn't need it. The breakfast room was kept clean the buffet well stocked. They worked! There were two other tour groups there when we were. We all descended on the food like locusts. But the staff was up to it. a dish began to look near empty zoom it was refilled with fresh hot replacements. The people who work in housekeeping deserve a shout out! They do a job to be proud of. Being on LBJ Freeway, it was pretty much easy on off... if you are a nascar driver. but then I already told you I'm a traffic coward, didn't IThank you so much for your very kind comments!!!I am glad you have a wonderful experience both here at the Best Western Plus and in Dallas. Come back and visit us next time you are in the area!Warm Wishes,John Bright HarrisAssistant General ManagerBest Western Plus Dallas Hotel Conference Center
Hotel is always clean and well kept. Staff are always friendly and willing to help. Beds are a little firm but I understand some like firmer beds. Would recommend for big groups and small private get a ways.Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your stay. It is great to hear that you found our team members to be friendly and helpful. We are pleased you found the hotel clean and well kept. We hope to see you again soon.
I have absolutely no complaints everything was clean and comfortable. The staff was more than accommodating and helpful. My stay made the business of apartment hunting less stressful knowing I would be returning to a a relaxing environment . I will gladly stay again!
Hotel in the average, nothing special but clean and very well located (10 min taxi to downtown/uptown). Is an essential hotel, located in a good position with a reasonable rate. Rooms dimensions are good, internet quite fast and with a good coverage in the building. Restaurant in the complex, parking free
Unfortunately, I had the displeasure of staying here for almost 3 months while completing a business assignment. Upon checking in the manager insisted that I had to call the corporate office of Best Western to obtain approval for my service dog to accompany me even...More
Very close to the State Fair of Texas. Hotel was clean and quiet. Bed was very hard, also the pillows. Fluffy towels. Flat screen TV with numerous channels. OK WIFI. Free newspaper. They have a breakfast offering, but we did not eat there. There is a great restaurant next to this hotel. (I don't think they are affiliated) 24 hours with excellent food.
We only stayed in the room long enough to get a good nights sleep. Lots of activities planned, and This Best Western proved to be convenient to all of them, Of course I planned that. Room Clean, Beds good, nice flufy towels, and very good...MoreThank you.
The motel was very convenient to our meeting place. It was also close to downtown so it made it easy to visit museums and historical places in the downtown area. The Royal China restaurant was an excellent place to eat which we would rate a 10 if it were possible to rate it in this survey.
The pictures on the internet don't do this place justice. The room was super clean, best bed I think I have ever had in a hotel and the pillow too! Nice breakfast buffet was provided. Employees were very helpful. My only concern is the ventilation system. It will not allow you to run the fan, it is on an automatic setting. I had to put it on heat and set the thermostat at 67 since it got so hot in there. If you are a light sleeper traffic might be a concern. It didn't really bother me. Nice little restaurant on the property.
I've stayed here twice in the past year. Once with a group and then recently, alone. It is clean and in a good area, with a non-Best Western restaurant on the property. The pool is small and in the parking lot, so I wouldn't go to this location for fun in the sun. But if you need a place that is easily accessible and clean and a good value, then I recommend this hotel.
Do not reccommend! Poor customer service the last two times I have stayed here. Bed and pillows are old and uncomfortable. Sheets do not fit the bed. Price in crease possible when you check in. Do not expaect great or experienced customer service...fail!
Checked in VERY LATE on a Friday night and we were assigned a smoking room with a king bed even though we did not request one. We were reassigned to a non-smoking room with two beds. Night clerk was very friendly and accommodating. Next day, we placed do not disturb sign on door as we had checked in really late. Approximately 11:00, we left room and went out to have lunch. Returned to room approximately 2:00 pm and discovered that room had not been cleaned. I called office and told them we needed our room cleaned and also informed the maid as she was in the room next door. The front desk clerk this time was very rude and told us that it was our fault since we had placed the sign on the door. When we returned to room at 10:00 pm, we found the room had not been touched. Night clerk said he could do nothing for s but did offer to bring us fresh towels. This hotel will NEVER get a single penny of my money again. The maids are inept and management is badly lacking.Thank you so much for taking the time to review our hotel, and thank you for your feedback. As the new manager of this property, I'm very interested in what our guests have to say. First, let me apologize for the confusion regarding the bed types service in the room you reserved. This is a training issues that I will definitely address with my front desk staff. We are working diligently to make improvements to our property, including retraining in every department. Our goal is a guest experience that creates loyalty.Please know that I am doing everything I can to make that a reality. And it's guests like you, that give honest and fair feedback, that make it possible. So thank you again, and we would love the opportunity to show you how we've improved. Hope to see you again soon!
The room had a definite mold smell coming from the HVAC unit. On our second (last) night, we did not use the AC because of the smell and the affect it had on our sleep. I'm using Best Western because I have accumulated points during my business travel but next time in Dallas we will try another location.
It was a terrible experience, could not take a shower, the bath tub was full of water, and the room smells. I complained to the manager on duty, i took three hours to fix the hot water and five hours to fix the bath tub
The hotel staff was very friendly helpful. Breakfast was nice. Hotel was located close to everything. I would definitely consider staying here again for future visit to Dallas. PL (Third Party Booking) booked me for a King Smoking room, I did not need that the Manager helped me switch to something more accommodating.
This is an older motel in the center of Dallas. It has had some updates, but could us a few more. The staff were pleasant and as accommodating as they were able to be, as they were fully booked. The beds were very comfortable, they had refrigerators and coffee makers in the rooms. Bathrooms were small, but updated. The only thing not updated were the a/c units, they were not central, but under the window units and were loud cutting on and off all night.
Very noisy location as it is right on the highway. Staff was clearly not interested in the guests, internet was patchy and the room smelled of smoke. The breakfast looked good until you tried the hot stuff which was awful. I would not recommend this for business travelers as you will not get any sleep, the highway right next to it was incredibly loud and they allow semis to park in the parking lot which made more incredibly loud noise. This went on all night until early morning.
I have stayed here multiple times. the rooms are always clean and staff is always friendly. they will go out of their way to help you out. the area is close to many dining options, both fast food and quite a few sit down places. (red lobster, olive garden, steak houses. )and more.Greetings Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.Your input, and the feedback from all of our guests is vitally important to us and we always want guest expectations to be met upon arrival.We hope to see you again in the future and you can reach us directly at (214) 353-8774 if I can be of any assistance.
The entrance from the road is difficult and even dangerous to negotiate. Coming from the south, the entrance is located too close to merging traffic. The room and especially the bed, however is very good.Greetings Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.Your input, and the feedback from all of our guests is vitally important to us and we always want guest expectations to be met upon arrival.We hope to see you again in the future and you can reach us directly at (214) 353-8774 if I can be of any assistance.
The overall hotel was clean. The staff was friendly. The breakfast was good. About a 7 minute drive to the Dallas Convention Center. Would recommend this hotel as a good place to stay. We will stay here again if in the area.Greetings Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.Your input, and the feedback from all of our guests is vitally important to us and we always want guest expectations to be met upon arrival.We hope to see you again in the future and you can reach us directly at (214) 353-8774 if I can be of any assistance.
Make sure to keep your 'do not disturb' sign on your door, and check the room thoroughly before you check out. As soon as housekeeper already went through your room, anything they find, they'll stash it away. You will not get your belongings back and housekeeping will lie about not seeing anything.
The staff was very courteous and the facility very clean. I would recommend it to friends and family and already have. It is very close to Love field which is a wonderful smaller airport. Thank you .The rooms were very clean and the staff very helpful.Greetings Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.Your input, and the feedback from all of our guests is vitally important to us and we always want guest expectations to be met upon arrival.We hope to see you again in the future and you can reach us directly at (214) 353-8774 if I can be of any assistance.
We stayed one night in order to be near Love Field for a morning flight. It took 20 minutes to get to the airport with traffic. The hotel is no frills but very clean. The room had everything one would need. The TV worked well. The shower pressure was good with hot water.

Staff had a uninterested attitude. Room and bathroom were dirty. Breakfast was frozen tacos or sausage biscuits that needed to be microwaved. This review needs two hundred characters. The review still needs a few more characters.Greetings Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.Your input, and the feedback from all of our guests is vitally important to us and we always want guest expectations to be met upon arrival.We hope to see you again in the future and you can reach us directly at (214) 353-8774 if I can be of any assistance.
If you can relate to the title then don't stay here. I will never go back to this hotel again. When we entered the hotel it smelled like a dirty wet mop. The alarm clock in the room was broken, and after informing the manager he did nothing about it. The breakfast was not vegetarian friendly, and the waffles were terrible (raw on the inside). The pillows looked like they we made for very small children, and on the second night the heater went our in the room.Greetings Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.Your input, and the feedback from all of our guests is vitally important to us and we always want guest expectations to be met upon arrival.We hope to see you again in the future and you can reach us directly at (214) 353-8774 if I can be of any assistance.
The location of this hotel is perfect. 15 minutes away from the city center and kind of off by itself in a corporate-like park while being VERY close to Love Field.The amenities will not wow you, but they have free breakfast, rooms are clean, and the place is affordable. Taking all those factors into consideration, this place was perfect for how we vacation.
The Eleven Inn is a quaint, older hotel in the small town of Balmorhea. It is owned by a lovely couple who multitask between greeting and checking in guests and working very hard in keeping the place looking good. The accommodations are humble and older but clean and functional. The best parts of the stay there, after a long drive,... More

Very clean walking distance to Market Square the River Walk. Has small restaurant with limited menu but works for breakfast or quick snack. Easy access on/off freeway with a short drive to the Pearl Brewery area for restaurants shopping.
This place was great, from the outside it looks like the old style hotels but the rooms have been remodeled and they did a great job, of all the places we stayed during our mini vacation, this by far was the nicest! the price was great, the only problem was trying to find places to eat. but it was quick to get to downtown. I would stay here again!
Th price was cheap but the whole area doesn't look safe or proper for a family. The room looks clean but it smells. The only person staff that I found was nice and polite. There are many mechanic shops in this area.
I and my husband stayed at Austin Motel for 2 nights for a weekend trip. Value- Room was simple and basic, small room but big enough for 2 people unless you are looking for luxury comfort. Plus if you are visiting Austin you wont be spending too much time in the room, so good value for a good night sleep.... More
Experience the weird side of Austin that makes it famous. This old motel was once known for prostitution and is now in the middle of one of the most hip areas to hang out day or night (I grew up in Austin so not sure the motel would like me saying this, but funny background none the less and not... More
Stayed here on business. Don't let the outside fool you, the room was nice and clean. The outside is not a good first impression. Everything here is very basic, nothing fancy. The outside definitely needs help. The staff was very nice and accommodating.
Location is Poor almost got hit two times trying to leave, 1st floor and room smelled musty. The internet was hard to login to and constantly dropping. The room refrigerator was not working. Carpet was dirty, smelled and had stains all over. Did not want my kids to touch anything. Food was nasty, I will Not stay at this location again.
Going to the Dallas/Arlington area This hotel is the perfect choice. The rooms are clean and quiet and the beds are just right. The location is perfect...less than 10 minutes from Dealey Plaza and less than 20 minutes to Arlington (home of the Rangers Cowboys). The hotel staff is the most pleasant and helpful of any the I have ever seen. You can't go wrong staying here!!
Hotel Staff are very friendly and the rooms cozy and clean. Beds are very comfortable and the price was well within reason. Location was perfect! Easy in and easy out as it was right off I-30 and Cockrell Hill Rd with a fuel/convenience store, bank, shopping and several fast food places and restaurants within a half mile radius. Also just Minutes from Downtown Dallas, The State Fair Grounds and West End.
The Location as in any Real Estate is so important, great location for our Bowling Tournament, also discovered a darn good location for a Texas Rangers ballgame. The staff and the Hotel were excellent, will be sure to keep this hotel in our TOP of the TOP list
No greeting at checking had to wait 15 min for someone to come out of the back room. Other times in the week no staff at front desk. Room smelled like mildew due to AC that had been leaking for a while. TV sound went out mid week and never came back and was never offered another room. Very poor customer service and isn't worth the money.
My husband and I stayed at the Hampton Inn on Cockrell Hill Road in Dallas for 5 nights in a King suite. Our room was very spacious, very clean, and very comfortable. If we have to go to Dallas again for future business, we will definitly stay here again.
A typical renovated Hampton Inn property. Carrying all the similar amenities and offerings of the chain. Property is convenient to downtown Dallas, but expect a commute time since I-30 is a very heavily traveled route into downtown. If your actually trying to get downtown - take the Commerce Street Exit and avoid as much of the mixmaster as possible.Staff was friendly, efficient and there always seemed to be someone cleaning. This property did not offer a complimentary shuttle service for the area attractions, which was a bit untypical for most of the properties we have stayed at of theirs.There are a few close restaurants/fast food choices, but don't expect a suburb metropolis of choices.
I was only suppose to stay one night, but I stayed Three nights. The rooms were clean and spacious the hotel was not only nice it was reasonable (especially being busy full due to the football game) The front desk staff morning night were the best (coolest staff I ever met.) breakfast was ok it's FREE, there's a lot of places to eat or shop at around the hotel. Oh yeah free parking! I would most defenly stay again!
Great hotel and staff - originally booked because of proximity to business conference but will definitely stay again next time in Dallas. Staff was professional and went out of their way to make sure my Wifi issue was resolved and that I was comfortable.
Nice hotel and convenient to our office on West Davis street. It is close to many restaurants and shopping and easy access to both DFW and Love Field. I would stay here again when making trips to our offices in Dallas.
Repeat guests at this property and we enjoyed another stay here. Had three rooms and were given snacks for HH membership, not sure why all Hamptons do not do this This hotel has only been open for 5 years and we had a good stay. The beds were so much more comfortable than the Hampton we stayed at in Oklahoma... More
We stayed one night - September 21, 2013 - and were greeted by Shiela when we checked in. She was very pleasant. Room was clean and bed was very comfortable. There are a few restaurants within walking distance including IHop and Sonic if you are looking for a quick meal. Just across the highway is a shopping center with a Walmart in case you need anything. There is also a shopping center on the same side of the highway with a Staples and a few other stores.
I had a great stay here. Staff was very friendly and always willing to help. No complaints at all. Hotel was very clean, no bugs, no dust, no trash anywhere in the lobby or room. The rooms were pretty decent and spacious with enough furniture to feel welcoming. Overall great experience and well worth it.
I have stayed at this hotel several time. My traveling companion stayed at another nearby hotel, but I chose to return to this Hampton Inn. Always, friendly, clean and safe! Will continue to stay here on future trips to this area.
Im a 36 year old single mom who travels very often with family. I Stayed here for weekend trip to visit friends in the area. Paid 89 a night for double beds. The staff was friendly and helpful. The Hotel and the rooms are clean and new. The free breakfast is always a plus when you have kids. Thy have a very nice outdoor pool and a warm hot tub. We will probably stay at this location every time we come to Dallas. There was also a Taco Bell, KFC, sonic, Chili's, Walmart and numerous stores and food chains on the exit that are also new to the area. I 100 recommend this Hanpton Inn. :)
Room was nice, renovations were horrific, front desk clerks not mean, but not too friendly either. Breakfast was the ABSOLUTE WORST I have EVER had at a hotel. Probably not gonna stay here again. The location of being near Wal-Mart and fast food joints helped a lot!
I enjoyed this hotel, I really did. We stayed here twice, once at the beginning of our trip and the second time, was at the end of our trip. There beds were comfortable, but a bit tall, for me anyway. The air-conditioning in our first room was a bit strange and we weren't able to turn it on properly. The bathroom was a good size and they had homemade chocolate chip cookies in the lobby. I later found out that this is done from 3PM Monday - Thursday. A channel that was listed on their channels offered list, came up blocked when I tried to watch it. I just assumed that the subscription hadn't been renewed yet. But, here were the hiccups I mentioned in the title. The second time we stayed here, we came to our room and realised that you couldnt lock the door. It only rested. So if we went out, someone without a key card could enter our room. So obviously, we switched rooms. Luckily, to right next door. When we came back from dinner, I noticed that the toilet had flooded the bathroom. It was because we flushed it. It was as bad as it sounds, it was only a millimetre of water, but we had to change rooms again. So, overall, I really enjoyed this hotel, and even though we had a few inconveniences I still give it a 4 out of 5, I would stay here again and I do recommend it.
Terrible stay. Hallway air did not work the 3days I stayed. Complained to staff several times and they did nothing about it. Phones in my room did not work my last night and there was a couple staying next door that was up late arguing...tv up loud and I was not able to contact the front desk due to the... More
Typical Hampton inn, good value, good location, but the room had a strong musty smell from the A/C and I could hear my neighbors more than usual. Check in was easy and prompt. Breakfast was a little space.
I've stayed at many hotels and Hyatt's but this one was a Great experience at this Hyatt! Amazing staff that was professional, helpful and a joy to talk to. Jasmine and Bianca were the BEST! Thank you for a relaxing stay.
Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel. Rooms and management are excellent. Convenient location just off the interstate with plenty of options to eat and shop. Rooms are always clean and well maintained as are the grounds, with ample parking close to rooms. Wouldn't stay anywhere else.
We spent a miserable night at the Best Western Executive Inn in Marshall, Texas, recently. There has been a lot of rain, but it still does not explain why the bathroom door would not shut without a battle! Obviously, when the carpet was replaced the carpenter did not check the door to see if it would close. It wouldn't. And... More
My fiance and I arrived at the Best Western and found out there was a mixup with the reservation made on Hotels.com. The staff were very friendly and worked diligently to resolve the problem. We stayed four nights and would recommend getting the room with the soaking tub in the living room. It was a great way to relax after... More
We pulled in for the night on a long trip. Bed was good! Towels a touch rough. The road noise was loud! We have a 'wind machine' on our phone, so we managed, but lots of trucks, lots of traffic. Would ask for the back side if we stayed here again. Very clean and very pleasant front desk.
Stayed there on business 2/16, extremely nice staff and the room was exceptionally quiet. Be sure and plan ahead and allow extra time due to the highway construction. This place is an absolute bear to find at night due to the construction.
Property needs some upgrades. It's basic but the location is excellent. Run by a hard working family. No extras. The rooms may be a bit old but they are kept very clean. We were there for 3 nights so they chose a corner back room to minimize noise for us. We enjoyed it, except for the very hard beds. Two... More
We stayed at this hotel for a trip to the boardwalk this hotel was a great value the rooms were clean and there were smoking rooms available. The only negative that I have is the coffee was not all that great
This place is very nice for the price, a great value!! The rooms were very clean!!! They have recently been renovated! Carpets baths and all very clean! Could use some newer pillows and bedspread, but other then that it was great!
I initially reserved a room, on my own, at the Knights Inn Market Center in Dallas, Texas. The booking was completely unprofessional, with errors in the booking info. This was corrected after a couple of emails. I then inquired of the cancellation policy. The explanation was first, and I quote, before 24 hours. After inquiring of the meaning of that statement, they modified it to after 24 hours!!! Complete and utter incompetence. This was in the month of January, and my reservation was in April. I then noted the charges for the room appear on my credit card statement in January!!!! I then realized the level of incompetence, and wondered if fraud may be involved. A phone call to the Inn put me in contact with a young lady, who couldn't even find a record of my reservation. She was eventually helpful in finding it and reversing the charge to my account. She also clarified verbally the cancellation policy, which was the standard prior to 24 hours before the date of the stay. After all this, I emailed about a week ago, asking them to cancel my reservation, and confirm by email. No response, so sent a second email asking again for confirmation. No response. I have again emailed, to the attention of the young lady who helped in the past, requesting confirmation of my cancellation. Ed WooleverHello Mr. Woolever, I apologize that you had some issues with your reservation. According to our records which were emailed to you upon your request, your reservation was booked for January 21st, since you failed to checkin on January 21st you were charged for the first night. When you called us to inform us about the charge and your intention to book the room on April 21st, we thought of it as a miscommunication and as a courtesy reversed the charges immediately. Later you emailed us with your intention to cancel the room for April 21st, I emailed you back requesting you to call me for the cancellation (as it is a standard protocol for most hotel reservation cancellation to get a verbal authorization), which you called and canceled within 10 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the initial date mismatch and the charge, I hope we can go pass that and you would give us an opportunity to show you our commitment to customer service by staying with us. If there is anything I can do to persuade you to change your decision please give us a call. Thank you for your feedback, your feedback is very valuable to us since it helps us improve our services.
I stayed at this hotel a month ago, and I got it on Hotels.com with a coupon. When I arrived, the night clerk was not too friendly, but was fast in completing the check-in process. The room was on the ground level, and had some noisy people walking past it throughout the night. On the good side, the bed and pillows were clean and comfortable, and the were plenty of lightning options in the room. I got a good night's rest. It also had a flat-screen TV, but I didn't watch it, so I can't comment on whether it worked or not. On the bad side, the shower did not have any hot water, and the sink faucet did not produce any water at all. So I had to take a cold shower and had to wash my hands, brush my teeth, etc. by turning on the water faucet in the bathtub and washing in my hands and moistening my toothbrush in the resulting flow of water. There were also none of the freebies you expect at a hotel, like toothpaste. Another downfall was that hard to step in and out of because the outer wall was high. I almost slipped when I got out of the shower.The morning clerk was friendly and completed the check-out process quickly. Overall, I would only stay here for a night at most. And ask for a room with running water in the sink and hot water in the shower.
We stayed a night to catch an early flight out of Love Field.I was a little skeptical about the part of town it's in,I know the surrounding area ,it's a little shady..Turns out the motel is located in a business area where nobody is around after business hours.Not bad at all.If you are a whiner about paying for a low end room and not getting a five star hotel this place is not for you.It's clean,quiet and fairly well maintained,well worth the cost.I will stay again now that I know about the place since it's less than five minuets from DAL.
If I could give this hotel zero stars, that's what I would do. I thought it was really that lousy. There is no breakfast service, the wi-fi is very slow and undependable, and these clowns gave me a hotel room where the phone did not work. They should just tear down this ghetto hotel and make sure all of their workers are out of a job. They should've given me another room, but no. I am NEVER staying here again.

First impression was positive. However in 5 minutes I discovered that Wi-Fi doesn't work in the room. I asked a manager, she promised to repair it on the next day. I spend three nights in the hotel and nothing was changed with Wi-Fi. I had to work in garden (Wi-Fi worked outside), sometimes under grass sprinkles. Morning coffee finishes by 10 am. Living cockroaches in the room and dead in the bad. Afro-Americans knock to the door and ask for gasoline for their car because of pregnant wife. One positive point - 55 for a night, however I recommend to demolish it.
This is the second time we have stayed at this property. The staff is so friendly, they're remodeling the rooms and our room this time around was great with fresh carpet, new tv, fridge and micro. It is not super fancy and doesn't have frills but its incredibly nice and clean for the price. There's is no breakfast for free but you can pay 3.75 for a nice little cereal/juice/fruit meal. Add that to the price of this hotel and you're still not even close to the price of a fancy hotel. We stay here for medical reasons at UT Southwestern St Paul, so if you're looking for that reason, it's very close, just a 3 min drive up Harry Hines, no interstate driving required! I highly recommend this property!! It won't let me unclick terrible for my swimming pool vote but there's no pool, so there's no opinion on that :)
Stayed there last night while visiting in Dallas and it was very clean and economical. Has a small fridge in the room but no microwave or coffee pot. A bit off the beaten track and it filled quickly and the staff were very friendly too.
Room need to be update shower was very dirty and also had water leaking I called the front desk and told them my issue no one came to look at it . sheets and blankets need to be replace. House keeping people are rude and don't know how to knock on doors
They lost my resveration, I gave them a copy and they still took half an hour to find it. When they did find it, they said they already sold my room because of the late check-in I PAYED BY CREDIT CARD ON LINE! I reserved it at 5pm and showed up at 7pm!!! Then they said they could sell me a room that cost more... it took me another 15 minutes to get them to give me a simular room. simple right... 2 beds smoking guess they don't get it. When I got home I found out that not only did I pay for it on-line, I also payed for it twice with them. The ONLY thing this place has going for it is that it is clean, but pay in cash or over pay!Hello Ms. Sara,We apologize for all the trouble you faced at our hotel. We looked into your matter, it seems the confusion was created because of our new hire. After reading your review we are going to put more effort in training our new employees so that our guest don't go through the same trouble you did.Thank you for appreciating our clean rooms. We hope to see you again, so that you would experience ease of checkin that your deserved.Sincerely,Veronica
The place is in an absolutely secluded area, made me extremely nervous to leave my vehicle in such a place.The rooms..... Absolutely disgusting, there was a roach crawling on the bathroom floor. Mirrors were disgusting as well.I would dodge this hotel like roaches dodge light.
Flew in and asked the cab driver for a decent motel. We ended up here. The front building where we stayed was updated and very nice. The owners were very nice. They were making many improvements outside during our stay. The area was not the best and shopping was far. The bus did stop in front of the motel and it was a short ride to the train. If your passing through I would give them a try. Hello Cori, thank you for your feedback. We really appreciate your kind words and we will continue making improvements to our hotel to enhance our guest experience. Come back and see us soon!
I often travel to Dallas for bussiness and always stay Knights Inn Market Center. The hotel is close to highways and close to Love Field and many restaurants. The rooms are always clean and the hotel staff Is very friendly. The front desk staff are always willing to assist you with anything you need.
I have stayed at a lot of budget friendly places in many states and this was one of the best. The staff were friendly, the room was clean, it had a microwave and fridge which was awesome. The location was perfect and very quiet I wasn't worried about my safety or my cars! I have never been to Dallas before but it seemed like everything was very close and easy to find. If we ever go back to Dallas we will definitely be staying here!

My daughter and I had business to conduct an I was on a budget. It was close to Southwestern Medical Center. TV was good. Bathroom light fixture was tempermental. Room had zero privacy to dress. All in all, we got what we paid for and that's really all you can ask. Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to review. We are delighted to hear that your stay was satisfactory in terms of getting great value for the low budget. Each year we continue to make our guestrooms better and comfortable for our guest. I hope you decide to choose us again on your next visit so that we can make your stay great!
The Knights Inn Motel is a newly remodeled property both inside and out. My room was very clean and the carpet and drapery looked a day old. Very quiet surroundings with pleasant desk clerk (Keelee) made my stay a very positive experience!
clean good value location is good rooms large and clean some noise between rooms late at nightThank you for your positive feedback. It seems like you weren't fully satisfied as there was some noise. Next time on your visit, please call the front desk so that we can take care of this issue right away! See you on your next visit!

This is an older motel, but it is well maintained. The desk had ample space for spreading out papers and the bed was comfortable and appeared to be new. It is a no-frills operation (no extra pillows, fridge, pool, or breakfast) and the management is not as friendly as they could be, but they provide an excellent handout that explains the free wifi, heating and AC, TV, etc, with a map showing the nearby restaurants on the reverse side. I wish more hotels communicated such information this efficiently. The price was excellent, particularly for this area of Dallas.Thank you WiseTraveler, for sharing your experience with us. It really makes us happy when our guests tell us about what they liked and what improvements they would like for us to make. Though we do not have microwave and fridge in all our rooms, we do have in some which you can request on your next stay. We strive to give great service and value to all our guests, I apologize that you were disappointed about the management friendliness, I assure you we will keep making improvements. Thank you again for staying with us and for giving us your valuable input.

No breakfast, breakfast pastries in vending machine. Free coffee. Place needs some minor repairs. Quiet, bed comfortable. No nearby restaurants so the vending machine is like the only option parking was adequate.

This could be the best value in the Dallas area. Overall, my stay was quite enjoyable, especially considering the central location and price: 45 (with tax) a night. The no-frills yellow and blue exterior of this motel is a little funny. However, inside the room was very clean and updated, with a few prominent recent additions such as leather-like chairs and matching black-and-brown desk and nightstands, which between them have five drawers and two shelfs for ample storage . The carpet, sink, curtains, furniture, and flat screen TV all appear to be relatively new. I suppose they had to watch costs somewhere, so that explains the thin, colorful bed spread, bath-fitter style plastic tub and shower, and a clothing rack oddly affixed to a wall right by the bathroom sink. The amenities of free wi-fi and excellent housekeeping are things I appreciated. The property is in an underdeveloped area defined by a non-teaching hospital and a golf course, so don't expect to do anything within walking distance. It's conveinently located near a major highway, about 6 miles from downtown Dallas and 5 miles from the Uptown Area/Arts District. There are a few fast-food places within a minutes drive. The area is quiet and safe. Won't you wont get in your room are a sink inside the bathroom (it's separate and outside the bathroom), a closet, a refrigerator, an iron, a blow dryer, coffee pot and coffee, luxurious towels, body wash, or big fluffly pillows. But at this price, can you really complain

I stayed here on a last minute stop from driving fatigue. The room was in decent shape. The building is old but the rooms are adequately updated. Fridge, microwave, hair dryer in room. decent sound dampening between rooms but you can hear outside conversations as if they were in your room. For the price (68 on a Monday evening) it... More
This hotel is conveniently located in Dallas next to a major freeway and you can get anywhere from here. Room was comfortable, and clean. We liked the suite and a nice layout. The street behind the hotel was a bit noisy but overall, it was a pleasant stay. Breakfast was served everyday and it was good, fresh, and some variety was offered.Hi,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel on Trip Advisor. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. I will share your feedback with our staff and we hope to see you again in the future.
We stayed here because there was a group on and I am a Mariott Rewards Elite member, AND I have stayed at MANY residence inn's across the US.This was a great location, right off the expressway and MINUTES away from most things in Dallas. We arrived and there was a little confusion on our room, but it was fixed, we were put into a one bedroom suite as we had reserved that had a door (we brought kids with us) and that fixed the problem, the night staff was very accommodating to our request.Breakfast was good, had a nice selection (basic eggs, sausage, OJ, Milk, Cereal, Waffles etc) ONE tip I could give the hotel is GET ANOTHER WAFFLE MAKER! Everyone LOVED the texas shaped waffles but had to wait forever to make one since there was just one of them! They also serve a dinner type meal M-Tu-Wed, which while we didn't get to try is a nice perk for business travelers watching their expense accounts.I read some other reviews and can say that while this isn't a 2014 newly built property it really is in great shape, wear and tear here and there but nothing that was really out of the ordinary from other hotels, there were no stains on the floors, no holes in walls, doors worked great, the noise outside the halls and outside were nothing bad and no weird smells!The pool was a little highly chlorinated and I think someone might have just not known how much to really put in, but it was a heated pool and the hot tub wasn't working at the time, but keep in mind that it was 40 degrees the day before and just into the mid 60's so I am sure it was just opening season.Also one tip I would say is bring your own pillows if you can, I did read on another review where someone said the pillows were small, yes they are and hard! The beds were comfortable but I would recommend the hotel upgrade and replace all those little tiny rocks (pillows).I think the front desk pulls double duty for housekeeping as a few requests that we requested never happened like an extra blanket and a few towels brought to our room but I could tell the front desk staff was working their hardest so I let it slide and just dealt with it. Over all we had a very nice stay, and this is a property I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay, centrally located and with a nice friendly staff.Thank you so much for the kind and generous words. We appreciate your high praise for our staff and hotel. We are always looking for ways to improve our offerings. Currently we are finishing our exterior updates, including new gardens. Please join us again soon, we are very family friendly. The concerns you provided have also been addressed. Thank you so much. Lynn Martin, General Manager
The staff was very outgoing and friendly. They made you feel welcomed. The location is convenient to the expressway if you are traveling around the Metroplex. There is shopping and restaurants nearby, within walking distance.That was a great review. Thanks so much. We want to know how our guests feel about their experiences. Please continue to let us know how we are doing. We are dedicated to ensuring your comfort. You are always welcome here.
The location was excellent for us as we were visiting a friend at a nearby hospital. Check-in was quick, it was very clean and well maintained and the staff was helpful. There is easy on-off of Central Expressway. A full kitchen is available stocked with dishes, pots, pans, etc. A nice touch was the microwave popcorn. Breakfast was good and as expected. Staff was available for help there too. Overall a good choice for an overnight stay. The price was reasonable.
I stayed here back in February. Didn't have the greatest stay. My comments can be found in a previous review. After all was said and done the first time, the GM sent me 2 free night vouchers to use at any Residence Inn in the country. That was all well and good and I thought I was done with my bad stay. But those vouchers came back to haunt me as I went to use them in St Louis and I was told that marriott had stopped using those 2 years ago and they were no good. How embarrassing! The people in St Louis were great. Very helpful with the situation. I'd recommend never staying here again. In the end they ending up paying for my night in St Louis and giving me some points. Doesn't make up for the embarrassing situation. I even called marriott corporate in regards to the situation. Thank you so much for taking time to help us to understand what happened to you. Please accept our apology as a team. The challenge you experienced in St Louis was handled beautifully by their staff and followed up by our Leadership as they paid for the room nights directly. We appreciate your loyalty to Marriott and look forward to a long and successful relationship.
Honestly, the size of the room was great. I had my fiance' and my two teen sons with me. My son's switched out the bedroom, because we were there two nights. While one was sleeping in the bedroom, the other slept on the couch. We had attempted to pull out the sleeper sofa, but decided against it because we found cookie crumbs and other items underneath the mattress. The couch itself didn't look that clean, so I bought new linen and he slept on it instead. There was the hassle of using the key card everywhere, but when it comes to safety, I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was also the issue of how our room was being paid, we secured the deposit with a credit card, but when we got there, we wanted to pay with cash. But everything was quickly cleared up with a phone call to the manager. Overall, our stay there was pleasant. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for taking time to share your experience with us. We consistently work to address the concerns our guests have shared. Please consider joining us again soon and allowing us the opportunity to meet and exceed your expectations. Have a great day. Lynn Martin, General Manager
Clean facility just off freeway ..... staff friendly and efficient .... good breakfast choices. We will stay here again for follow up visits with doctors at UT Northeast and recommend it for others requiring expected high standards from Hilton properties.
