Our family stayed here one night during our summer road trip. The location is great and easy to find since it is right off of I-90. The room was clean and the breakfast had enough choices to please all 3 of us. My only complaint is the noise level from a large group of teenagers. It appeared that it was... More
This was a nice clean room. The breakfast was adequate and a bowl of fruit was available in the lobby at all times. Danielle at the front desk provided great service. The only issue we had was our heat was hard to regulate in our 4th floor room.
I understand your policy is to charge a nights stay for a no show reservation. But I called the hotel directly to cancel our reservation. I spoke with a gentleman who assured me our reservation was cancelled. That was the end of April first of May. Now fast forward to the week of our supposed reservation. Our caller id shows... More
This is a very nice, clean and very friendly hotel. The entire staff is friendly is very helpful. Breakfast was fantastic with everything you could possibly want. The room was spotless, the pool was perfect. Great hotel, great stay, would stay again if I'm in the area.
Two blocks from I-90, next to McDonalds. I stayed Monday, 09-21-15, in room 207. Decent bed. Upgraded lobby, luggage cart, friendly overnight desk staff (Detz He was out of rooms for pets, but called other hotels for someone who walked in after I did). Breakfast includes cereal and toast, mini donuts, hot sausage links, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, and... More
Just a one night stay here. The room was okay and we had no complaints. This was just a stop over on our way to somewhere else. Bed was comfortable, room was quiet. Breakfast was the same as all other. Little more then continental when you add eggs and hot waffles.
Staff was nice. Facility was clean and generally well maintained. Convenient location to all the attractions. Room was okay but small and without frills. Breakfast was a little sparse. We felt that it was overpriced for the level of quality we were expecting. Would have been a good value if priced under 100 but we paid closer to 150 as... More
Don't let the price scare you on this one, it is a SUPER nice hotel! It's a new hotel, right in front of the convention center for anyone who is looking near there! The beds were super comfy and the room came with a full sized fridge and full kitchen, which was a very nice addition. There was also a... More
We were passing through during the 75th annual Sturgis Rally and stayed here on our way to Mount Rushmore. This was a nice hotel with free internet, great hot tub and free breakfast. Would stay again if in the area. We stayed on top floor to keep away from noise above our heads as they were full for the night.
My wife and I dropped off the kids with their grandparents and were heading home but decided to stop for the night even tho we were only an hour away from home. we rented a single king size room witch had ample space and a nice seating area. The room was very clean and well arrange. The price was affordable... More

It was a rather tiny room, but it was very clean and it was within short walk to the Missouri River. The room featured a king size bed and it was reasonably priced. We would not hesitate to stay there again.
We had stayed in the past and were very happy with the service, restaurant , overall experience, thus when we came back to Deadwood at the end of November, 2015 we wanted to stay there again. Huge mistake! Our room was freezing cold (59 degrees) when we checked in. We were told it would warm up a degree or two... More
We just got back from Deadwood last weekend we stayed two nights at the Bullock because it was on the ghost hunters, looked interesting. We stayed in room 209, they missed their mark in their advertising. First they do not have a full service restaurant they serve only breakfast and are closed on Mondays their bar is only open in...

With the TV series Deadwood out there, we had to stay at the Bullock Hotel. In fact, we stayed in the Bullock Suite, complete with hat hanging in the room - the kind Seth Bullock wore. The room was appointed in fancy late 1800s early 1900s style and contained a jacuzzi tub. It was looking over Main street. We liked... More
Our stay was a wonderful experience. The staff was very friendly and the room was cozy. For anyone who likes thrills, the ghost tour is a must do. There are lots of stuff to do in the town and would love to return.
We stayed overnight for convenience to an early morning flight. The rooms were small, clean, comfortable and modern. Everything you need for a restful stay. Surprisingly we did not notice the airport noise at all. So great to walk through a door and be in the airport. Every airport should have a hotel like this.
We drove from Michigan and stayed a night in Wall on the way to Yellowstone. We stayed in a double room as we had 4 people (Wife, Sis and Bro inlaws). We pulled into town early hoping we'd catch the Badlands at sunrise. We figured we'd go ahead and pay for our stay and be ready for check in at... More
The rooms are basic and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful, both by e-mail and in person. The price is extremely reasonable. Not for people expecting luxury, but we enjoyed our stay very much!
My husband said it's the best 2 nights sleep he has had in ages. The staff were all wonderful and very professional. We loved it here and will come back. We highly recommend this hotel Arvy and Cindy Sioux Falls SD
We checked in on Sunday, 5/17/15.. Jackson welcomed us and gave us an excellent room. The price was reasonable and walking distance to Applebees Restaurant. Would stay here again if we are traveling in SD.
