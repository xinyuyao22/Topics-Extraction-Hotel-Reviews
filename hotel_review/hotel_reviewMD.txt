This was our second time at this hotel. We found this to be a great place to stay. The beds were comfortable and nice linens. The room was immaculate, the complimentary breakfast was good and the 24/7 coffee and tea was appreciated. There was a great space to gather with friends that were also staying at the hotel. It is...

Staying here for couple weeks, it's a standard Hampton, clean, nothing exceptional. Some rooms have sofa area which is nice. Microwave and decent size mini fridge to grab a few things for the room. Pretty quiet, parking is good, easy access to local restaurants and shopping. Highway access is ok, odd on/off ramps here but haven't had an issue. This... More
The room was fine but the blue tape around my door was questioning but I did not have time to find out what was going on. The king size room I had, had enough space for a sofa bed. Plug attachment nice.
Sorry to have to say that this was a total disappointment. When I checked in, I was told that someone had called and cancelled the last two nights. I informed the clerk that did not happen and she argued that there was a note on the booking. I should have left then. The room was sprayed with something to cover... More
This is a clean, quiet, friendly hotel near maryland live casino. I always stay here when i pass thru baltimore. I've stayed here over 30 times in past 2 years. The front desk staff is so wonderful and they always go above and beyond to take care of my needs. Especially Shelley and Chrystal who are always there to help... More
Really you have to discard your first impression. And, if we are honest, your second. I opened the door to my room and feared I had selected the wrong option in Friendsville -- but in my experience after a few days, I think I would stay again. My room was a king room on the second floor facing the pool.... More
My wife and I started shopping around for a oceanfront hotel ,on the boardwalk, in Ocean City MD about a month before our trip. We checked rates and reviews on many places and found this to be the best. The hotel has been nicely refurbished and everything was good and in working order. We had a non oceanfront room, but...

Stayed here Memorial Day Weekend 2016, we had a king room with jacuzzi, non-ocean view. The room was very clean, well maintained, and the bed was very comfortable. Our room had a mini fridge, small kitchen sink, and a microwave. This hotel IS PRIME LOCATION on the Boardwalk at 25th street, far enough away from the beach bars to not... More
Very nice hotel only about a year old. Rooms were very clean, nice size with very comfortable bed and furnishing including a microwave and fridge. Inside was well lighted and smelled new. We were on the second floor. Brunswick is a Railroad town and many of the railroad engineers stay at the hotel Check in is a the Diner. Diner... More
I spent one night at the Courtyard at the Washingtonian Center and was beyond pleased. I received a notification that my room was ready 3 hours before I was encouraged to check in. The front desk employee was very polite and informed me that I was upgraded to a room that overlooked the pond. My room was clean and had... More
We were looking for a nice getaway weekend, and this really fit the bill. With the restaurants and shops available in the immediate area, we didn't have to move the car all weekend. The hotel itself, one of two Marriotts in the immediate vicinity, was terrific. Good staff, very nice room, marvelous shower, and a very good (if pricey) buffet... More
My travels brought my family and me to the Frederick area for a family birthday. The Fairfield Inn was quick, convenient, and absolutely easy for the check in and check out process. With our stay came a complimentary full fledged breakfast buffet. Thanks Marriott once again for making life and our stay so effortless.
The hotel looks brand new. The surrounding area is restaurants and a shopping mall. It is very quiet and the staff is very friendly and professional. I very much recommend this hotel. There is an indoor pool that we did not get to experience but if we come back to town we sure will.
JoAnne's cheese steaks are awesome. I also like the hot turkey sandwiches. There is a wide variety of items to choose from on the menu. Prices are reasonable and service is good. May take a bit longer if there is a large crowd.
Overall pleasant stay, food was great and staff was courteous and very helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel for future, similar events. Hotel is also conveniently located to the mall, grocery store, pharmacy, and movies
Just needed a night away for myself and so here is where I stayed. The room was very nice and the hotel was very quite. Met a friend for dessert and it was pretty tasty. Lakesha was very friendly and patient with us as we chatted while she was trying to set up the surrounding tables. Although I was five... More
I stayed the weekend with my fiance and kids and we had a great time. The staff was very welcoming, the hotel is very upscale at an economy price. The location was perfect for us to hit the mall, movie theater and other local attractions. After a day of fun, it was great to unwind in the pool and hot... More
After being in a sketch place in Virginia we booked this room last minute. The front desk lady, Stella was very helpful and professional. And the manager Helen was nice as well. She was able to check us in so we can head to Washington DC faster. They had free shuttle to the metro but we decided it would be... More
I stayed in this Courtyard for work and was there a total of 4 nights. I have stayed in many hotels and the staff at this one was top notch. Now, mind you I prefer my staff friendly, sociable, and low key. Each morning they were extremely pleasant when I got breakfast (even though they were extremely busy) and very... More
This clean, well-designed motel is also staffed with friendly, well-trained staff members. The beds and bedding are the best! The fresh, warm cookies are too! Nice breakfast included in the cost of the room as well. Our first-floor room was spacious and quiet, right across from the indoor pool and the exercise room. I am getting to be a devoted... More
I stayed at this Hampton Inn with my boyfriend for our 1 year anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better stay. The staff was great, room was clean and comfortable, and we had easy access to Easton and St. Michaels. I have stayed at many Hampton Inns over the years, and this one had to have been my... More
Stayed here during June of this year, the staff was very friendly. The front desk people are hilarious and kind. The rooms are nice, honestly for the low prices I expected it to be like a super 8 with blankets that looked like my grandma's curtains but it was a very nice room! Anything I needed they were happy to... More
The worse motel stay. I will never stay here again. Corrosion on the faucets. They stressed no smoking in the rooms and have you sign acknowledgement. However, when i entered my room the smell of cigarettes met me at the door. After I complained they sprayed a deodorizer. Let me say cigarettes and deodorizer cover don't smell good. I then... More
We were in town for a girls weekend. We had stayed with Clarion(Marigot Beach) several years prior and were pleased. This time we were very disappointed with the room. We stayed in a 3 bedroom suite, the view was beautiful, the staff was very polite, but the room was not so nice!! Very dirty(especially the kitchen) thank goodness we were... More
We had a great week. The condos were clean and had a great view of the ocean. The facility was great enjoyed our week. I would stay here again and already have signed up for next year. The staff was great....
This was a return visit to the Mt Washington Conference Center. Our room was very comfortable, with exceptionally good beds. The grounds are extensive with a variety of lovely trees and plants. Rooms come with a extensive continental breakfast, and use of well-equipped fitness center in McAuley Hall, accessible by indoor corridor. Room was clean, staff were helpful, and staff... More

I stayed here recently for a conference. The lobby was lovely with some decoration for the holiday. The front desk staff was always very friendly, but it didn't feel like a front desk due to the layout and design of the building. It will make sense if you go in. The room was nice for the price. There was a... More
We had car trouble while on our way home from vacation. The owners were extremely helpful, went above and beyond to help us. Most any other hotel would not want to bother. Thank you! The room was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay again.
