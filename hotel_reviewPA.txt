This hotel was nice and quiet. Did not know, there was train track near by. But it was only few train passed during our stay. Best Western changed hotel classification. The Plus category are not the same as before.
We stayed in the king suite with the separation between the bedroom and the living space. The sofa bed wasn't very good I had back discomfort by the day we left on our three night stay. The room is clean, and the king bed very comfortable. This hotel is located within walking distance to most places you will want to... More
Parking was horrible, somebody ran into my rental car while staying there. I didn't get to try the breakfast, I was there for business so the restaurant opened to late for the business world to enjoy, I had to asked for coffee for my room, And the items in the vending machine were stale.
Not cheap but excellent location. Price is somewhat standard for not hacing reservations. But room was nice and clean. They offer good continental breakfast which is a plus and compensates. Front desk service and personnel where excellent. It is Carmel, no A/C in rooms but they have a fan for air circulation.
If you get the room that they advertised on the website and for what you paid, you may be lucky.If you stay many days , they will give you the not so good rooms.Nobody wants to stay in these rooms: low light/dark rooms, near pool, noisy, smelly bathrooms, or difficult access. If you stay one-two days you will get probably... More
This is such a fun, lovely hotel. The attention to detail is impressive, from the thicker rimmed water glasses to the extra fluffy towels. Loved the vibrant art which lends itself to a hip vibe. My only disappointment was at their restaurant, the Lockbox. The menu is just trying too hard. I am a fairly adventurous eater but each of... More
We recently stayed at this hotel on a trip to Lexington with other friends. Our group shared the feeling that we would not be back. We routinely waited more than 10 minutes for elevators. The workout room is tiny with 2 treadmills and 2 cheap elliptical machines that rocked off the floor when in use. Everything about the hotel seemed... More

This is a new Hampton Inn and is well decorated. The color scheme gives a feeling of luxury and is very restful. The beds are comfortable and the black out curtains keep the room dark for a good nights sleep. The entrance is a little difficult to find so look closely for the sign. The staff was very friendly and... More
I stayed here for three nights while I explored nearby Santa Barbara. This place is ok for a night or two, if you can live the excess noise coming from the freeway, then three nights is just about doable
Completely accommodating hotel! I booked a reservation last minute day of, used points to offset the cost and even called the front desk to ask for a little help. They were completely kind and welcoming, especially accommodating while under construction. Thank you!
The water is very hot and there's no cold water at all... It's awful.. The food is not good.. The staff is friendly and very nice.. More upscale items should be offered for the price of the room at 200. A night! Snacks, toiletries, menus and food and drinks offered.. Promote your business... I'm sorry to hear we didn't exceed your expectations but thank you for bringing these issues to our attention. We take your feedback seriously and will share it with the staff. I hope we'll get another opportunity to make a better impression when you return to New Orleans. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss your stay further. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Great staff and rooms. Housekeeping was always spot on--we never saw them come in, and it was in perfect order when we came back to our rooms. The hotel is close to everything, French Quarter, museums, business district, etc. And we got a GREAT price for our stay. It's an excellent value--highly recommend to anyone visiting New Orleans!
This Hotel, formerly a prestigious bank, may be attractive for history buffs, but is an expensive and horrible place to stay when you visit New Orleans. The rooms are SMALL, unattractive, with terrible old bedding, virtually without windows or amenities. Parking was 38/day, and it took 35 min. to get your vehicle. Almost no lobby or sitting area, the restaurant was small, understaffed, with a severely limited menu. The commode was crammed into a tiny bathroom, and we had to call down to get them to bring up an old beat-up refrigerator. There are SO Many other more attractive places to stay in New Orleans, less expensive, I would avoid this place like the plague.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit. Sincerely,Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Very accommodating staff. Competitive pricing for downtown N.O. convenient location. Comfortable room. Good food in restaurant. Broken exercise equipment. 'fitness club' is a bit of a misnomer. We can recommend this to anyone else for a good place to stay with great location for many attractions.Thank you very much for your comments about your most recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel! We are working on getting updated exercise equipment and I'm sorry it wasn't ready for you by the time you arrived. I am happy to hear that you had such an enjoyable stay overall and we hope to see you again the next time you come to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Room was much larger than I expected, and water and fridge were offered for my room - had everything I needed. Nice basic breakfast was included. Room was very clean and everyone here was friendly! Would stay again. We're thrilled to hear you had a great New Orleans experience at the Whitney Hotel. Thank you for mentioning the breakfast and the cleanliness of the rooms. Our staff strives for excellence and I'm glad to see that was provided. We hope to see you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The Whitney Hotel is ideally located to see most of the sights of New Orleans. I would say it is a place to lay your head but I found the restaurant poor in terms of food choice and quality. The room phone did not work, no room service offered and the room can be noisy as it overlooks a major road. Overall, I think we can do better on my next trip to New Orleans.Thank you mentioning how you enjoyed the location and cleanliness of the Hotel, I'll pass that information along. I'm sorry to hear about the telephone and will have Engineering test the line. On behalf of the Management of the restaurant, please accept my apologies. I'll make sure they get a copy of this review. Thank you again for your candid comments and we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. If we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This is an old hotel in very good location. A 5 minute walk to Bourbon Street and Harrahs' Casino. A 15 min walk will get you to Caffe DuMonde and the French Market. Although old, the hotel is well kept and the staff is efficient. I found the room a little bit small, but confortable.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A.

The hotel is historic and yet modern. Full of history. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Orleans. Blocks from the French Quater and the Riverfront. The staff was very courtis and very knowledgeable. Always there to help get you where you want to be. Just one block to Mothers one of the local best restaurants. Totally enjoyed my stay On behalf of the staff at the Whitney Hotel, thank you so much for your recent visit and for the wonderful review. We'll share your praise with our staff and sincerely hope we'll get to see you again soon. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This hotel aptly named the Whitney Hotel as it was the location of the Whitney Bank.Several of the features of the bank era are there to be seen such as the strong room doors and related features.This hotel is in a very good location very close to local transportation - buses and streetcars.A short walk takes you to many places to eat, drink and shop.Less than ten minutes walk to Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street.Pleasant ambience, friendly staff and comfortable rooms. We had a noisy air con and after underlining our concerns were moved to another room and provided with free on the house breakfast.The hotel has partnership with some eating/licensed businesses plus a two for one offer for Mardi Gras World.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A.

We recently had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans and we chose to stay at the Whitney based on user reviews, location, and price. The room was very nice and was really clean. The hotel was well decorated. The one big call out I have is that the restaurant accepts room charges and cash only! As a rule, I won't support a business that doesn't accept credit cards for payment. Valet parking or a paid lot across the street are your parking options.Thank you for recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and for your kind comments. I'll be sure to pass this along to the staff. Please let us know if you need any reservation assistance in the future. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Our room was beautiful, the location was wonderful just a couple of blocks from shopping, Bourbon Street and an easy walk to Jackson Square. There are great restaurants in walking distance as well as the restaurant in the hotel. Dinner in the vault was fabulous.The service was outstanding.Even one of the maintenance men held doors for me and gave great advice on where to eat. Loved it and can't wait to go back. Thanks especially to Jason who really took great care of us.We appreciate your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and are so happy to hear you enjoy your stay! We'll pass along your kind comments to the staff and we look forward to hosting your next New Orleans trip! Feel free to call the hotel directly for any travel needs. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Excellent service and location was perfect. Have been in New Orleans numerous times so we didnt need to be in the heart of French Quarter which could be very noisy. dont get me wrong, love a good time let the good times roll but when I want to sleep I prefer quite.. Staff very helpful , great new restaurants in warehouse district....Thank you for the great review and for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We certainly appreciate the kind words and we are looking forward to hosting your next trip to the Big Easy!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
I will never consider staying at the Whitney after my epic night of uncomfortable room temperatures and a night's sleep on the hardest, cheapest mattress I've every experienced. The hotel staff was nonexistent and are complaints were only listened to AFTER check-out.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit. Sincerely,Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The hotel was alright, this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same, rude staff, bugs in room, room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday, our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable, you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday, declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task, a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property, even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and, at the time, confirmed by you. We thank you for giving us another opportunity. We sincerely hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans. As always, if we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Managercasey.callaiswhitneyHotel.com

Recently stayed at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. The hotel was an exceptional experience from the old 1910 building to the amazing queen suite. We would make any future visits to New Orleans included a stay at the Whitney Hotel. Front desk staff helpful, friendly and very informational about locations in the city. Parking was somewhat priced out there but the valet service took good care of our truck and promptly brought it to us when we called for it. Would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to experience New Orleans in actual history and ambience.Thank you for the great review and for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel! We'll pass along your kind comments to the staff and look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral ManagerCasey.CallaisWhitneyHotel.com
Unfortunately, it is not a place to have confidence. One of my children left a small amount of money in the car. When we left the hotel we realized they had stolen it. Although it was little amount of money, the fact is equally repudiable.Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your recent visit and will use the information you provided here to enable additional training and exceed future expectations. Please accept my apologies for not doing so during this visit. I hope you'll consider giving us another opportunity to make a better impression during your next visit. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with my 13 month old son and our experience was disappointing from the moment we checked in. When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear we didn't meet your needs initially with the crib. We've found that most prefer a soft-side crib over the steel framed ones. Once your requests were understood, though, our desk agents promptly retrieved a crib that was to your liking. We truly do appreciate your feedback and will use to provide better experiences. Thank you. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
What a wonderful weekend spent with my husband. Staff, Food, Rooms, everything was great. So welcoming and professional from arriving to departure. Location is perfect. Not to busy, but many thing within walking distance to explore in the big city. Defiantly will be back soon... Wouldn't stay anywhere else! Thank you for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel. We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and look forward to hosting your next trip to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
This was a beautiful hotel. All the things that made it a bank are still there, reminding you of the lovely banks that we used to have. The fact that part of the building is still an operating bank was a surprise. Everything was lovely. I did not eat in the restaurant because the rest of my party wanted to go other places , but we should have eaten there. We went to Mother's we had the worst meal that any of us ever had. I would highly recommend this hotel for a great stay its location.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and we appreciate the great review. We look forward to hosting your next stay, feel free to contact us for future reservations.Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. However, the hotel itself seemed to be a hodgepodge of various updates through the years. It seems staff has been trained to blame it on Katrina but when you stay its clear that the owner has not sufficiently maintained the facility through the years and when maintenance was performed, done so at the cheapest cost no matter how unsightly. the hotel has a lot of potential but is not a boutique by any stretch of the imagination. the windows are original so they are thin. curtains did not properly open and close. AC was loud and inconsistent at keeping a steady temp. using an old mercury thermostat. continental breakfast was paltry compared to others hotels.Dear Josephcarter2018,Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I apologize that your stay fell short of our high service standards. We truly consider all feedback to be a critical part of our success. We pride ourselves on the high levels of service provided to our guests and I am very sorry to hear that was not the case during your stay. Your honest feedback is greatly important to us as we continue working to make improvements and please rest assured that your comments have been heard and passed along to senior management. Thank you again and I truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to visit again in the future.
My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Whitney Hotel. We chose it for its mid-way location between the WWII and the Ogden Art Museums, and the French Quarter. It is also only a block from the Charles St. trolley to the Garden District.Our 6th floor king-bed room was a little small by king standards, but didn't feel cramped. The only smallness inconvenience was a lack of night stand and light on one side of the bed (no room). The bed and pillows were excellent and the room clean. The bath room had ample space for both of our toiletry bags, and there was a nice tub/shower with great towels. The provided shampoo and other products were of high quality.Since our room was directly above Poydras Street, a busy thoroughfare, we expected some noise and on the first night, which coincided with a Saints NFL game, we got it. However the noise subsided about 10 PM after the game traffic cleared and each of the subsequent nights were pleasantly quiet. The A/C was efficient and quiet.This is a smaller hotel (compared with the mammoth nearby Sheraton) and the staff were always available and pleasant. There is a restaurant on the premises (we only had one breakfast there - very good) but many, many fine restaurants in all price ranges are within 5-10 min walking distance. I felt the hotel was a great value for the price and would gladly stay again.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! Thank you for the great review and we look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We booked this hotel as it offered close proximity to the the centre of New Orleans and it offered disabled facilities in 'superior' rooms. We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that. If there is further information you would like me to review, please don't hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Special birthday trip for 5 days. We narrowed our choices on Hotels.com to finally choose The Whitney. We stay at many 'upscale' hotels in our business travels, and wanted an 'experience'. Location - perfect, a couple of blocks to the French Quarter, 3 or 4 to the Riverwalk, great food nearby. Starting with Earl (the Pearl) checking us in, and Michelle (long brown hair) made us feel comfortable far beyond the typical experience. They were knowledgeable and available for any of our needs wants, as other staff including housekeeping, they are great!Cleanliness rates a 10+Southern Hospitality 10+We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit to the New Orleans and thank you for staying at the Whitney Hotel.

We look forward to hosting your next visit to the Big Easy!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral ManagerCasey.CallaisWhitneyHotel.com
The Hotel is within easy distance of both the French Quarter and the Warehouse district. This is a historic building built as a bank and office use, so rooms may be smaller than a normal hotel, but the building has character. The staff was 5 star by being attentive, friendly, and helpful. My room was very clean and comfortable. I will stay again.Thomas W, Thank you so much for the wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel and sharing your feedback with others on TripAdvisor! We greatly appreciate your comments and cant express to you our gratitude for your kind words about our hotel and our colleagues. I am very glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us! Thank you for the terrific review and for recognizing our great team for taking care of you. Thank you Again Thomas W.
We have stayed at The Whitney before, but had no idea that the hotel no longer had a bar nor restaurant. This is a sad commentary, since we enjoyed the hotel last year, and were looking forward to another visit. The staff was again cooperative, understanding, and friendly. But, the sink had only a trickle for water flow, and the engineer could not fix the problem. And, we were there for 5 ngts. I'm sorry to hear you did not enjoy your stay. There were some service issues with the previous food and beverage operation, which was contracted through a 3rd party. Due to this, a change was made and the hotel has started offering a free continental breakfast. While we've received mostly positive feedback about the change, we understand that some like a full service restaurant inside the hotel. Plans to reopen the bar are underway and with all the wonderful dining options in walking distance of the Hotel, our Front Desk team will always have a great recommendation for you. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope you come back and see us next year. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager

We enjoyed this lovely hotel. It was nice to go to breakfast and look up and see the beautiful architectural details. The bank vault of course was extraordinary. We learned that the hotel is still attached to a working bank. The restaurant was lovely and the bacon egg and cheese croissant was fresh and delicious. The room was nice enough and clean enough. We would definitely stay here again for a quick stay.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We greatly appreciate your kind words and look forward to hosting you again soon. If we can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us directly. Sincerely, Casey A.

The Whitney is about five blocks or so from Canal and on to the bars and restaurants of the French Quarter. At night it is a quiet walk past hotels and office buildings once you cross canal returning home. The staff is very friendly in that way New Orleans is. There is a small restaurant for breakfast and coffee if it is raining outside. Rooms are nice and quiet. Would definitely stay again.Thank you for this wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel.

For my mother's 90th birthday, she wanted to go to New Orleans (has not been since 1959) and we had a fabulous time. My thanks to the Whitney for making her feel so special, absolutely everyone at the hotel was gracious, helpful, polite and fun. The hotel was completely booked, but our spacious rooms/bathrooms were cleaned promptly and it was not noisy. I highly recommend the Whitney Hotel for the perfect stay in New Orleans...Cathy ThomasNashville, TNWe're so pleased to hear you enjoyed your trip to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and thank you for the kind words.

When my original room was not ready, staff upgraded me to suite, which was great, with one exception. Given the historic nature of the property, electrical outlets were not readily accessible. The location was great for the purpose of my trip. Everywhere I needed to go was w/in a block.Thank you for your recent visit and the great feedback you've left here at TripAdvisor. We look forward to seeing you again!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Managerccallaiswyndham.com
The bar closed at 10pm which was poorOnly 3 days into our 8 day trip we were told the bar and Resturant were closed leaving us with no facilities in the hotel We should have been told that when we were booking and would not have booked it as it's nice to eat and drink in the hotel after a long days walking around town Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations. The restaurant was a third party operation, not owned or managed by the Hotel and the decision to close the venue could not be controlled by the Hotel. To offset any inconvenience, the Hotel offered, free of charge, a grab and go continental breakfast. Please accept our apologies for the closure. If you feel there is any other information I need regarding your stay, please feel free to email me or call me on my direct line at 504-212-8686. Again, please accept my apologies and thank you for letting me know about your visit.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this Hotel. The room was clean, quiet for sleeping and comfortable. Very convenient for transportation and access to popular locations. I did not use the restaurant facilities, I think there could be a little more promotion for the dining room. Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A.

I was in town for the Crescent City Classic. The Whitney Hotel is easy walking distance to the start of the 10K race. Also close to the French Quarter and the WWII museum. I like the Central Business District and this location is very central for my purposes, with St. Charles street car close by to the Quarter and the Garden District. Very good value compared to comparable hotels. I have stayed here twice before and will try to stay here again my next trip. Was a good hotel for me.We're so happy to have loyal guests such as yourself coming back again and again to the Whitney Hotel! Thank you for your continued patronage and the wonderful review. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Hotel is older but quite nice. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are well appointed and quite modern. There is a bit of traffic noise from the street (I was on the 3rd floor) but this is to be expected downtown in a major city. (plus I was there the day the St. Patrick's day parade occurred, and its route took it right by the corner of the hotel). I didn't use the restaurant but it looked very decent. It's quite close to the various things to do or a quick cab ride away if you don't want to walk. I would certainly stay there again.Thank you for the great review and for your visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! It certainly was a pleasure hosting your stay. If we can be of any other assistance in the future, please let us know. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Stayed for one night. Hotel is in a great location to walk to Superdome for Saints game and have dinner at the great Restaurants in the warehouse district. Hotel is clean and quiet. Loved how the lobby and check in area still have the large safe and bank windows throughout. Thank you for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We're happy to hear you enjoyed your visit and appreciate the great review! We look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We stayed 1 night. while the hotel was beautiful and the staff were pleasant,I inquired about extra charges to my card, no one knew why. I then emailed twice and called again (international as I was on my honeymoon) with no response!!! How frustrating to know so much was charged without a reason why or enteraction from staff!I am very sorry to hear about what has happened during and after your stay with us.

Stay at The Whitney to capture a sense of the history of New Orleans with its actual bank vault door decor, and location that is right in the heart of New Orleans great for business but close to the French Quarter for fun. It's clean, comfortable, has amenities, and is a great location, friendly too.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Overall, good trip. Clean and friendly! It was mid summer when we stayed and we prefer ice cold room. Couldn't get it cool enough. Bed was comfy. Pillows a bit too thick for us. Cold water at faucet was warm to hot. Shower temp was perfectly hot. Would recommend more mirrors in room. A safe would be good addition and fridge. Enjoyed continental breakfast. Would stay at this beautiful hotel again. Thank you for the great review and your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We certainly appreciate you kind words and will pass them on the staff. It's our pleasure to provide excellent customer service to our guests. We look forward to hosting you again in the very near future. Sincerely, Jason LaBicheGuest Service Manager
Our recent stay at the Whitney was overwhelmingly nice. The hotel is housed in the historic old Whitney Bank Building. The reception desk was once the teller desk and the old vault is located in the lobby. Our suite was very large with two rooms. The master bedroom was quite spacious and was separated from the sitting area by French doors. The sitting area had a sofa bed it's own television. The bathroom was also very spacious. The hotel offers free internet as well as complimentary coffee. There is a restaurant located in the lobby. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel is located right off of Saint Charles Avenue which is very convenient during Mardi Gras and only a half a mile from the French Quarter. I will be staying again!!!On behalf of the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans, thank you for your visit and kind words on TripAdvisor. We hope we'll get another opportunity to serve you again during your next trip to the Big Easy!Kindest Regards, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
I have stayed at the Whitney many times for business, back when it was a Wyndham property and now that it is a New Orleans Collection Hotel. Staff is friendly and efficient, rooms are clean. At some point soon they will need to address carpet as it is getting dated, but OK now. Bar downstairs is good as is restaurant. We ate breakfast a couple of times at Cafe on the Square around the corner and had good experiences.Thank you for your continued patronage at the Whitney Hotel. We are in the planning stages now for replacing carpet throughout the hotel. Thank you again and we look forward to hosting your next visit to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Whitney. The beds were very comfortable. The location is superb. It is walking distance to everything we did, French Quarter, Bourbon Street, shopping, Harrah's, etc. We will definitely stay here during our next trip to New Orleans. The staff was rather gracious as well. Loved it!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write a review regarding your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
Super friendly and accommodating staff. Staff bent over backwards to assure we had a great stay. Always ice cold water, news papers and vacation information in the lobby. Great restaurant recommendations. We ubered from the airport 33-55 . You do not need a car in the city. Street car on one side of hotel. 2 blocks to French quarter and bourbon street. Near casino and ww2 museum. Beds super comfortable and hotel is really clean. Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We greatly appreciate your kind words and look forward to hosting you again soon. If we can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us directly. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
We enjoyed the hotel. Location was great walking distance to many sites. Paying to park was a surprise, but we decided that was better than staying further away and worrying about parking.Hotel was absolutely beautiful. Very nicely maintained. No old hotel odor. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was nice, very comfortable kept very clean by friendly housekeeping staff. Lovely city view. Traffic noise was noticeable. Bathroom was good sized, had a great shower, and was nicely kept. Restaurant was beautiful. Food adequate but not exceptional. Limited hours. Service friendly but I actually got up to get my own coffee refills one morning even though only two tables had customers. Overall a great experience and we would definitely stay again and recommend it to others.Thank you for your recent visit. We appreciate your feedback and look forward to hosting your next stay at the Whitney Hotel!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager

I found this hotel online, and it came highly recommended. It was convenient to everywhere in the city I wanted to go, though its location on Poydras street did mean the mornings were a little noisier than I expected due to the traffic, but you can't fault them for that. I had occasional difficulty with my room key working but still always got into my room. I didn't realize at booking that the hotel doesn't have a bar/restaurant and the room didn't have a refrigerator but that was my fault for not checking. Overall the staff was incredibly helpful, friendly, and made my stay. The hotel is very unique and original due to its history and not like every out-of-the-box hotel you find these days. It was nice to stay in a place with such character. Res877, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us at The Whitney Hotel. We are delighted to know that you enjoyed your stay and thank you for pointing out the amazing service you received from our staff.

We had a wonderful stay at the Whitney hotel. The front desk staff headed by Patrick were the best that I have ever experienced. They were extremely helpful in making reservations at great restaurants, guided us through the craziness of Mardi Gras and were always friendly and helpful in every way. The rates were a good value and the location was ideal.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. Thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review and for mentioning the wonderful service Patrick provided. I'll be sure to let him know.

Room was very clean and well appointed. Everything you need for an extended stay. Bed was very comfy. Front desk was extremely accommodating. I had a very late check-in due to another engagement and there was no issue. Highly recommend.
We were at the Club Pulse for just one night. Everything was perfect, staff at the front desk were very friendly and knowledgeable, everyone we ran into was professional and nice, the room was super comfy. We had a suite with a kitchenette (microwave, refrig with freezer unit, coffee maker, dishes, flatware, glasses for water and wine), 2 televisions - one in the bedroom the other in the living room. The seating was very comfortable and a table to eat. I highly recommend this property. We were in town to see the play Hamilton, we were easily able to walk to the Gas Lamp for dinner and then to the Civic Theater.Thank you for a perfect review! We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay and look forward to welcoming you back again sometime.
My wife and I stayed this past weekend at the Marriott Pulse. Nice hotel with great amenities. Good location in downtown San Diego. Only 4 blocks to the gaslamp district with many choices of restaurants in the area. 1 bedroom unit is a little small compared to other Vacation Club properties so would be tight if 4 are staying in one of these units.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
We ended our San Diego stay here, with 4 nights. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was comfortable, and, surprisingly, the pull out sofa bed was the most comfortable I have slept on. The fitness center was clean, and had a good variety of equipment. The parking fee is steep, but standard for a large city. Good luck going around the spiral getting in and out of the garage. Easy access to everywhere we needed to go.
accused of smoking in my room. only young black kids in the hotel. ima 24 year old well put together chef. needed time away with my girlfriend. Managers and loss prevention kept harassing us. Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about, but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones. You service was so bad , and biased my girlfriend told me not to complain about the towels or buy from your marketplace. This is going to get solved in a court matter. This was the worst experience i have had at a hotel and i travel frequently.
Stayed here September 2018 for 7 nights hotel was amazing and should be rated a 5 star plus everything was perfect fantastic rooms amazing staff first class facilities great location close to all local attractions would highly recommend.Our team appreciates your review and recommendation on TripAdvisor. We are happy you enjoyed your visit to the resort and look forward to welcoming you back again in the near future.
My wife and I stayed here with our 2 grandchildren for 5 days in April. The room amenities are very nice with very comfortable bedding and living area. The Kitchen area is small, however, with a small mini refrigerator and microwave so if you are planning to eat many meals in your room, this is not the hotel for that. We walked to Little Italy, the Gas Lamp area, PETCO Park and to the USS Midway. Very convenient to all locations. They have Valet parking and a restaurant on property although we did not use it. They also have a fitness area and a indoor pool.Steve, thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you and your family enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego. We hope you will visit us again sometime.
This place was recently renovated and our room on the 23th floor felt like we were staying in a hi-end condo with breathtaking views of San Diego bay and the Coronado bridge. Sleek and modern decor with marble countertops stood out to me. There were two flat screen TV's, and a fully-stocked mini kitchen with fridge. Located right in the middle of downtown minutes away from the gas lamp district this place is prime location. The luxurious amenities combined with meticulous customer service especially in the downstairs restaurant makes for a memorable experience that I wouldn't hesitate to highly reccommend over and over again! Great job Marriott!Charles, thank you for a perfect review. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego. We hope you will visit us again sometime.
The issues started the first night. Do Not stay in room 1501. Although the room seems like it is a bit away from the elevators the bed room is right next to the elevator shaft. This would be fine if it was just elevator noise but every time it went up and down the banged like the someone was knocking on the door loudly. All night all day whenever someone was in the elevator. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy, Jared. He said that Otis elevator was actually on site fixing the elevators. They actually came to room but could not figure out where the noise was coming from. I did mention it again on Wednesday but they did not do anything. They could have at least moved me to another room. On Friday I was supposed to meet someone for dinner. I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit, unfortunately right when he called at 630. He tried again at 7. The staff did not leave a message on my room phone (or my cell/email which they had). At 9 I received a call from the front desk that I received 2 calls at 630 and 7. When I asked why I am just hearing about it at 9, the woman said the note got lost and they had just found it. Oh did I say the pool was closed. Lastly, 1501 is a joined room and on Friday night, at 11 a family decided to have a fight where someone was slapped and the mother and little daughter started crying. I called the office but as far as I know no one came up or called. Just not a good stay. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review.

I stayed at the Marriott Vacation Club Pulse during Memorial Day weekend from the Bay Area. Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage. The hotel staff took me to my room in a wheelchair and brought me ice and other items to assist with my pain. On top of that, they gave me a Get Well card signed by all the staff. The room is nice (not too big and not too small) and the furniture is well appointed. The bathroom is a really great size with the closets located inside the restroom along the wall (nice touch). Before I arrived I read the reviews where other travelers complained about a reflection on the sliding door that separates the living room from the bedroom at night. I did not experience that. I enjoyed the indoor pool/jacuzzi and the close proximity to the Donut Bar (the donuts are splendid), the House of Blues, as well as other restaurants, banks and stores. The street it is located on is more quaint than lively, but you're a stone's throw away from the action. The room service is great ( I ordered breakfast a couple of mornings) as well and the delivery team makes sure you're satisfied. They also have a discount card avail (not sure it's available to all traveler profiles) that you can use at nearby restaurants which was a plus. I really enjoyed this property which I will definitely book when I return to the San Diego area.Thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
This is a really modern hotel bang, smack in the centre of the great city of San Diego, California. And because it has most of anything you need at pretty high quality, it is not cheap. We stayed for two days and enjoyed both beertasting and whiskey/whiskytasting for only 5 each. The bartenders, John and Ben, did a fine job! Breakfast is not included, but it's not very expensive and you have lots of choices. We didn't try the restaurant. They served us good hashbrowns and perfect eggs which were impressively fast on our table. Good selection of teas and real freshly squeezed orangejuice. Staff looks happy, not just polite. Great room, loved the chocolate! Fine beds, fridge and microwave in the livingroom and tv both there and in the bedroom. Modern fascilities for charging phones etc. Even if you need an extra plug, it's already there. Any niggles Well, parking in cities may be difficult, but 42 per night with valet and 35 without seems to me a bit over the top, the room comes at a price so it ought to be half the price for guests. After all, just a few blocks up you could park for free on the street. But will I stay there again if in SD Yes, of course.Thank you for your review and for taking the time to let us know about your stay! We are happy you had a great visit to the resort and look forward to more vacationgreatness with your family.
Stayed here for one night and really enjoyed it. The place is very modern and is being upgraded. The staff couldn't have been any nicer. Great bar with pretty good bar food.The bar tenders were super. Place was very clean. The only problem is you're a little removed from the action but a short Uber/Lyft ride and you're there.Worth going back to next time I'm in San DIegoThank you for your review. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
My husband has business here and I tagged along. What a fantastic hotel. The service is impeccable. When we checked in I had bruised my wrist, freak accident. My husband asked for an ice pad. They gave us 2 ice pads and was so concern. We checked into our awesome and perfect suite, not 5 minutes. We heard a knock on the door. Anthony, security management, was at the door with a note of well wishes for me plus a box of gourmet cookies. We were just blown away how fabulous his concern was for us as their guests. We can't say enough how awesome the service is for this hotel. Highly recommended. Wish I could give it a 6 stars. :)Thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
We got a couple of connecting suites, very confortable and with all the necesary ammenities. Stayed there for a week. Contemporary and stylish.What we liked the most was the location right in the middle of down town where there is a good array of restaurants, its close to the Glass Lamp area and to the trolley.Service was very kind at all times. The food was ok but for some reason lacking a bit in salt to our latino taste buds. But the coffee great. Restaurant open at all times which is practical.One thing that should be handled is the dirty windows from the outside. That takes away from the aesthetics.I definitely give it a thumbs up because its a good value for the money.It sounds like the perfect vacation at Marriott Vacation Club Pulse! Thanks for sharing and we look forward to more vacationgreatness with your family.
Beautiful modern king city view suite. A few quirks like 12th floor check in and directions needed to leave. Staff was very nice and helpful 40 per night off site valet parking but it was pretty quick. Walking distance to Gaslight district. Close to waterfront and airport. Overall great value Thank you for your review. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
If you are driving then this is for you! A bit of walk to tram and facilities.It's an old style hotel with bigger rooms that's a plus, however I would definitely check out the location next time! Breakfast selection is not a great option, it certainly a reasonable feed!Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to complete the Guest Satisfaction Survey in regards to your recent stay at the Four Points by Sheraton San Diego - SeaWorld.

First impression, I see vehicles parked tightly not only on the curved street immediately in front of this Four Points, but continuing as tight on the front end of this Four Points Hotel property up, with only a small passageway past their shuttle, to the hotel entrance. Never have I seen vehicles parked at this concentration at the front of any hotel before! Upon entering the Hotel, I see a very new hotel look and like what I see. I wait but a few minutes and then am assigned a room. Room 127, first floor. I checked in at about 9:30 PM Saturday night and that was what was available, but requested an upper floor room, if available, the following night. Duly noted.First room impression. Beautiful room so far. How do the lights work Not the usual toggle switch. No hint from the front desk about simple light operations, at all. Onward into the dark room until I get the lights on. No master switch. Every light has its own switch. Bathroom has three. Awesome bathroom with glass doors.First night room impression. HVAC works well. Not too loud. People walking down, and talking loudly, the hallway can be heard clearly ! People running or walking upstairs sound loudly. Slamming doors on every room are very loud inside my room. Screaming or running children are not silent! The sound of dripping water from from an upper level HVAC unit sound like tapping on my window tap most of the night long. Second night impression. Moved upstairs to Room 226. No more frequent travelers headed for upper levels. Same drip drip drip sound from an upper level HVAC unit dripping on my window frame, or HVAC frame. Only on screaming child in the hall about 7:30AM.The desk personnel were very simple and personal. They helped me move a room request. Parking impression. Ugly. Animal like. You gotta be kidding me. This is a Sheraton Hotel! Owners, take a look. This is not a dog race arena parking lot!Sheraton alert! Sheraton alert! Sheraton alert!Good day Gregory N,Thank you for this very detailed feedback and for choosing our hotel. We are happy to hear you were pleased with the appearance of our newly renovated property. In an effort to ensure our operations are environmentally friendly, we have equipped all our guest rooms with motion activated lighting that can also easily be adjusted manually. We are very sorry our team was not proactive in its explanation of the guest room light functionality and operation. We are also sorry to hear of the challenges you encountered with the noise level during your stay. We have shared this valuable feedback with our team and taken the necessary steps to rectify your concerns. We wish you the best and hope to see you again very soon.Thank you,JGFront Office Manager
The area was just off a busy freeway in what we described as the stripper neighborhood. I needed early checkin which I arranged months ago. Didn't get it. When we were able to check in noticed wet section if carpet. Thought maybe they cleaned something up. Next morning 1/4 room saturated. Went to front desk. They said probably Ac problem. They said no problem to fix. We left. 6 hours later returned problem not fixed and water is traveling. Went to front desk. They said something like this can't be fixed in a day. What did you expect Odd, I expected it fixed. Can you at least suck up the water No, we can't. Hmmmmm. You will get a new room. I said no, fix it. Our time is limited and on way out soon. They said they'd send someone to look at it. Twenty minutes in the bar (nice bar and staff) went up to room. Maintenance had it fixed in 5 minutes. They placed towels on floor where they stayed until we left. Thank you for your feedback. I apologize that we were unable to fix your air conditioning issue immediately. Through our several interactions with you early in the day, you were offered a room move several times until we could get the resources to fix the leak in your air conditioning. I am sorry that the staff that you spoke with were not more empathetic, but they did offer you alternate accommodations. We try to honor early check in requests, but that is dependent on the departure patterns and how quickly we can clean the rooms for the new arrivals. I hope that this does not prohibit you from joining us again.
This Sheraton hotel is very good. The rooms are very big and very clean. Air conditioner works excellent and it's a strong point. The service and people are the perfect. Parking lot avaiable and free. My suggestion is for breakfest, could bring more option of fruits. Just it, but it's very good.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to review the Four Points Sea World. we are happy to hear you really enjoyed the hotel. We hope to see you back in the near future.Sincerely,LBGeneral Manager
We really enjoyed our stay at the Four Points. The hotel is well furnished, clean, and comfortable. The bathroom is generously sized and updated.I enjoyed the stair access in the lobby so that I didn't have to take the elevator constantly. Our door did not close all the way - we just had to make sure we pulled it completely closed.My only criticism was the toiletries in the shower and the shower handle are poorly placed. I hit my elbow a few times and the toiletries caddy makes it hard to wash your hair under the shower.Hello,Well first of all I want to Thank you for staying with us at Four Points Sea World. We appreciate you taking the time to write a review, not to mention the very nice comments. Your feedback about the amenity caddy is much appreciated, I will have that looked into. We hope to see you back some time soon.Thank you,LBGeneral Manager
I used this hotel for an event we were having and Heather Gordon was amazing! She helped me coordinate 30 rooms and make sure that everybody had what they needed. The location was perfect since it was close enough to Gaslamp and Petco Park. Everyone enjoyed their stay and I enjoyed how easy it was to coordinate accommodations for 30 people. Thank you Heather and Sheraton!Hello,Thank you for the nice compliments, especialy about Heather. We think she's great as well. We appreciate you choosing the Four Points Sea World and for taking the time to write a review for us.Thank you once again.LBGeneral Manager
I stayed here for one night with my wife and two little kids. We were given a corner room with two queen beds which provided more than enough space for us. We were able to fit the toddler bed into the bathroom like we usually do. I chose this place in spite of the 15 parking fee, no free breakfast, and close proximity to a strip club (as mentioned in prior reviews). The room was clean and spacious. The highlight for me was the amazing bed and pillows. I stay at many different hotels and if this is the standard for Four Points I am very impressed. We also ate at the Denny's right across the street and went to Sea World the next morning refreshed and ready.
This comfortable , well appointed hotel turned out to be a very good choice for my short stay in San Diego. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet and early evening 'Happy Hours' were unexpected surprises. Casual dining at the bar or at the tables near the pool was ideal. The free wifi was appreciated but I was a little disappointed that the courtesy shuttle to and from the airport has been discontinued. The hotel is only a 15 min walk from the delights of the San Diego Old Town. The Transit Centre offers a choice of bus or Trolley downtown, or a no 30 bus for the 30 minute ride to La Jolla. A day pass covering both buses and trolleys is great value. With the distances between attractions in San Diego cab rides can be expensive.Good day Ronald S,We are so happy to hear you felt welcome in our home and we would like to thank you so very much for sharing your experience.

The hotel staff was friendly and engaging. The property appeared recently renovated and well kept up. You need to be prepared for the surrounding neighborhood. it's 100 feet from some of the sketchiest places you ever want to see. Not one but two strip clubs, a couple of adult bookstores and of course, the obligatory massage parlor beneath the bails bondsman. None of this is the hotels fault and I would certainly rate them higher if the neighborhood was a little nicer.Good day Carver123,Thank you for sharing your experience with our team. We are glad you found our team to be friendly and engaging. We are sorry to hear of your challenges with the surrounding area. While there is little our team can do to improve the surrounding area, we are certainly empathetic to your concerns and appreciate your feedback. We hope to see you again very soon. Thank youJGFront Office Manager
Having recently spent 45 days at this Hotel, and having been there for an extended stay prior to this trip, I feel uniquely qualified to write this review. First, I found the Staff to be extremely friendly, helpful and professional, always quick to respond to my requests and needs. Being a single, older woman, I was delighted to feel safe and secure during my stay. The room was clean and the appearance pleasing, the bed was very comfortable, and breakfast in the mornings was always good. In the late afternoon, it was fun having 'Happy Hour' with great prices on wine and a light food selection. I appreciated that there are washers and dryers located on each floor. The Hotel is near all of San Diego's most sought after sites, shopping, Old Town and it's a breeze to jump on freeways to go anyplace. I will most certainly be staying at the Four Points again.Hello,Thank you first of all for staying with us. The staff really enjoyed having you here and they were sad to see you go. I am so happy to hear you were so well cared for. I will definitely pass on the nice compliments to the staff.Thank you once again.LBGeneral Manager
I had a friend in town, so was looking for a San Diego hotel, but everything downtown/Gaslamp etc was over 300, so we decided to give this a try at 199 .. It was OK .. the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, but the walls are thin, and sounded like a herd of elephants in the room above us, early in the morning. I would suggest a higher-floor room, we were on the first floor. But, I can't say anything about the elevator situation. Don't see us needing to stay in SD again anytime soon, and there is really nothing about this property that beckons me back. Exiting the hotel parking area is hazardous, there are cars flying off the freeway, so you have to time your exit carefully!Hello,Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review the hotel. Happy to hear you enjoyed the room. Sorry for th issue with the noise.Sincerely,LBGeneral Manager
Well checked in was given room 183 couldnt stand the odor for more then 5 seconds.went to desk got a different room 153 was much better but still odor of mildew and mold.was given free breakfast which was ok.i wouldn't recommend to anyone unless i wanted to know what they thought of the place.Thank you for staying with us. We see that you have given us a rating of 1/5. With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are sorry to hear that we have not met your expectations. As a valued guest, your feedback will be shared with the team to continue to inspire and motivate them to deliver exceptional customer service. We sincerely appreciate your feedback.
The A/C unit under the window blows air directly on the bed. I like it cold when I sleep but in order to have the A/C on when I sleep it blows a wind chill on me in bed. I had to move yhe room chair in front of the A/C to block the air flow.
We really enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn Mission Valley. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. We especially enjoyed the wonderful complimentary breakfast every morning. There is also a pool, hot tub and fire pit. We will definitely stay here again!
This is a pretty new property that is conveniently located to Seaworld, downtown, and La Jolla. Staff was mostly polite, especially the breakfast staff. The room was clean. I liked the shower enclosure in the bathroom and the electronics charging station on the nightstand. The mattress was a bit firm for my taste. The only thing missing is a microwave in the room. Parking is 16/day, which is questionable. Breakfast was adequate--continental-type items, plus waffles, oatmeal, breakfast potatoes, eggs.Good Afternoon pe556ai,Thank you for your five star review, we are glad you had an excellent stay! We were thrilled to read that you enjoyed our central location, amenities, and your interactions with our team. Thank you for noting your preference for a microwave in the room. We understand the convenience this provides and do have some available for a nominal fee per night. On your next stay with us, we would be happy to note that preference to ensure your complete comfort. Thank you again for staying with us it was a privilege to have you as our guest.Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
The hotel is ok but considering you pay 19 a day for parking it should be better. There aren't many normal parking spots. You frequently end up in a parking structure in the back and walking stairs to reach your car. Breakfast is as expected at any similar property. Very busy on the weekend. And no matter how busy it is at 10am the doors will be locked. We were done but several people missed out. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Housekeeping pounded on our door and brought us towels at night we didn't ask for and when we told the front desk they acted like it was our fault for not refusing the towels.
I have to say that I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The customer service was excellent, the staff friendly and attended to my needs with a prompt response. Breakfast was also very good, rooms clean and overall appearance of the facility was impressive to say the least. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to San Diego. Thank you for the recommendation! We recently opened the hotel in July with the latest Hampton Inn design. We're pleased that our Team was able to accommodate your needs during your stay. We hope that we'll be your first choice should you return to the San Diego/Hotel Circle area.
We enjoy a lot our stay, I went whit my family and it was perfect. We ate a delicious breakfast ande the bed, the bathroom, the quiet was awesome. My family and I love Hampton Inn and in this opportunity it was the best.
The hotel is clean and the staff was excellent. There is no shuttle service but you can Uber for pretty cheap. The airport is only about 10 minutes away. The 18 a night for parking is absolutely ridiculous!! The hotel is close to most of the San Diego attractions including old town San Diego.
Very good hotel with easy access. Parking can be tight for 14/night when coming back late at night but there is room in the back. Surprised at the quality of the breakfast - get there early - and the pool area. Staff was very good.Good morning! Thank you for the valuable feedback. We're thrilled to see that you enjoyed our convenient, central location in San Diego our complimentary deluxe continental breakfast buffet. We hope to see you again soon!
Stayed here for a week (Sat. to Sat.) while visiting San Diego. The hotel was clean and free breakfast was great. The hotel seemed to be newer as evident by the modern decor.For those traveling with small children, our room only had a shower. Our 2 yr. old has only taken baths so he had to quickly get used to a shower, which did not end up being too bad for us. Location is excellent as you are 10 minutes from Sea World, Zoo, Balboa Park, USS Midway and much more. Parking is usually 16 a night but when we checked in they gave it to us for 10 a night! We rented a Hyundai Elantra and anything bigger would have been a pain to park as spaces seem very tight. This was not only at the hotel, but pretty much anywhere we parked in San Diego.
Likely the fanciest Hampton I have ever stayed in. Very large property, very modern and clean with a huge common area off the lobby. I think this Hampton may have the most awesome breakfast buffet in terms of size I have ever seen, and I have stayed at a LOT of Hamptons. Triple waffle iron area with 4 times the variety of toppings... say wahIn all seriousness, the rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The entire property was. The front desk staff was super friendly and welcoming. It felt like an upscale Hampton here.Now, they lost one star for two reasons - parking, they charge. To me it is insane to charge a customer for parking unless you are MAYBE downtown where I get parking is a commodity. This is Hotel Circle for crying out loud and they charge 18 bucks a day which is ridiculous. I have status with Hilton so they did lower my parking to 10 per day but it was still annoying and felt like they were simply trying to generate more revenue... particularly due to there was PLENTY of parking. The other reason was the housekeeping. We were there four nights and I had to call for housekeeping to come clean up my room. My husband had spilled a little something on the sheets and I was very surprised that they did not flip out the bottom sheet. Nope, left the stain there which was kind of gross. When they finally did clean, it was a half-hearted job, no toiletry or coffee refills, half the towels, etc. The front desk always came through for me though so it was not that big of a deal in the bigger scheme of things.
The location of the hotel was central to all of the surrounding attractions. We definitely loved the beautiful weather. The staff was very nice and were willing to help or assist when needed. I will definitely be back.
This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are quite nice. The large was extremely comfortable, but there were a few issues I experienced: - The hallways smelled of dirty wet dog. - There were outlets for charging on only one side of the King bed. - I expected liquid soap in the bathroom and shower as I've had at the last two Hamptons I've stayed at. - There is a hotel being demolished on one side of the hotel, so the construction noises started fairly early. - The breakfast buffet was extremely sub-par. The paper plates and plastic utensils were just tacky and I expected more from a Hampton. The food options were lacking, the fruit was not fresh, the eggs had an odd flavor, there were no breakfast meats at all, and the self-serve coffee was empty and when I politely alerted a staff member, I was basically ignored.Dear Will L,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us. At the Hampton Inn San Diego Mission Valley, we want our guests to have the best stay possible, one where everything exceeds their expectations. I want to personally apologize that this was not the case for your stay with us. We are humbled by your feedback, but thank you for providing us with the opportunity grow and improve as a hotel and team.

I hope to hear from you soon.Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
- Great Hotel and Staff - Perfect location - Right off the Freeway, close to all restaurants, 7 mins away from OLD town, 10 minutes from downtown, 15 from the beach. - Free Breakfast is a must - Very Friendly staff on the floor and kitchen.Dear Gaganjot S,Thank you for your five star review. We appreciate you recognizing our great team and making note of our prime location. Thank you again for your feedback and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
Location is easy to get to and even though the room is small it met our needs.Staff is very friendly and helpful in assisting any requests we had.Room was in need of a carpet vacuum - which was not done during the 3 days we were there.Good afternoon! Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate your comments and will use your feedback to make improvements to the services we provide. We truly enjoyed hosting you in our Boardroom and look forward to welcoming you back the next time you're in San Diego!
Best hotel ever. Right by mission bay beach. Rooms are beautiful extremely clean. Parking could be larger but manageable. Definitely a 4 star hotel n Hampton is always a pleaser to stay at while on vacation.
super friendly staff, average breakfast, free wifi, 16.00 per night parking, good AC in room, good bedding, average cleanliness, lots of kids, family hotel no good restaurants close by...easy freeway access better than most hotels on the circle
Excellent service.. Very welcoming staff. Always smiling and willing to assist in any way. I traveled without my husband and took my three sons and a friend of there's and we all survived the stay without any casualties Dear anacU7065VB,Thank you for your 5-star review! I am thrilled to read that our team delivered an exceptional experience and can't wait to share your kind words with them. Thank you for staying with us and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
Stayed at this Hampton with my family for College Tour at UCSD and SDSU. It's a great location, very centrally located to the colleges, downtown, restaurants and beaches. It located on what's called Hotel Circle. I will definitely stay there again next time in SD. Room was very clean and everything works as it should. Free WiFi could be faster speed but that's minor.
I was traveling to see my son graduate from Marine boot camp and I couldnt be more pleased with the friendly and helpful service I received from ALL the staff. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful with activity tips, dining, shopping etc.
This hotel is wonderful: friendly, helpful staff, very clean, nice decor with a good feel. Parking lot is easy in and out with plenty of parking close to the doors. The breakfast is as good as they always are at Hampton Inn's. There's something for everyone. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying the breakfast with as many choices as there are. I always appreciate the 24 hour coffee/tea station and little convenience store with everything you might need without having to leave the hotel. Rooms are super clean, quiet, and comfy!
We will use this hotel again. Great location. Right off freeway. All places we wanted to go were within 5 miles. Comfy bed. I thought pillows too flat (soft), but still slept well. While we were there it was pretty quiet. Our room faced a hotel that is being dismantled. My husband was awakened once by noise that was from there, but it was only for a few minutes. I wasn't disturbed by it. I would suggest asking for a room that did not face that way, especially if you are a light sleeper. The hotel and our room quite clean. From the reviews I read, I think the hotel is less than 2 years old. They have free wifi. Parking is 16 a day/night. There was plenty of parking. We stayed 8/23-8/26 (Sun-Thurs). During busier weekends or holidays not sure of parking situation or how quiet it would be. The breakfast is fantastic and staff kept all items stocked to 10am when the doors were closed. Many choices. Examples: Scrabbles eggs, sausage links, sausage patties, ham, gravy, biscuits, omelets, home style brkfst potatoes/hash brown dish, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, variety of fruit, muffins, bagels and breads (toast it yourself), make your own waffles, 4-5 different dry cereals, variety of yogurt cups, variety of coffee, tea, oj, apple juice, milk. Variety of jellies, cream cheese, creamers, sweeteners, peanut butter, honey, syrup, butter, margarine, etc. Every day we were there all the hot items were different. The hot egg, meat, potato dishes listed above were not all one day. There were four different items daily of the eggs, meat, and potato dishes. I figured at least 10-15 per person savings if we had to buy breakfast somewhere. All hotel staff very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the Old Town Trolley Tour. Check out all details on line. According to information, the trolley picks up at the hotel. We did not get that early of a start to be picked up at the hotel. Not sure when or where return would be for the trolley. For the times and things we did, it worked out better for us to park at Midway and get on trolley at that location.Dear Pam O,Thank you for your 5-star review. We were thrilled to read that you enjoyed our central location and the great attractions that surround us. Additionally, we graciously appreciate you recognizing our friendly and helpful team. As for your description of your breakfast experience, the only word that comes to mind is wow. Thank you for painting such an amazing picture, our breakfast team was ecstatic. I cannot begin to describe the smiles you brought to their faces when they read your review thank you very much for making their day that much better!Last, but certainly not least, thank you for leaving a traveler tip. While we work to create world class experiences every day for our loyal guests, nobody lives the experience quite like you, our guests. Thank you for helping us make our future guests stays exceptional!Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
We had a great experience here. For the money, you can't beat Hampton Inn Mission Valley. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast is the best I've had (and I stay at many hotels), and the rooms are clean and modern. The temperature is easy to control, and there were extra blankets in the closet. We got daily housekeeping service and they did a great job. There is a pool and hot tub, as well as a fire pit. The pool is smaller than it appears in the picture, but it was never overly crowded and my sons had a blast playing in it every night. The town is a short Uber ride away. There are two washers and dryers for guest use, but sometimes there is a wait. I would definitely stay again.
The most important thing to us is the cleanliness of the hotel, and especially the room. We did not worry about anything as it was fresh and clean every day. The staff was all friendly at all times of the day. We arrived earlier than our check in time but our room was ready so that was good too.Thank you Dolores for taking the time to review our hotel. Our housekeeping staff takes pride in the cleanliness of each room. We are delighted to see that we've exceeded your expectations that our staff had an opportunity to make a great connection with you! We hope that we'll be your first choice the next time you visit San Diego!!!
Besides Henry, the front desk employees and maid service was above and beyond expectation. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to this part of the U.S. The driving around the area was a bit difficult, however, the front desk took great care of giving excellent directions.Thank you for recognizing our staff's Hamptonality. We're thrilled to share your comments with them and give Henry a spot on for his exceptional service. We hope welcome you back soon!
We chose this particular hotel because we had stayed in it last October '14. This time we brought our entire family to have a week long family celebration of our 50th wedding anniversary. The staff, for the most part, is different. But, even better than last time which was right after the grand opening. I'm telling you. You won't be disappointed. They really are a first class operation, kind, and considerate, especially to us older folks that need special handling.
Nice hotel. Easy check in and clean room. Slight deltas: hotel phone handset was sticky (would have never had touched it but the front desk left a welcome message). Shower water pressure was low. The desk chair was uncomfortable, seat pad was very thin. Sometimes road noise was notable. These minor issues were easily overcome/overlooked.
Was greeted with a courteous staff. The room was clean and quiet. Breakfast was good, although a bit crowded at times. My only issue is the parking fee of 19... way too much! Similar properties less than a mile away did not have a parking fee.
Nice place, but.........21 to park!Wifi would drop out, every 5 minutes. Frustrating.Shower pressure sucked. Really bad.Pillows were pretty flat.Lots of freeway noise.Breakfast on Saturday morning was a zoo. Overcrowded, dirty tables, no one cleaning them, out of juice, out of eggs, pretty much out of everything. Get there early. We went down at 0930.Probably would choose someplace else when returning.
Very Hilton-y. I know what to expect. Good service. Updated rooms. Good amenities. When you travel a lot... consistency is fantastic and unpleasant surprises can be draining. Gold+ members get a great breakfast included. Super convenient to shopping, business and restaurants.
The Hampton Inn (Mission Valley) in San Diego was a great choice for our family weekend getaway. It was close to the freeway as well as the San Diego Zoo, parks, and other attractions. The rooms were clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good - not great, but acceptable.
HI. everything was very nice. free wifi and free breakfast. the parking was not free though. the pool was warm and hot tub. there was not really any view but there was a good restaurant in the area named hunter steak house.Thank you for writing a review of our hotel. We glad to see that you've enjoyed the many amenities we have to offer including complimentary wifi, breakfast buffet, pool/spa/fire-pit. We hope that we'll be your first choice the next time you return to the San Diego area!
Hotel is in a great location for 5he purpose o my trip. Staff was very accommodating. Check in and check ou5 wa extremely easy. Internet work well, food was good, room was clean and quiet. Will stay here again if Im in San Diego
I stayed in this hotel with a group of 50 high school students. The staff was friendly, organized, and made the check-in process super easy, considering the size of my group. The were accommodating to all of our needs, even setting up a section of bus parking for us. The staff was also respectful to my students, which is not always the case. Many times hotels only address the adults, but Robbie took it upon himself to make sure they were comfortable.
If you like King rooms, be prepared not to have a bath. None of their King rooms have baths, only showers. I could not properly wash my hair with a tiny showerhead. Many King rooms have communicating doors to the next room, which are good noise-carriers. With regard to noise: the rooms at the freeway end of the hotel are very noisy, much more so than other hotels we've stayed in on Hotel Circle South. We were living out of our suitcases because of the ridiculous size of the drawers in the room (basically the size of nightstand drawers - see picture). The pool is the size of a large hot-tub. Breakfast had many items but lacked quality: the only good things we found were yoghurt and fresh fruit, cooked food was poor.Hotel staff were helpful and did their best to resolve our issues in a not-so-great hotel. Next San Diego visit: back to the Doubletree.
Everything about this newer hotel was pretty nice. Two big detriments: 14 to park, which is ridiculous for a Hampton Inn. Really!! And the bathroom doors have automatic closers, which is terribly annoying, especially when you have little children with you. When I commented to the front desk clerk on checkout what a hassle this was, she said, Yeah. I know. It's a problem we're trying to work on, but with 182 rooms, it takes a lot to do all of them. I said, Well, you should at least provide a doorstop in the room. Her reply was, Oh, you could have asked for one. We have them here. Well, why on earth isn't there a notice to that effect in the room We could have avoided a lot of misery. Anyway, the staff was very nice. The breakfast was very good. We didn't have an opportunity to use the outdoor/pool area, but it looked very inviting with a nice lounge/conversation area. We'd probably stay here again, but we'd definitely ask for a doorstop if they haven't fixed the doors yet. (And we might try to strike a deal with the restaurant next door to park for less.)Dear Traveler, Thank you for reviewing our hotel. The comments are insightful and helpful for the hotel teams goals to improve the service and guest experience. Please accept our teams sincere apology for the failures in service that resulted in any inconvenience and lack of comfort. We are grateful for the choice you made to be a guest of the hotel. As you know, we are currently working towards a solution that meets both safety standards and guest comfort for the bathroom doors. We will continue striving to provide a hospitality level that exceeds other available lodging choices and hope that you'll give us another opportunity should you return to the San Diego area.
Wonderful staff! Everyone was so nice, as well as helpful. Great location too! I have stayed at this hotel several times, and it's always been a great experience. It was fun to see the hotel decorated for the holidays. Thank you! Dear Guest. I appreciate your positive feedback about our hotel. We do take pride in catering to our guests' needs the best way we can. If you're traveling to our area again soon, don't hesitate to call us.All the best,Jordan MauckFront Office Manager
This hotel is located in old town very close to airport. But San Diego airport and center of the city are very close to each other, so its very convenient. I could stay here with calm condition after my business and go to conversation center within 15 minutes by Uber. Im also very satisfied with courteous staffs.
Great value, nice location. Easy access from San Diego airport, short drive to downtown and convention center area at a more reasonable price. Also enjoyed proximity to old town for restaurants and bars. Great area to stay and a clean, quiet, comfortable hotel.
When we arrived, the exterior of the hotel was very colorful and set the tone for a relaxing stay. Christian and Lyle at the front desk were very welcoming. They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service. The only drawbacks were you had to pay for nightly parking and the computers were very slow and the printer was not working. The rooms were clean and updated.
We stayed from Wednesday to Friday in December 2017. Reservation was made on line. I also had a Friends Family Discount Voucher. Front Desk Rep would not accept it. Stated that the reservation was not made that way Explain Pls Just repeated what was said earlier. The reservations was made correctly with the Corporate Code. All I had to do was present Voucher upon check in Spoke to the Operations Director the next day. She couldn't do it either. And stated you got a good rate anyway I would have gotten a lower rate if they honored it and would have proven that the Corporate programs works. Oh well...Next issue parking fee of 20/night. Other Marriot Hotels waive the fee if you are a Calif. AAA member. Brought it up and was told: we don't do that here Ok, I can accept that. However, parking on property is underground and VERY LIMITED. If you drive in and no spaces, you need to back up all the way out. Had to park on the street both nights (which would have been FREE). Other than that, the room was clean and spacious enough. Closet space was small but adequate for the length of stay. I like the pull out desk/table. The shower soap was smallL. Could not get a good grasp on it. It was not larger than 2 flash drives end-to-end and just a little bit wider. That's it. I kept dropping it. The Bistro/Starbucks in the lobby was not open at 6 AM as posted so no eats if you need to hit the road early...
The Courtyard San Diego Old Town is my new favorite hotel! The location is perfect - within easy walking distance (a few blocks) of the amazing restaurants and shops in Old Town. The front desk staff are very hospitable and eager to assist. The property is beautiful and the decor is true to the area. I enjoyed my stay here tremendously!Jjhoster Thank you so much for taking the time to let us now how your stay was. Glad we were able to wow you and allow us to become your new home away from home. Can't wait to have you back, thanks again!!
Only staying overnight for easy airport access for early morning flight. My business reason is always TJ and this Marriott works for my departures and keeps my rewards points coming. I plan to keep using unless a problem starts happening that cannot be fixed by Marriott management.Greetings Lairdc266,Thank you so much for the review regarding your visit. I am glad to hear that our location is so convenient for your travels to Tijuana. We look forward to seeing you next time!All the best,Jordan MauckFront Office Manager
Our reservations were made the day before we traveled. Arrived around 9:00 at night, staff very friendly and ready to help. Room was clean and ready. There was no iron in the room, staff immediately brought one to the room. Room was cleaned daily, nothing went missing. Hotel is right next to the freeway. The room was quiet and traffic noise wasn't a problem.
Average place , over priced and they charge you to park your car onsite.Stayed in far nicer motels for less .Small rooms. Dirty windows .I would expect more from a larger chain like this. Beds were average , bathrooms small but ok.Dear mrshibariplay,We recognize your time is valuable and appreciate the feedback you have provided us regarding your most recent stay.. Maintaining a fresh atmosphere within our guest rooms and common areas is always a key priority. On behalf of the entire team at Courtyard San Diego Old Town, I sincerely apologize for falling short of not only meeting your expectations, but ours as well. Rest assured, the feedback provided will be shared with the appropriate hotel team to ensure we consistently deliver upon guest expectations. As a valued customer thank you for choosing us to accommodate you during your travels. We hope to see you again whenever your travels bring you back to San Diego!
Overall very nice property with friendly staff and good parking options. Walking distance to Old Town San Diego that has an abundance of restaurant choices, stores, and sites. The hotel is also very close to the airport (less than 5 minutes) and a short drive to numerous nearby attractions.Greetings Cypressman,I appreciate your positive feedback about our hotel. We do take pride in catering to our guests' needs the best way we can. If you're traveling to our area again soon, don't hesitate to call us.All the Best!Jordan MauckFront Office Manager
Very convenient to the airport. Clean rooms. Friendly staff but a bit off on their directions to restaurants in Old Towne. Pizza flyer under the door so someone wondering the halls was not a great feeling. Could use a bit of updating. Had a glass of wine in the lobby area and the service was friendly and entertaining.
The hotel is really nice the restaurants have a great food and the staff is excellent. The location makes it easy to get to anywhere been in downtown San Diego and the area is located with several nice restaurants to choose from . The staff...More
Stayed here for 4 nights in Nov and absolutely loved it! Great rooms, great staff, great location (right in Gas Lamp area), great bar and restaurant. Will definitely stay here again when I'm back in San Diego (soon, hopefully). A lovely place to come back...MoreDear Dean L, Thank you very much for your complimentary review after your recent stay at the Omni San Diego Hotel. We were delighted to learn you enjoyed your visit and would consider returning in the future. I agree that our team of service professionals...More
I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around.
I enjoyed my stay here. This hotel is exactly what you would expect based on the price. The Good great location that is within 10 minutes to all (zoo, seaworld, petco, jolla, beaches), nice pool and hot tub area, ample parking spots (just not after 12 as expected), and reasonable price. The Bad not the most plush bed but exactly what I expected. If you're looking for location + price, this is the place for you
The hotel is nice, the location is good, and the staff has been nice BUT it is infested with little cockroaches and they are every where! It is disgusting! I would recommend spending a little more money for a hotel that won't have you sleeping and going home with nasty bugs! Thank for your recent review. We are happy to you thought the hotel and hotel staff were nice. We appreciate that you have brought this area of concern to our attention. Rest assured, each guestroom is routinely deep cleaned and treated with commercial grade steamers as a preventative measure.

The hotel is located next to a very noisy highway. The bathroom was very dirty and the room cooling/heating unit was very noisy. I was not made aware that there was a breakfast included so I could at least enjoy something from this hotel. I checked out after the first night of a 2 night stay and went to the Hilton Bayfront for almost the same money and a MUCH BETTER experience.Dear Bernard B,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we appreciate your feedback. We are sorry you had some noise issues and concerns with your room and if you had let the front desk know, we would have done our best to move you to a more quiet room and address your concerns. Our on-site restaurant, Seven Seas Caf serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
the restaurant was overpriced and not very good. The wall of mirrors in the rooms is awkward when you are sharing a room with your mother, although I think it would have been weird if it had been my husband and I too. The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room, for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or, because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room, which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp, and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working. I will be letting the Marine admins that recommend this hotel to visiting families about this stay.
We arrived at this hotel a little early for check in so we went to get some essentials from the supermarket. We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone.
We stayed overnight in San Diego on our roadtrip. The Best Western is nice, cleen, there was a huge room with two queen size beds. There was free wifi and a refrigerator. We had a quite room on the ground floor.
I took my almost 13 year old niece to San Diego. We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable. There is a plug issue with two outlets where refrig, blow dryer and coffee maker plug in. It wasn't too much of an issue because we just unplugged the refrig when we briefly needed the other appliances. Mirrors didn't bother us and they do make the room feel larger. Room was very clean, bedding was clean and of fairly good guality. Probably the biggest negative was thin walls and doors that you could not close quietly. So we heard noise above us and we were bolted awake one morning by a neighbor 's slamming door at 6:30am. Plenty of free parking. beautiful grounds, sparkling clean pool, nice jacuzzi and great location. Hotel shuttle driver was very nice and reception crew was always helpful. I also appreciated the free computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes. I would stay at this hotel on another trip to San Diego.
Due to LOSSAN performing track maintenance, I wound up spending a few days in San Diego. When I saw the rate, I grabbed it because, honestly, I was curious.What really makes this hotel good is the staff. That goes double with the staff at the restaurant who really stood out and made the place great.The room was good, but not great. It did, however get the job done and I was well rested and got some work done. Under the right circumstances, I would stay again.Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego and for being our guest! We truly appreciate your kind words in regards to your recent stay at our hotel. We will be sharing your nice comments with our Staff members. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego!
I chose this hotel because it was close to the venue where I went to a concert, and I thought a Best Western would be nice. It was not worth the price I paid. Besides not providing breakfast or a discount coupon for breakfast at the adjoining restaurant, the room was small, the towels felt like sandpaper, and the list of television stations was incomplete.
I have had the pleasure to stay here on business and with my family on our weekend getaways! As always, the staff are professional, polite and very helpful to ensure my/our stay is the best possible. I am scheduled to return at the end of the month,.Thank you for being our guest and continually choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your hotel accommodations in San Diego. We are honored to hear you always enjoy your stays with us whether its for business or leisure. We are also extremely pleased to hear that our staff goes above and beyond to ensure you stays with us are great. We cant wait to welcome you back. Thank you!
Stayed at the Seven Seas for three nights en route to Los Angeles and San Francisco, yes it could do with updating but you get what you pay for. Hotels near to the city centre are much more expensive and it only cost 9 dollars in an uber to the harbour plus the bus terminus is only ten minutes walk with frequent travel to the centre. Our stay was comfortable and the staff helpful and polite, no problems with the room It was clean and roomy and you also have free on site parking which is a bonus. A couple of small swimming pools if you would like a relaxing dip and well kept gardens throughout the location. On site restaurant and bar which we didn't use as we were out early and back late. Easy to find just off the freeway would definitely stay again when visiting the area.
I was pleasantly surprised and how nice the property is with a nice jungle type of setting for the landscaping. Very lush/green areas and the rooms are very comfortable and basic. It's a good value if you book early enough to get a good deal for this pretty place. They also have a good cafe/restaurant next door you can have... More
Although the Best Western is aesthetically pleasing upon arrival, the staff in the main lobby are less than hospitable. Even though the hotel has Wi-Fi, the staff did not go out of their way to offer the code to me at check-in. The room was impeccably clean and attractive. However, the bed was not very comfortable to sleep on.
I had a three day seminar, down the road, under the bridge and across the street. It was a pleasure to spend half the money and still be in walking distance of the seminar. The room was small but definitely workable. The grounds were beautiful and it was a pleasure to walk through there every morning and each evening. The staff were cheerful and helpful.
The Best Western Seven Seas was very convenient, easy on and off freeway access. It is only a short distance to the airport parking. We had pre-paid for our room and upon arrival found out that our room had been up graded at no additional charge. Had a king size bed with a balcony and had only paid for queen size bed. pleasant surprise.
This Hotel does not give you a welcoming feel, the staff is not friendly the rooms smell, beds are not comfortable. I stayed in a BW in North Hollywood the same week and it had breakfast and did not smell very nice. Thank you for your review regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, we would like to apologize for not exceeding with your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and Staff for specific training purposes, as guest satisfaction and meeting their expectations are quite important to us. We hope that you will consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Thank you!
we checked in around 8pm room air conditioner was not turned on room had an odor ref was unplugged we had to figure out where the socket was cant dry your hair and keep ref plugged at the same time no microwave in room or convenient place to use it in lobby
We were thrilled to find availability at this hotel, as we booked it the week before our trip. Most hotels were sold out in the area, so we were pleasantly surprised to find comfortable, clean, and hospitable accommodations. We loved the location, which was within a couple miles of Old Town San Diego. If we ever need to return, I will definitely book this hotel.October, 30. 2015Dear Maria Elena We thank you for choosing Best Western Seven Seas for your recent hotel accommodations. We are delighted to know we met your expectations at a busy time of year and that you enjoyed staying in our clean, comfortable guestrooms. We thank you for your feedback, guest satisfaction is always important to us. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego here at the Best Western Seven Seas.Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
This is a 1960's era resort motel, a bit out dated but comfortable and reasonably priced, convenient and with free parking. The old in room air conditioner did it's best, still struggling along as it continues to age. Front desk service was just average. TV reception was minimal we did need to have maintenance come in to get it connected. In room coffee tea is absolute minimum.
We were 4 women in a room with two double beds, in town for 4 days for a convention at the Town Country, happening just on the other side of the I-8 freeway. I'd say mostly positives for us! The property was obviously being attended to while we there, with gardeners replanting and pruning the day we were leaving, the exterior building was being washed down. Very nice plantings all about. Cafe, very satisfactory. Free parking very welcome. Our convention was only a 5 or so minute walk away. We were anticipating free breakfast with the reservation (was discussed when reservation was placed) but because we didn't have documentation of that, we weren't able to counter the front desk assertion that we did not have breakfast with the reservation. So be prepared with your paperwork. Just about once a day, 1 or more of us had our room key cards not work, so we had to go to the front desk to have them reset somewhat tiresome especially because we were housed in the furthest bank of rooms from the office. For the room, yes per other reviews, the a/c is set up such that it's an uneven situation, especially at night when sleeping. We dealt with it. Some sort of problem with shower pipes in the room above, when at 3 and 4 in the morning (!), a loud rattling pipes noise commenced, for a good 10 minutes. We alerted the front desk to the problem in the morning. The noise did not occur the next evening, but it could have been because then there was no one in the room upstairs afterwards during the span of our stay. Sure parking was very tight on the Saturday evening, but it was Saturday night, late we did eventually find a spot.Frig worked well. Plenty of towels. Room didn't at all seem overly dated. Beds were satisfactory. We indulged in the pool one late afternoon, but it ended up being the same time as what appeared to be a family reunion so shifted after a little bit to one of the hot tubs. Very nice nonetheless to have a pool and 2 hot tub options on the property. There is also a small gym facility adjacent to the pool.We would stay here again!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We welcome all guest comments especally when they are so well thought out. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is great knowing you enjoyed our convenient location and that it met your conference needs. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit whether for business or pleasure! Thank you again.
Don't believe this is a 3+ star property. While the room was clean enough, the entire facility is in need of a complete renovation.We were very disappointed as we had a week reservation.My first clue that this was going to be sub-Best Western standards was the fact that their airport shuttle was unavailable for when we were arriving.I will say the hot tub was certainly hot enough and other than the foam that was created when the jets were on(add some more soda ash), was very nice.I am glad we really only slept here as we were about town for most of our stay.Dear Brian: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your candid feedback. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. Exciting things are yet to come, as we are currently undergoing a 2 million renovation, which includes our onsite restaurant Seven Seas Caf, and our infamous Zacks Bar. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are important to us, so we are disappointed not to have met with yours. Our complimentary shuttle service has always been offered based on availability, however, this service has since been discontinued. Please accept our apologies for not having this service available for you. It is our hope that you will consider staying with us again, so we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
I have come to except a certain level of Respect and Professionalism with Best Western Properties, but this one falls below the mark, they have no respect for their Diamond Level customers, the food at the Restaurant is over Priced for what you receive. There is no free or Discounted Breakfast, and no real incentive to eat Lunch or Dinner on property. the Internet works great, Beautiful Property and Housekeeping staff are very nice and courteous.Thank you for the review regarding your recent stay. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed our beautiful property and our nice and courteous housekeeping staff. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. Best Western member properties which do not have on-site full service restaurants are required to provide a complimentary breakfast buffet on-site. Although, we do not offer a complimentary breakfast, our on-site restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, is open from 6am-10pm serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner for our guests convenience. For our hotel guests, we do offer a 15 off on lunch and dinner in our cafe. We hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience.
My friend and I have stayed here twice on two different trips to the San Diego area. It is close to downtown San Diego and Ocean Beach which is important to me. We eat over in Ocean Beach but see theatre shows in San Diego. They did not have any 2 Queen bed rooms available upon check in this past visit but upgraded us for free to a King size bed which worked out perfectly. The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel. Next trip down to San Diego for another theatre show we will be staying here again. Can't recommend this place enough! It's easy freeway access off/on the 8 along hotel row.Dear Jeannette:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your recent hotel accommodations and for being our guest! We are glad you enjoyed our convenient and freeway accessible location, which is close to all San Diego has to offer. It is also great knowing you appreciated our complimentary parking and clean guestrooms. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, and we are delighted we met with yours! It was our pleasure to provide a great experience and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next theatre trip down to San Diego! Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
we stayed here for 4 nights and loved the free wifi, good coverage for TV - tiny tiny bathroom with the sink outside of the bathroom which works well for us, no closet doors there was a fridge in the room and a coffee pot -lots of drawer space, a restaurant and bar on site and free parking - located in hotel circle amongst lots of other hotels -- not really walking distance to anything of interest but easy driving to a huge mall -- one odd thing is that there are two stairs to get to the ground floor rooms from the handicap parking space - good value - very clean - took ages to check in and out - they have all the info they can use before you get there why dont they use it Breakfast was not included in our rate so ask - you may save a ton of money by going elsewhere to eatDear Guest,Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your San Diego accommodations and for sharing your experience. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our free Wi-Fi service, along with the cleanliness of our hotel, free parking, and onsite restaurant and bar. We apologize that the check in process was slower than expected and that breakfast was not included, but we are glad you enjoyed our many amenities. We hope that you will stay with us again soon to experience the many great elements of our hotel. Many thanks again for your time and review.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
it was my last hotel in serious of three during 11 day trip from san francisco so i can compare to few others. the room itself was OK. 2 twin beds that were a little bit small but no surprise there. the bath was fine but the weird thing is that the sink and counter space is outside the bathroom. another weird thing is a full mirror wall on the side of the bed...the walls are very very thin. i felt like the people in the room next door were talking to me. luckily we weren't in the room most of the time but still... the hotel is an open motel kind of space which is nice and has a warm pool at night with steaming water so that's fun. the location at hotel circle is great. close to a lot of things in san diego and i don't think we drove over 1-2 exits in the highway to any of the other attractions. just across the road is the fashion valley mall with a lot of stores and good restaurants if you need to rest.
Wanted a cheap but clean place to stay, and this place worked just fine. They have a free shuttle service which was great. The rooms were cleaner than I expected for the low price I paid, so I was happy about that. However, they could stand to replace their bathroom doors as they are old! The pool and property were nice as well. Staff was friendly. Would stay here again, especially with their great prices.
For the price, around 70 a night, it was average. The room had been somewhat remodeled with new bedding, wallpaper, furniture and drapes. The rooms are very small and tight with two beds. Note that two beds will most likely be 2 doubles, not queens. The bathroom needed work, It wasn't the cleanest. Old door and moldy corners. The grounds of the motel are very nice. However, keep in mind that many temporary workers and hotel help obviously live in the motel. Ask for an upstairs room, the lower rooms are loud. And stay away from rooms across from the laundry. It has a nice pool and hot tubs. The staff was friendly. It is easy access from Interstate 8 and close to the Trolly Stop and Fashion Valley Mall.Dear Traveler, Thank you for your comments regarding your most recent stay with us. We apologize that our property did not live up to your expectations. In regards to the hotel help, our employees are not allowed to stay at the property, but we do have regular guests who work in construction as well as government contractors who work at the Naval shipyards. It pleases us that you enjoyed our convenient property and the friendliness of our staff, and hope that you will reconsider staying with us in the future. Kind Regards,Joe ToczylowskiGeneral ManagerBest Western Seven Seas
Amazing it was the very best I could have stayed or do business in at San Diego. I am most impress as I don't really stay at a lot of great hotels like the best Western. First la jolla, next Mission Valley. I'm sure I'll be staying here again. and in different locations.Dear Floyd: Thank you for providing us with feedback on your recent stay. The Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego is grateful for your kind remarks and glad that you enjoyed the value received. We thank you for choosing us for your hotel accommodations and look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip whether for business or pleasure!Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
Our stay was very nice. The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable. The grounds were clean and nice with all the green plants. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again. Also very close to Old Town and out attractions.Thank you for taking the time to review your hotel experience. We are so happy you enjoyed your stay. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to San Diego. Thanks again!
This was a terrible experience our room had nats and spiders in it. It smelled and the Air conditioned was filthy and did not work. It was disgusting and in need of renovation. I needed a new room and they did not want to accommodate me wanted to send maintenance, No way I already was late for our tour. After about 40 minutes they sent the manager who was absent every time I asked for him. And of course no one could help except him. He finally offered a new old room that smelled but the ac work. We had to move and of course had no time to get ready for our 515 tour. I will be contacting the hotel management to discuss this overpriced horrible experience not the local manager he never called me he didn't like me much after I told the folks checking in check their rooms for bugs!Thank you for your recent review. On behalf of our entire team, we would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. We appreciate that you have brought this area of concern to our attention. Rest assured, each guestroom is routinely deep cleaned and treated with commercial grade steamers as a preventative measure. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is our hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can provide you with a superior experience. Thank you.
Made reservations at the last minute for New Year's eve and it was clearly 20 cheaper for similar hotels in the area. Clean, digital tv. Older style heater/air-conditioner combination controlled by a high/low thermostat rather than temp. It worked fine. Even though next to the freeway, didn't hear a thing in the room.
Overall the experience was good. I would stay there again. The grounds are beauitiful, I will stay there again in June 2015. Great resturants close by and good access to other interesting attractions.Dear LeRoy W.:We appreciate your feedback and kind comments. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and being our guest! We are glad that you and your family enjoyed our beautifully landscaped property. It will be our pleasure to share your comments with our landscape maintenance team. As you know, the Best Western Seven Seas is conveniently located to all San Diego has to offer. In addition to our own great onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, there are other excellent restaurants close by. We look forward to welcoming you back in June! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
It was cheap. It was clean. It was nice. Good restaurants nearby. Seaworld, zoo, and whole lot of beaches no less than 15 min away from hotel. Cafe wasn't too bad either. Jacuzzi was nice as well. Would stay here again.Thank you for the great review of our hotel. We try to offer as much value as we can. Cafe, Zack's Bar, Pool, 2 Jacuzzis, Fitness room, free WiFi and parking. Add all this to the great location and beautiful grounds, we think it's an excellent value. We hope to see you again very soon.
The girls at the front desk were efficient when we arrived, but by the time we had booked in, the 11 or so behind us didn't look too happy as only 2 girls were there and the queue was growing very fast...Decor throughout the main part of the hotel is dated, but well maintained and clean. The motel style units looked well worn out, but we were pleasantly surprised at the fresh decor and up market linens and drapes in our room, which was spotlessly clean and cleaned every day we stayed there.The pool and spa pools are beautiful. I didn't use the fitness room as looked a bit 'testosterone laden' with too many men working out for me, but the pool was clean and warm.It's in a strange situation on 'the Hotel Circle' which literally is a circular route of hotels with an elevated highway running alongside them, about 3-4 miles from downtown, so there is a bit of traffic noise, but Downtown hotels are ALL on the flight path of either the Navy airstrip or the international airport! If you are a light sleeper, ask for rooms in the 210-224's as these are quietest and not poolside either. We slept okay.
The property is very clean including the rooms. You can't beat the location to many attractions like Balboa Park, Sea World, the beaches, and airport. The gym is a bit small and the walls to the rooms are paper thin.
There were some areas great and some were not. We still enjoy the most of them. The location of the hotel was great and very easy access to all amenities. Our best overall service that we were enjoying most was the shuttle drivers. They were very helpful and care a lot to all areas of the service. We all recommended them the best. The second area we enjoyed as well was the dinning in area especially outside. The coffee was great we love it the most too. The service there was great too. Our rooms were good just not much space to move from one end to another but other than that it was okay. The only two areas that we weren't enjoying at all was at the reception area just one receptionist that was very helpful, her attitude was too good at all, she never smile and not helpful too. The other area that we weren't enjoyed was around the all rooms the smoking cannabis it was horrible and very bad, outside where we were staying when open the door we couldn't breath because of the horrible smell as well as people have no respect to other people around.
hotel has a fresh coat of paint since the last visit. pool area nice. great beds. small bathrooms and the faucet puts out just as much water as shower head when shower is on. very friendly staff. restaurant and bar aren't too bad. good location.
Location was great, hotel circle. Very close to everything. Room a little small. Would get up to use restroom in the middle of the night and kept running into the chair. Just my husband and I. Daughter and her husband and three kids in another rooom. Air conditioning didn't work very well in either room..
We needed a hotel with airport transportation arriving rather late in the evening, and this came up online. The bus took awhile to pick us up but the driver was very pleasant and took my husband back to pick up our rental car next morning, and to the airport for a very early flight after our second stay Sunday night. The hotel grounds were attractive, room adequate and breakfast very good, with a discount. Would use it again for a before or after flight motel at half the airport hotel price.
Gnats in room, I had bites all over my body and due to spraying of raid had a severe chemical reaction to my lungs. The walk ways should have been posted slippery due to sprinkler, someone could have had a serious fall. Table by pool area filthy. Mgr Scott was rude regarding my situation!!!! Will not recommend!!!! Food prices in hotel very high.
I enjoyed one of the two hot tubs being open late. The cute theme and color coordinated dcor inside and outside of the buildings put me into relaxation mode. The diner on site is convenient. I slept comfortably in the bed. It was over all a quite restful environment.
First of all I want to say this was a good trip but not because of the MOTEL. We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest,We are happy to hear that you had a good trip to San Diego, but we are sorry that the Best Western Seven Seas did not meet your expectations. Our rooms are often booked months in advance, especially for the summer, and unfortunately we cannot always provide last minute bookings with a specific room type. We are in the process now of updating and upgrading our bedding package which includes mattresses. As for the late night disturbance, we apologize that you were not happy with the way the situation was handled. Guest disturbances should be handled in a very sensitive manner, and we have discussed the management of the issue during your stay with our team leaders and their staff. We are always looking for ways to improve and take your comments seriously. It is the mission of our company to see that each of our guests receives an excellent service experience and we are sorry that your stay did not turn out that way. We thank you for staying with us, and for your valuable input to how we can run our business better. Kind Regards and Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
While looking for affordable accommodations in this area, I kept finding places that charged extra for parking, which is something that just rubs me the wrong way. Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.Thank you for being our guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and taking the time to review our property, we really appreciate your feedback. Hopefully we'll welcome you back soon on your next trip to San Diego.
The rooms were as expected from a Best Western. Nothing special, but very clean. The grounds were very well kept and had beautiful plants that it felt very tropical. Parking was near the room so very convienient, but like a motel experience where the cars are all pulled up in front of the room doors. We enjoyed our visit.
I have used Best Western for business and pleasure trips. I appreciate the amenities even though the quality seems to vary depending on location. The staff have consistently tried to accommodate my needs and random dietary requests and I have appreciated the genuine desire to help my stay at BW be as comfortable as possible.
The Best Western Seven Seas is a great place to stay in San Diego. There is a nice pool and spa. My son likes that there is a restaurant on the property and room service. This hotel is conveniently looked to all the sites of San Diego and a great shopping center!
Was pleased with room, it was clean, bed comfortable. The convenience of having on site restaurant was a plus. Food was good and prices reasonable. Wish i had time to enjoy pool and jacuzzi. Convenient location. Thank you for your kind remarks in regards to your recent stay and for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas! We are happy to hear you enjoyed our clean, comfortable rooms, the food in our onsite restaurant and our convenient location. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to San Diego, thank you.
First time guest at this very pleasant hotel. Grounds are well manicured and nicely layed out. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with a trendy decor. Bathrooms a little dated, but very clean. I usually stay at BW Plus hotels, but this property offered all the amenties I've received in the Plus hotels in a great location for my business trip at an attractive rate. Close to mall, restaurants Quallcom Stadium. Close enough to the airport, without the airport noise. Multiple 2 story walk up buildings. Recommend rooms on the first floor, although car lights could shine into the room if your drapes are open. Staff was friendly, courteous and very professional.
This is a GREAT Hotel! I found this reasonably priced hotel and was very satisfied with my stay. I'm a tough customer. Fair but tough. The rooms are clean. Beds were comfortable. Newly renovated Restaurant and Pool. Parking is good. The grounds are tropical and well kept. The only thing I would want is a renovated bathroom in the rooms. A simple upgrade of tile and new countertops and fixtures would make this property even better. I will definitely stay here when I am in town again.Thank you nso much for the great review. Sounds like you were able to take advantage of all we have to offer. We can't wait to see you the next time you're in San Diego. Thanks again.
This hotel is close to everything shopping ---beaches--zoo-- Balboa Park and only thirty minutes from Legoland. The beds were comfortable and the pool was warm along with two hot tubs one just for adults another where the pool is located.They also had a restaurant and a choice to buy discounted tickets for attractions.also they had Washers and dryers for those wet sandy clothes from the beach.. Thanks would stay here again.
Awful hotel. Low quality for the price. Service was horrible, good luck trying to contact a manager to help solve really simple problems with your stay. The room I stayed in has terrible ventilation and low quality bed, sheets, towels, etc. I am most peeved by the service and wish I could say I had a better experience.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. We welcome all guest comments because they let us know what we are doing well and where we can improve. Thanks again.
Smallish room, clean, comfy bed, no cheesy bedspreads, nice pillows, decent bathroom, coffee maker, easy access from car to room, full on restaurant, pool, hot tub. Friendly fast experience front desk check in. Affordable, clean remote. Will stay here again. Dog friendly too!
Spent a couple of nights here during our stay in San Diego. The hotel is well located near attractions and shopping and easily accessible to highways. It is not a new facility but it appears to be cared for. Beautiful grounds with a nice pool area and two hot tubs. Very helpful staff and a clean facility. We were pleased with our stay.Dear Kat F.: Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations and for being our guest! We are delighted to hear that you appreciated our convenient location, which is close and accessible to all San Diego has to offer. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is nice to know you also enjoyed our beautifully landscaped grounds, our nice pool area, and hot tubs. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, so it will be our pleasure to share your kind remarks to our entire staff. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to welcoming you back, so you and your family may enjoy another nice stay in San Diego! Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
This hotel was clean and easy to access after a long day of driving and playing softball. It was in a kind of run down area and the hotel is somewhat outdated but we were just looking for somewhere clean to sleep. For that reason it was great. The staff was wonderful and very polite with all directions and requested information and help.
stayed here on 3/4/21012free parking, good free wy fi. good location to rental cars and airport.not during rush hour.the queen bed was the worst ever, cold shower, and hair drier did not work at 430 am.manager adjusted the bill. room was clean park in front of room.
Just what you paid for, its a clean hotel. It has enough parking lot for everyone. And its close from most of the important stuff in San Diego. The rooms are not big , but enough to hold a small family
Not bad for hotel circle slightly out dated but clean the restaurant isn't terrible either I guess hot tub is open 24 hours a day pretty grounds slightly inconvenient location however absolutely must have a car
Close to all we wanted to see and the hotel give you a little list of direction to things that is incredibly helpful. Nothing fancy but felt comfortable. Shower pressure not great and limited hot water.
Perfect location with easy access to all of San Diego and free shuttle. Surrounded by palm trees, great hot tubs and pool, friendly, accommodating staff, excellent food, Zack's bar is cozy and fun, room is comfortable with everything you need.Dear Christopher E.,Thank you for your nice comments regarding your recent stay! We're thrilled that you found our hotel to be the perfect place to stay when visiting San Diego. We're glad you enjoyed our complimentary shuttle service as well as our friendly and accommodating staff and our many amenities including our pool and hot tubs. We're also happy to hear that you were pleased with your experience at our onsite restaurant, the Seven Seas Cafe, and our cozy Zack's Bar. Thank you for mentioning our comfortable and well-appointed rooms. We hope to see you again on your next trip to San Diego! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
A chain Hotel but never the less good value for money with large rooms, quiet ambience, a good pool, restaurant and polite staff. Close to the freeways in San Diego's Hotel circle, the Hotel is easily accessible, it's close to the Fashion Valley shopping Mall, it's on the Downtown Trolley route and although it gets busy, it's never overcrowded. A good value for money Hotel away from the busy beach areas. The Restaurant is good value too.Dear Leonard P.:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your hotel accommodations! We appreciate your nice comments in regard to our large guestrooms, quiet ambiance, good pool, our onsite restaurant-Seven Seas Caf, and polite staff. Our property, as you know, is conveniently located and easily accessible. We are also glad that you appreciated and enjoyed the good value of both our guestrooms and restaurant. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are important to us, so we are happy we met with yours.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
We stayed here for a few days in November. All three rooms were nothing less than spectacular. Our rate was awesome through PRICELINE and was under 40.00. The facilities are spotless and the location is super... the crossroads of San Diego... two malls just 2 miles away, great cuisine up the hill and access to the pool and whirlpools were also great.Free parking and everyone we encountered was very nice.We'd pay a little more to stay there again.
This hotel is located such that it's fairly easy to get to most parts of San Diego. The hotel is a little older, but it is kept up well. Food at the diner is a little on the expensive side (NO CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST!!), but the staff are friendly. The room we were in was clean and wasn't too noisy.Thank you for the nice review and for being our guest. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our convenient location located close to all the attractions in San Diego. Hopefully well welcome eyou back real soon. Thank you!
It comes down to this: as usual, you get what you pay for. The hotel is older, but at least it is clean.Pros: price, location (close to everything but not too close), friendly staff, clean rooms.Cons: small rooms, doesn't feel terribly secure, noisy (thin walls), no breakfast, hard beds.
The place was good, but upon checkout I was told they would apply my 40.00 gift card plus an email of my check out. Neither happened. The location is central and the room is good. We had a patio. The staff was not very helpful. The location is on hotel row with 20 other hotels you could chose from. You might try Hampton Inn or one of the others. It is right by the freeway.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. On behalf of our entire team we would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and Staff for specific training purposes, as guest satisfaction and meeting their expectations are extremely important to us. We are however happy to inform you that we have redeemed your gift card and refunded your card, we sent a receipt to your email hopefully you received it. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience and we hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Thank you!
Very nice room, clean and well taken care of. The grounds were very well taken care of with beautiful tropical flowers and palm trees. It was our third stay in 3 years and were again very happy. The heated pool and two hot tubs were awesome.
This hotel is not as it once was when I started visiting it. The staff is still friendly and professional, however it stops there. The rooms are out dated. The internet is intermittent they only provide wireless service. The water pressure is low and it only ever reached luke warm. At one point it turned ice cold on me. Unfortunately, I will find it hard pressed to go back.Dear John K.: Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations and being our guest! Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, so we are delighted to hear you were met with friendly and professional staff. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests.

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your candid feedback and we hope you will consider staying with us again in the future. Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
We were very disappointed that while we made a reservation for a lower level room by the time we checked in we were forced to take a stairwell up to the second floor. We specifically asked for a lower level as my mother has bad hips and a hard time climbing stairs. The second floor would have been fine had there been an elevator at least, but there was not which resulted in us hauling her luggage up for her so she wouldn't fall. We were very displeased by this to start with, but what added insult to injury was the extremely rude nature of the check in receptionist.
Warning:. Do not stay here if you have kids or simply don't mind having others watch you in your room through peepholes. Oct 13th to 16th stay. Peephole discovered above light, which is above sink in room 507. Sheriff's Dept. Notified at 830 am next morning. Staff didn't care and in fact smirked as though they didn't believe it. Corporate responded by email to my complaint stating that since credit card company agreed to reverse charges and police had been contacted, they weren't going to pursue matter, implying somehow that I shouldn't have told in them. Absolutely gross! You have been warned! Stay at own risk! I will update further once the police investigation has completed. Check out the pics of the room, 507. Attached.We are sorry to hear that your recent stay with us did not exceed your expectations. We appreciate your feedback and will use it to make improvements to offer guests a better experience in the future. We hope you will give us another chance and stay with us again. -Best Western Hotels Resorts
I stayed here for 2 days and it was a nice place to stay. The room offered a mini fridge and coffee pot. The room was small but it was only me and I was there just for sleeping. The room was neat and clean when I arrived and while I stayed. I had a ways to walk to get to my room and it was dark so the map that they gave me didn't help much. The air conditioner was a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper it will bother you if you run it at night. The window does open but it is on the walkway side of the room. There are two hot tubs on the property and a pool. I ate at the cafe on the property and it was very good. They DO NOT offer airport transportation but I got and Uber for about 4.
Not what we were expecting from a Best Western. Stayed here with my family of 4 because it was near the zoo and was expecting better from a Best Western. Room with 2 double beds was extremely small, hotel was quite dated and we felt uncomfortable. Thought we could get a roll-away bed with our room but they said it would not fit, They were correctm we could barely move in this tiny, tiny room! Will not stay here again.Dear levine331: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. We are currently undergoing a 2 million renovation, so exciting things are yet to come. Based on hotel occupancy, larger guestrooms are available, so we apologize if you felt our guestrooms were too small. Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations in San Diego and hope you will consider staying with us again, so we may have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
Don't let the Priceline or Hotwire star rating fool you. This is NOT a 3 star hotel. This is an older hotel with wear and tear that makes this more of a 2 star hotel. The last time this place was renovated was (I'm guessing) more than 10 years ago. Tell me, how clean do you expect 10 year old carpet to be The lack of an in-room microwave and no poolside towels are two notable deficiencies. Most Best Western's provide some sort of a breakfast but this place does not. Having said that, the location in Mission Valley is very convenient and when you factor in free parking and discount pricing (from Hotwire / Priceline)... this place is actually a decent value. A Crown Jewel in the Best Western Empire IT IS NOT... but for a short stay at a convenient place in San Diego with free parking, the discount price may offset some of the limitations.
my name is stephanie me and my boyfrien booked this hotel for 4 days i woke up to a silver fish in my bed in top of my arm this mornin january 6 2012 to my luck on my birthday i have a rash in my leg i found 2 of them ... i understand they are bugs but to find them in my bed thats not goood .. i placed them in a container and walk to the front dest i told the front desk girl and she said it was just like a spider .. are u kidding me i cant belive she just said that im very upset i would understad if i would of found them in the bathroom floor or else were buut no it had to be in my bed :( i reserch them and it falls in the bed bugs list ...... the phone dident work they wount even let u reheat your food .... the dinner food is grosse and expensive not a good place to stay in .Dear Stephanie, We are sorry that you had a bad experience at our hotel, and we have spoken with our front desk staff regarding the circumstances you have provided about your stay with us. We would like to apologize for the service you received at the front desk, as our company believes that each of our guests should experience exceptional service when they stay at one of our hotels. The front desk may not have had a situation that played out as yours did before, but we have spoken with the department on how to handle these things better. We are an older property, and like all houses and buildings, there is occasionally the visit from bugs. We undertake a comprehensive pest control program which includes regular visits from a specialist pest control organization for preventative maintenance. It is important to advise our guests that silverfish are indeed not related to bed bugs. We take bed bugs very seriously, as they are an infestation that can travel and affect guest comfort, however we take all bug visitors seriously since your feedback we have notified housekeeping and our pest control department to monitor the area. Regarding your further comment about reheating your food, unfortunately the San Diego County Health Department will not allow food into our kitchen that does not come from a permitted Food Distributor. We are sorry this was an inconvenience for you. Thank you for staying with us and sharing your comments with us.Kind Regards Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
I don't know how they do it. I own a small lodging facility in Alaska and there's no way I could offer this quality for this price. For an aging property, they have done very well with modest rates to manage the upkeep and maintenance. I walked in to my room this time thinking, I don't remember this higher-quality tile... More
I will start with the major issue. This Best Western has no staff that reads of que. It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again.
Staff was great. Close by so many attractions. FREE parking and FREE WiFi. Rooms are decent for what youre paying. No complimentary breakfast, no acces to a microwave. Other than that it was a great experience, had no trouble at Check out. Thank you for the great review of our property and for being our guest. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our convenient location which is close to all of San Diegos attractions. We are also pleased to hear you took advantage of our free parking and Wi-Fi. We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back on your next visit. Thank you!
The rooms are always clean and comfortable. I love the fact that it is several little buildings motel like but Best Western Style. So you walk out of your room right outside through beautifully manicured greenery that are tropical like and CA style. It is low key yet comfortable. The pool has no chlorine and water doesn't smell awful seems... More
Nice , CLEAN, friendly, nice price. I wish the airconditon is not so loud. :) The BW Seven seas in San Diego is the third of the Best Western hotels that I visited and found that each of them is very clean :).Thanks to those ladies who do their part well. I'll be back BW! :)
Hotel is very nice and accommodating. We arrived two hours early and we were able to get right in our room. The grounds are very nice and clean. We found our room to be comfortable for our needs. It does not have a microwave, but it did have a mini fridge. We would definitely stay here again. The staff was very friendly and always available for questions.
Feel secluded with surrounding lush green plants, palm trees and very friendly staff. Caf dining, cocktail lounge, swimming pool/hot therapy pool, fitness center and room service if needed. What more could you ask for at an afforded rate! Loved it!
On a good note, this place has nice hot water, the AC keeps the room nice and cold, the staff are helpful, room service seemed to be very efficient, the beds are comfortable enough, and the one meal I had here was pretty good.On the flip side, our room had bugs (most likely due to the gaping crack around the door), a lot of the outlets did not work, the tub always looked like it had sand in the bottom, and the carpeting looks like it is in bad need of replacement.Solely based on my experience, I cannot recommend this place to anyone. Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We are however, pleased to hear you enjoyed our comfortable beds as well as our helpful and efficient staff. Hopefully you will consider staying with us again in the future so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Thank you!
I've stayed at this property a few times in San Diego. While the doors do not properly fit and the rooms are not the cleanest it was more out of convenience than anything. Three weeks ago I stayed at this property and they charged me for an extra night. I gave them weeks to respond. I have given the management at this hotel and the accounting weeks to respond but they haven't even tried. I've left emails, voice mails, and one person in accounting said they would get back to me. I have now wasted hours on this issue.Thank you for your review regarding your recent stay at our property. We would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and the Staff for specific training purposes. We invite you to contact us directly to provide us with additional details in order to address your concerns. Thank you.
This is a great location and easy on/off from the highway. The zoo is under 3 miles away and Petco Park is under 5. There are other sights close by as well. If you want to minimize your driving in San Diego and still drive to some vacation spots, this is a great choice. Nice pool. No breakfast included but they have a restaurant. Also many other motels within walking distance that also have restaurants.Dear grb53,Thank you for the nice review! We appreciate your kind comments in regard to our convenient and freeway accessible location. As you mentioned, our hotel is just minutes from some of the premier attractions in San Diego including the Zoo and Petco Park. If you prefer to have breakfast included in your rate, we do offer a breakfast package available for an additional cost. Thank you for choosing our hotel for your San Diego lodging needs and were glad you enjoyed your stay!Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
All in all I like this hotel. I stay here every time I am in San Diego for business. Front desk staff unfriendly . rooms are clean. The pool is nice. I wish they midnight curfew for Jacuzzi but unfortunately the Jacuzzi is 24 hours and people can be loud at times
Beautiful grounds and gardens once you check in you are in Paradise. Welcoming staff from the front desk to the hospitality to the maintenance. Pool area largest in the area you don't feel like you are on top of the other guests.Thank you for such and amazing review and for being our guest. We are delighted to hear that you found our hotel to be a home away from home. We look forward to your next visit to San Diego. Thank you!
This is a frustrating hotel it's OK, but with minimal effort it could be so much better.The basic amenities are fine the room was clean the wifi and TV worked, and the bar was open. All good, rightNo...upon check-in, they add a 75 block to your credit card, and say it'll stay from 5-7 business days. That's outrageous, and when I asked why, was told people steal TV's from the rooms. If so, 75 doesn't cover a replacement (and they should rent to better people!). Short-sighted for them I was going to book another night a few days later, but learned they'd block an additional 75...this is building customer loyaltyOn check-out, a guest was complaining that she had no hot water for 3 days...the front desk clerk's attitude was 'management cut back on maintainance. Lovely. Worse, the morning shuttle I'd booked and they reconfirmed the night before was cancelled as the van driver decided to help a family load suitcases into the van......at which point to desk clerk called me a taxi and had the hotel pay for it - a VERY generous gesture!Like I said, a difficult review to write. I wonder if management knows just how hard it's employees work to keep the customers happy
The rooms are a bit small but the hotel is about ten minutes away from the airport. I like that it was near the North Park area, so its a great location if you are catching a flight out of Lindbergh Field and have a car to get around. Probably not the best place if you want to spend a night partying in San Diego.
I checked in for one night over a July weekend and found the staff at the front desk to be very helpful. The clerk asked me where I'd prefer my room and I asked for somewhere quieter. She was able to put me in a room further away from the pool/stairs which was very great. The room was clean and smoke free as promised. The AC also worked very well. I would recommend earplugs if you go to bed early or want to sleep in, as other guests come back late and leave earlier for the near by attractions. During the night I couldn't hear anything from either neighboring room which was very nice!
I booked site unseen as I am a Best Western Rewards member. This hotel is older than the seven seas! The outside is old and needs maintenance, appearing more like a highway side trucker motel than a hotel. Rooms are old and musty, with water and moisture damage radiating from the bottom of the exterior door and bathroom door. I know it's moist in San Diego, but doesn't necessarily mean the room should smell moldy. Room appeared clean at first glance, but tile floor in shower/toilet area needed scrubbing and vanity looked like it was never dusted. Shower water was luke warm.Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay at our property. We would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities to meet the needs of our guests. Rest assured your concerns are being shared with the appropriate departments in order to be discussed. We hope that you will consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Thank you! -Team BW7S
We checked in here for four nights before moving to our apartment in San Diego, this hotel is in hotel circle, so not many bars and restaurant are around, but its 20 mins walking distance to fashion valley, so if you love shopping, do take advantage of that! The Zacks bar in the hotel has happy hour every day from 4 to 7, we really liked that. Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. We are also pleased to hear you liked the happy hour in our bar. Hopefully well welcome you back for a stay-cation or even just for happy hour. Thank you!
good service over all in the hotel in outside the hotel closed to my conference a walking distance, the restaurant got good service and good food, the room was clean, the parking no problem, and it was no smoking on the room it is excellent
I visited this hotel twice with my family and we all loved it. Easy access on and off the freeway all while being a quiet and safe hotel. The room had upgraded new furnishings and there was a restaurant on site.
This is the first time I have ever been moved to write a hotel review, but this hotel far exceeded my expectations. It is in the same area as a number of other low-budget properties, and I have stayed in several because it is close to my daughter, but from this point forward I will always choose this hotel. The...

Overall great value for the price we paid. Rooms are clean, comfy beds, a little dated but I enjoy the retro look so worked for me!Highlight was definitely the heated pool and hot tub, our kids never wanted to leave...the grounds were beautiful and well kept. We ate at the restaurant 5 times and the food was good, nothing outstanding but hit the spot and service was great.Another bonus was that it was close to the fashion valley mall transit location so we were able to get around and see the sights and beaches with public transit easily and a day pass for adults was only 7. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to families with kids and travelling on a budget!Thank you for the nice comments. We glad you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of many of our amenities. We hope to see you again real soon. Thanks again.
Very clean and close to everything San Diego has to offer.Close to the freeway for access to everything. The restaurant had good food where we dined for breakfast and dinner on a few different occasions, Patrick was our server and was very accommodating and personable . The room was very clean and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. The price was more than reasonable and we will stay there again if we are in the San Diego area.Dear Bradstaaf,Thank you so much for your great comments! We are so happy to hear that you appreciated the cleanliness of our property and rooms as well as the value you received. We are glad that you were pleased with our convenient location with easy access to the freeway and close to all that San Diego has to offer. We are also glad that you liked our Seven Seas Caf for both breakfast and dinner, and that Patrick took care of your needs in a personable manner. We will be more than happy to pass the kind words on to him! Thank you again for taking the time to review the Best Western Seven Seas and we welcome the opportunity to be of service to you during your next visit to San Diego. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
The grounds are really pretty, the rooms are very nice and clean. The staff is very nice. The WiFi did not work well in my room. My room was in the 200 building around the back and it was very quiet. I was very impressed about the charges incurred if you smoke in the room- that is a great way to keep all rooms smoke free! The bathroom was very small. One thing I did not like was all the smoking at the pool- I ended up not going to the pool because of the number of people smoking. I also was disappointed that the hotel does not offer a free breakfast.
I checked out and moved to another Best Western in town right after I checked in to this hotel. Checking in experience was very bad, desk clerk was poorly trained. I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!Dear Sally C.,Thank you for your review, we appreciate your valuable feedback. We've read through your review in detail and are sorry to hear of the service and room cleanliness issues you experienced. It is our top priority to ensure each guest has an exceptional stay and it appears we fell short of this goal during your visit. Rest assured, we will discuss your concerns with our staff to prevent these issues from reoccurring for future guests. Thank you again for your review. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
I am being nice rating this place average, this hotel is stuck in the 70s as far as decor, the room noise from room to room is bad, everytime your neighbor open and closed thier door it felt like they were in your room, not good.
great staff-heated pool-comfy bed-clean room and great location-disappointed with the wifi but otherwise it was very nice. There is a bar and a caf onsite-very convenient. Close to nearby attractionsThank you for being our guest and for your recent review. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed our great staff and our convenient location close to everything San Diego has to offer. We look forward to having you on your next visit to San Diego. Thank you!
Everything was excellent will definitely be going back soon the quality was great and the staff were very helpful and made everything easy for my family and I as soon as we got there they were very friendly and professional.Thank you for taking the time to write such a great review.

Stayed several nights in June 2012. (Check several sites on the Internet for the best rates under 100 a night. Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small, but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable, but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills, elipticals, and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout, ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall, Old Town, and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times, particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby, but there are also cheaper fast food places.
I stayed here for one night in a single queen room. The room was very small and dated. The worst part of this property is how thin the walls are. You can hear every conversation that your neighbors are having as well as anytime the toilet is flushed, shower is on, door is open/closed etc. If you are only looking for a cheap place to stay this may suit your needs but there are many better options in hotel circle (even for the same price).
We moved to this hotel from two doors down and were extremely pleased. The rooms have been renovated in the past 2 months and were clean and fresh, albeit small. I recommend buildings 1,2, or 3. The grounds were lovely and calming and the pool was clean. Downsides: No continental breakfast, slow internet connection, a microwave didn't come with our room and the shuttle times weren't great for young children. Also, the TV channels were extremely limited, and there's no DVD player, but you can pay for Disney shows or Curious George at 4 each episode. We walked over to Bunz for food which was better than the restaurant. Great location, close to everything, but you need a car.
The grounds are dimly lit at night and it is hard to find your room at night. The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see. Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card. Overall the grounds were well kept and the room was clean, but had poor appliance, electrical outlet and furniture placement. No elevator for 2nd floor rooms.
We have now stayed here three times and really like this place. While it is not on the water, it is close to the Pacific and most other attractions in San Diego. The staff are well trained and friendly and we actually are offered upgrades due to our BW Ride Rewards status. This does not happen at most BW hotels. The rooms are nice but a bit dated. We love the property since it really seems like a tropical resort. We come to San Diego quite often and will certainly make the BW Seven Seas our property of choice.Dear PaulSchm,Thank you for being a loyal guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and for taking the time to write your wonderful review. We are happy to hear that you were satisfied with our friendly staff and our convenient location. We are currently going through numerous renovations throughout the hotel, including granite counter tops for the bathrooms, wood cabinetry, and upgrading various amenities. Thanks again for your time and we look forward to accommodating you again soon!Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
My husband and I drove into SDiego after a 7 1/2 hour drive. (Avoid Hwy 5 if you're coming in from up north. Tons of roadwork). Anyway, the staff was friendly and quick to serve us. It was 2am so there wasn't a line. But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card. So I stayed here to earn points. But, note to self: won't be staying here for an extended stay. Can't say I'd recommend it to others.
Convenient to many different places to go. Shopping, airport, Beaches, Museums, Eateries, Everything ! The staff is very helpful, Zaks Bar is a fun place to sit and un-wind, The PG Lounge is seperate from the restaurant and you can sit out by the pool and lounge outside as well. They open up the large BBQ for guests, poolside, for fun. It's an older establishment, but they keep it up, and it's just right for the budget -oriented person, or, family ,when taking those trips to the amusement parks. Pretty close to everything. Centrally located !Dear Thomas M M:Thank you for being our guest and providing us with your feedback. We appreciate all your great comments in regard to our centrally and conveniently located property. As you know, the Best Western Seven Seas is close to all San Diego has to offer. We were pleased to hear you enjoyed our very helpful staff including those in our infamous Zacks Bar. Our property is older however, we are continually upgrading both inside and out in order to meet the needs of our guests. We are also glad that you were thankful for the value you received while staying here. Thank you for choosing us for your hotel accommodations and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip whether for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
This is a wonderful hotel, a real tropical paradise in Mission Valley. The staff are very attentive and work to accommodate you. The rooms are nice with everything you need. I will always stay here when visiting San Diego!
Wasnt used to this but ok. Will check account to make sure it drops off when you leave. Clean and pretty quiet. The restaurant made a special pizza for me that was tasty. Hotel is near Sea World and good for families.
I stayed at this motel from 7/11 - 7/16 2012 for Comic-Con. I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location.
This hotel is not on or close to the strip but perfect if you are in Las Vegas to golf or sight see. We were not interested in being close to the strip and this hotel was perfect. It was clean and relatively new. The rooms were nice with new decor and the breakfast was good with enough selection for our needs. I would stay here again if we found ourselves in the area
Older hotel but very comfortable and a great staff, very helpful to any of your needs. Internet worked with no slow downs and the pool was inviting. The fitness roomwas great. I stayed there ten years ago and many of the same helpful staff are still working there.
Great location. Was close to downtown Sam Diego and had numerous shops and restaurants nearby. Room was clean and comfortable. Only negative was that we needed to use the laundry facilities and they were perpetually busy during the evening. What should have taken 1 hour took much longer as we had to wait for machines. Management should consider extwnding this facility.
The room was ok. I stayed there from Friday to Monday. We couldn't even get a late check out. Check out was at 12. And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations and would be happy to host your next visit to San Diego and provide you with an excellent stay given the chance. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
