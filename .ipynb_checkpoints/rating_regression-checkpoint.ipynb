       "      <td>I stayed with a friend at the Freehand for two nights in a queen bed private room. The room was quiet and clean, but very small. My friend and I were climbing over each other and our suitcases to move around the room. One thing that ruined the room for us was the lack of control over the temperature of the room. The weather in Chicago that week was in the mid-upper 60s, but the room was WARM. There's an A/C unit in the room, but no matter what we did to fiddle with it, it just would not get cool. Tiny room + humidity from showers + stubborn A/C + poor window ventilation stuffy stuffy stuffy.What also wasn't fun was being charged an extra 6.35 on my credit card when I checked my billing statement a week after checking out. I called in to ask about the charge and was told we had used the water in the mini bar. We had not. The front desk employee was nice enough to remove the charge, but is it not standard hotel practice to provide a bill of charges to guests before they check out Not doing so is at best questionable (why risk upsetting guests by not verifying mini bar purchases), and at worst predatory (are you just hoping we wouldn't notice). Also, 6 for a bottle of water I get better deals at movie theaters...In conclusion, if you're looking to be in Chicago on a budget, want to be in a good location, and only plan to use the hotel to sleep at night, then the Freehand might be for you. Just make sure to keep an eye on your bank account.Hello Jade Y, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am glad your stay was mostly enjoyable. I am sorry to hear, however, that the room was a little stuffy. I hope this will not stop you from returning in the future. I am also sorry you had a billing error. While I am glad the front desk took care of the issue, I am sorry to hear that it was incorrect. I hope you will consider returning to Freehand again in the future.</td>\n",

       "9828  Hotel location is great. Yards from Michigan but without the chaos. You are greeted by a valet with a smile who asks that you check in on the 20th floor. More smiling, happy folks at the reception desk. Our room was remarkable. The view was terrific but the room was tastefully appointed (a bit on the modern side). We had breakfast at the hotel daily and was very good. The complimentary juice of the day was kinda cool. Roof top bar was hopping and comfortable. All in all, young very accommodating staff, great location and service. We have stayed in Chicago many times.

       "1460  We had a great stay at the Sorrento. Staff was excellent very helpful with suggestions and making reservations for meals, etc. . We stayed in a Queen Suite. It's and older hotel with only 76 rooms but that's the type of hotel we like to stay in. They have a car that will take you anywhere in the downtown area. Location is excellent. Very easy to get around. There's a bar restaurant plus more restaurants and bars within walking distance. we love this review! Thank you for such kind words.

       "3164  I stayed with a friend at the Freehand for two nights in a queen bed private room. The room was quiet and clean, but very small. My friend and I were climbing over each other and our suitcases to move around the room. One thing that ruined the room for us was the lack of control over the temperature of the room. The weather in Chicago that week was in the mid-upper 60s, but the room was WARM. There's an A/C unit in the room, but no matter what we did to fiddle with it, it just would not get cool. Tiny room + humidity from showers + stubborn A/C + poor window ventilation stuffy stuffy stuffy.What also wasn't fun was being charged an extra 6.35 on my credit card when I checked my billing statement a week after checking out. I called in to ask about the charge and was told we had used the water in the mini bar. We had not. The front desk employee was nice enough to remove the charge, but is it not standard hotel practice to provide a bill of charges to guests before they check out Not doing so is at best questionable (why risk upsetting guests by not verifying mini bar purchases), and at worst predatory (are you just hoping we wouldn't notice). Also, 6 for a bottle of water I get better deals at movie theaters...In conclusion, if you're looking to be in Chicago on a budget, want to be in a good location, and only plan to use the hotel to sleep at night, then the Freehand might be for you. Just make sure to keep an eye on your bank account.Hello Jade Y, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am glad your stay was mostly enjoyable. I am sorry to hear, however, that the room was a little stuffy. I hope this will not stop you from returning in the future. I am also sorry you had a billing error. While I am glad the front desk took care of the issue, I am sorry to hear that it was incorrect. I hope you will consider returning to Freehand again in the future.   \n",

       "7458  Room 711- This was a two night stay for a training session and upon checking in I discovered the desk chair was all ripped up (plether- plastic leather) missing from 1/3 of the seat, living room chair was used as a cat scratching post, stained dirty drapes, carpet-not vacuumed, no hot water in the tiny stand-up curtained shower-four mins into the shower-lather on hair and soap all over- (got points for my unfortunate experience). One of the bedroom doors (2 BR suite) had nail heads sticking out (discovered them when placing my hand there). Knowing that it was spring break week, I would think the staff was ready for the crowd- room was not serviced on day 2 of the stay until much later in the afternoon.
